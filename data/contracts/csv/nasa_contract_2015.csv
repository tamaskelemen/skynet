THE PHASE 2 PROGRAM WILL MAKE THE FIRST LARGE SCALE HYBRID GEARS THAT CAN BE RUN IN A ROTATING GEAR RIG WITH IMPOSED TORQUE LOADING. SEVERAL FULL SCALE GEARS WILL BE MADE AS WELL AS FULL SCALE TEST ELEMENTS. TEST RESULTS FROM FULL SCALE TESTING WILL BE APPLIED TO COMPUTER SIMULATION MODELS. THIS EFFORT WILL APPLY TOPOLOGY OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES TO PREDICT THE BEST DESIGN OF THE GEAR ELEMENTS. THIS SHOULD ENABLE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EFFICIENT DESIGNS THAN THOSE FABRICATED AND TESTED IN THE PHASE 1 PROGRAM.

NASA ESTIMATES THAT THE CURRENT MARS TO EARTH TRANSFER RATE OF 6 MBPS MIGHT BE INCREASED TO 600MBPS USING A LASER COMMUNICATION (LC) SYSTEM. BEAM JITTER CAUSED BY SPACECRAFT BASED MOTION MUST BE REDUCED TO SUB-MICRORADIAN LEVELS TO ENABLE BEACONLESS OPTICAL BEAM POINTING. ATA WILL CREATE A COMPACT, LIGHTWEIGHT ISOLATION PLATFORM (CLIP) THAT WILL HOST THE LC COLLIMATOR TELESCOPE AND PROVIDE A STABILIZED PLATFORM TO PREVENT THE 150-MICRORADIAN SPACECRAFT DISTURBANCE ENVIRONMENT FROM REACHING THE LC TERMINAL. TO ENABLE THAT STABILIZATION, ATA WILL DEVELOP AN ULTRALOWANGULAR NOISE CAPACITIVE ANGULAR POSITION SENSOR (CAPS). THE PROPOSED SENSOR WILL HAVE LOW POWER AND HIGH RELIABILITY, WHICH ATA WILL DEMONSTRATE BY PRODUCING TRL 4 PROTOTYPES IN PHASE I AND TRL 5 CLIP ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT UNIT (EDU) IN PHASE II. THE INTEGRATED CLIP OVERALL DESIGN IS A MAJOR INNOVATION. MOST SIGNIFICANTLY, THE PLATFORM PAYLOAD CAPACITY MUST INCREASE FROM THE TYPICAL FEW HUNDRED GRAMS TO AS MUCH AS 50 KILOGRAMS, ROUGHLY TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE, BUT WITHOUT MAJOR GROWTH IN THE MASS OF THE PLATFORM ITSELF. WHILE THE PAYLOAD FORMOST STABLE PLATFORMS IS ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE PLATFORM OVERALL MASS, THE CLIP PAYLOAD MUST BEFROM MORE THAN HALF (3 KG) TO AS MUCH AS 94 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL PLATFORM MASS (3-50 KG PAYLOAD + 3 KG PLATFORM). COMBINED WITH THE LARGE PAYLOAD RANGE, THE NEEDED DISTURBANCE REJECTION FROM 150- MICRORADIAN TO LESS THAN 0.5-MICRORADIAN ACROSS THE BROAD FREQUENCY RANGE OF 0.1 TO 500 HZ REQUIRES INNOVATION IN THE PLATFORM SUSPENSION, HIGH-PERFORMANCE ACTUATORS, SERVO CONTROLS, AND STRUCTURE.

AS OUR EXPERIENCE OF VLBI HARDWARE UPGRADE SHOWED, IMPROVEMENT OF OBSERVING HARDWARE ALONE IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR IMPROVING THE ACCURACY OF STATION POSITION DETERMINATION.

THE ESSENCE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR COMPUTING PATH DELAY THROUGH THE NEUTRAL ATMOSPHERE BY DIRECT INTEGRATION OF EQUATIONS OF RADIO WAVE PROPAGATION USING THE OUTPUT OF NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS OF A NEW GENERATION: REANALYSIS MODEL MERRA, OPERATIONAL MODEL GEOS-5.6 DEVELOPED AT THE NASA GLOBAL MODELING AND ASSIMILATION OFFICE, AND THE CLIMATE FORECAST SYSTEM REANALYSIS DEVELOPED BY NOAA. THE PATH DELAYS WILL BE COMPUTED IN THE FORM THAT CAN BE EASILY UTILIZED BY EXISTING SOFTWARE FOR PROCESSING VLBI, GPS, AND DORIS OBSERVATIONS. THE GOAL IS TO MODEL THE ATMOSPHERE PATH DELAY BETTER AND TO PROVIDE MORE RELIABLE ESTIMATES OF STATION POSITIONS AND SATELLITE ORBITS. OUR APPROACH HINGES ON A SOLUTION OF THREE PROBLEMS THAT WE FOUND IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE PILOT STUDY. THIS INCLUDES 1) DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFICIENT NUMERICAL ALGORITHM FOR EXPANDING THE REFRACTIVITY FIELD OVER A FOUR-DIMENSIONAL TENSOR PRODUCT OF B-SPLINES THAT TRANSFORMS A SET OF DISCRETE REFRACTIVITIES DERIVED FROM THE GRIDDED OUTPUT OF NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS INTO A CONTINUUM FUNCTION WITH SMOOTH PARTIAL DERIVATIVES. 2) FORMULATION OF RADIO WAVE PROPAGATION THROUGH A HETEROGENEOUS CONTINUOUS MEDIUM AS A VARIATIONAL PROBLEM WHICH SOLUTION IS REDUCED TO A SYSTEM OF NON-LINEAR ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF THE 4TH ORDER. 3) DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFICIENT INTERPOLATION METHOD FOR SLANTED PATH DELAYS COMPUTED FOR A GIVEN STATION. THAT ALLOWS TO DECOUPLE COMPUTATION OF PATH DELAY IN THE NEUTRAL ATMOSPHERE FROM GEODETIC DATA ANALYSIS. ALTHOUGH THE NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS CURRENTLY ARE NOT ACCURATE TO THE LEVEL THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO COMPUTE PATH DELAY WITH THE ACCURACY THAT MATCHES THE ACCURACY OF SPACE GEODESY MEASUREMENTS, THEIR USE SHIFTS THE PARADIGM OF A TREATMENT OF PATH DELAY IN THE NEUTRAL ATMOSPHERE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED OVER 40 YEARS AGO. INSTEAD OF USING IN-SITU SURFACE METEOROLOGICAL DATA THAT PROVIDE ESTIMATES OF ZENITH PATH DELAYS WITH A TYPICAL ERROR OF 150-250 MM AND ESTIMATING THE REMAINING DELAYS USING PARTIAL DERIVATIVES, THE SO-CALLED MAPPING FUNCTION, DERIVED FROM A COARSE REGRESSION MODEL, WE CAN COMPUTE THE SLANTED PATH DELAY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE OBSERVING SOURCE OR SATELLITE WITH THE ACCURACY OF 10-15 MM OF THE ZENITH PATH DELAY EQUIVALENT AND TO ESTIMATE RESIDUAL DELAY USING PARTIAL DERIVATIVES COMPUTED FROM THE NUMERICAL WEATHER MODEL. ADVANCES IN NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS WILL MAKE UNNECESSARY ESTIMATION OF PATH DELAY CAUSED BY THE NEUTRAL ATMOSPHERE IN THE FUTURE WHEN EVEN MORE PRECISE NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS WILL BE DEVELOPED. THE PRESENT PROPOSAL SETS THE PATH FOR SUCH A SHIFT IN DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE. THE BENEFITS THAT WE CAN ENJOY RIGHT NOW ARE REDUCING SYSTEMATIC ERRORS ORIGINATING FROM THE A PRIORI MAPPING FUNCTION AND SATISFACTORY MODELING OF THE PATH DELAY AZIMUTHAL DEPENDENCE THAT MAKES ESTIMATION OF THE SO-CALLED TROPOSPHERE GRADIENTS UNNECESSARY. THIS WILL RESULT IN IMPROVEMENT OF STATION POSITION REPEATABILITY AND GETTING A MORE ACCURATE TERRESTRIAL REFERENCE FRAME AND SATELLITE ORBITS. ACCURATE SATELLITE ORBITS ARE THE KEY ELEMENT OF MEAN SEA LEVEL CHANGE MEASUREMENTS.

THESE DATA RODS WEB SERVICES, HOWEVER, THOUGH VISIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE HIS AND THROUGH THE GODDARD EARTH SCIENCES DATA AND INFORMATION SERVICES CENTER (GES DISC), ARE NOT EASILY DISCOVERABLE BY USERS OF OTHER NON-NASA DATA SYSTEMS. THIS IS ALSO THE CASE FOR NASA EOSDIS (EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEM DATA INFORMATION SYSTEM) DATA, IN GENERAL. CONVERSELY, THERE ARE VAST AMOUNTS OF NON-NASA HYDROLOGICAL DATA (E.G., THOSE ACCESSIBLE VIA WEB SERVICES FROM CUAHSI HIS) THAT ARE NOT VISIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE FROM NASA SYSTEMS, SUCH AS THE SIMPLE SUBSET WIZARD (SSW), A COMMON GATEWAY TO DATA ARCHIVED AT NASA DATA CENTERS.

THE INDIVIDUAL WEB FEATURE SERVICES ARE REGISTERED WITH THE GEOSS COMMON INFRASTRUCTURE (GCI) AND SHOWN TO BE DISCOVERABLE THEREIN. EACH FEATURE IN A MAP SERVICE DESCRIBES ONE OBSERVED TIME SERIES ACCESSIBLE AT ONE LOCATION AND, IF AVAILABLE, CONTAINS A LINK TO THAT TIME SERIES SERVICE. FURTHERMORE, IT HAS SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT THIS INFRASTRUCTURE CAN ALSO BE ADAPTED TO PROVIDE TIME SERIES ACCESS TO MODEL GRID INFORMATION (E.G., NLDAS, GLDAS) OR GRIDS OF INFORMATION OVER A GEOGRAPHIC DOMAIN FOR A PARTICULAR TIME INTERVAL. THESE PROTOTYPE EFFORTS HAVE SHOWN THE POTENTIAL FOR ENHANCING DISCOVERY, SEARCH, AND ACCESS OF NASA DATA BY NON- NASA USERS. THAT THESE PROTOTYPES HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT THE PROPOSED WORK CAN BE SIMILARLY CARRIED OUT AND WITH LOW RISK. THE OVERALL APPROACH OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT COMPRISES THE FOLLOWING: 1. LEVERAGE SIMPLE SUBSET WIZARD (SSW) API AND ECHO 2. REGISTER DATA RODS AND ON-THE-FLY (OTF) CONVERTED TIME SERIES SERVICES IN GEOSS 3. DEVELOP WEB FEATURE SERVICES (WFS) FOR DATA RODS AND OTF CONVERTED TIME SERIES 4. ENHANCE METADATA IN WFS 5.

OUR PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVE OF THE EARTH SURFACE AND INTERIOR PROGRAMMATIC INTEREST: GEOPHYSICAL MODELS AND ANALYSIS SYSTEMS THAT ADVANCE REAL-TIME OR NEAR REAL-TIME GEODETIC PRODUCTS DERIVED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FROM ESTABLISHED INFRASTRUCTURE FOCUSED ON MITIGATION OF GEOHAZARDS. PROCESSING SPACE GEODESY OBSERVATIONS REQUIRES DATA REDUCTION FOR EARTH ROTATION THAT VARIES DUE TO 1) EXTERNAL TORQUES EXERTED BY THE MOON, SUN AND PLANETS, AND 2) MASS REDISTRIBUTION IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND HYDROSPHERE. PROCESSING DEDICATED VERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY (VLBI) OBSERVATIONS AS WELL AS OTHER SPACE GEODESY DATA ALLOWS US TO DETERMINE EOPS FOR THE PAST. HOWEVER, FOR PROCESSING REAL-TIME OR NEAR REAL TIME OBSERVATIONS THE EOPS FOR THE CURRENT INSTANT OF TIME ARE NOT AVAILABLE. THE ESSENCE OF OUR PROJECT ARE TWO ELEMENTS. FIRST, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR COMPUTATION OF THE ANGULAR MOMENT OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND HYDROSPHERE FROM THE FORECAST OF THE NASA GLOBAL MODELING AND ASSIMILATION OFFICE (GMAO) MODELS GEOSFP AND GEOS-FPIT THAT COVER THE TIME PERIOD FROM 2000.01.01 IN THE PAST THROUGH 24-36 HOURS IN THE FUTURE. USING ESTIMATES OF THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM, WE COMPUTE THE EARTH ORIENTATION PARAMETERS BY NUMERICAL INTEGRATION OF LIOUVILLE''S EQUATION STARTING FROM THE LATEST EOP MEASUREMENT TAKEN AS AN INITIAL VALUE. SECOND, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AN INTERNET SERVICE THAT WILL ALLOW A USER TO RETRIEVE THE EARTH''S ROTATION MATRIX AND ITS DERIVATIVES ANYTIME SINCE 1979.01.01 TO 24 HOURS IN THE FUTURE IN A TOTALLY AUTOMATIC FASHION USING THE OPENDAP PROTOCOL. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SUCH A SERVICE IS THAT ALL COMPLEXITY OF ACCURATE EOP PREDICTION ON THE BASIS OF NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS AND DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS WILL BE COMPLETELY CARRIED OUT BY THE REMOTE SERVER AND IT WILL NOT REQUIRE A HUMAN INTERVENTION. THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR REAL-TIME OR NEAR REAL-TIME SPACE GEODESY APPLICATIONS, ALTHOUGH NON REAL-TIME APPLICATIONS WILL BENEFIT FROM AUTOMATION AS WELL. IMPROVED ACCURACY OF EOP PREDICTION USING THE OUTPUT OF NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS WILL IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF SITE POSITION DETERMINATION, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR REAL-TIME OR NEAR REAL-TIME APPLICATIONS OF GNSS OBSERVATIONS FOR MONITORING STATION POSITIONS FOR DETECTION OF SEISMIC EVENTS AND PROVIDING HAZARD WARNINGS AND MITIGATION OF DAMAGE FROM EARTHQUAKES, VOLCANIC EVENTS, LANDSLIDES, OR TSUNAMI GENERATION. AUTOMATION OF THE PROCESS OF RETRIEVAL OF THE MOST PRECISE EARTH''S ROTATION MATRIX WILL FACILITATE DEVELOPMENT OF REAL-TIME SPACE GEODESY APPLICATIONS."

ACCURACY OF NUMERICAL MODELS OVER LAND CAN BE EVALUATED BY COMPARISON WITH GROUND METEOROLOGICAL STATIONS, ATMOSPHERIC SOUNDINGS, AND WITH ESTIMATES OF PATH DELAY FROM SPACE GEODESY OBSERVATIONS. HOWEVER, THE ACCURACY OF NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS OVER ANTARCTICA AND GREENLAND WHERE THERE IS A VERY SPARSE NETWORK OF GROUND STATIONS, IS NOT WELL KNOWN. THEREFORE, THE ACCURACY OF THE PATH DELAY COMPUTATION OVER THESE REGIONS IS NOT KNOWN. THE ESSENCE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO USE GPS RADIO OCCULTATION DATA FOR COMPARISON OF OBSERVED PATH DELAYS FROM THESE OBSERVATIONS WITH PREDICTED PATH DELAYS FROM THE NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS THAT ARE USED FOR PROCESSING ICESAT DATA. THE DIFFERENCES WILL BE USED FOR DERIVING THE ERROR MODEL OF ATMOSPHERIC PATH DELAY CORRECTIONS OF ALTIMETRY DATA OVER ANTARCTICA AND GREENLAND. SINCE THERE ARE TOO FEW METEOROLOGICAL STATIONS IN THE INNER PARTS OF ANTARCTICA AND GREENLAND, THE GPS RADIO OCCULTATIONS WILL BE USED AS THE GROUND TRUTH. THE NEAR TERM GOAL IS TO EVALUATE THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE STATE OF THE ATMOSPHERE TO ESTIMATES OF ICE MASS LOSS IN ANTARCTICA AND GREENLAND AND ITS SEASONAL VARIATIONS.

THE TRADITIONAL VIEW STATES THAT SLOW SOLAR WIND ARISES FROM THE BOUNDARIES OF CORONAL HOLES DUE TO THE LARGER EXPANSION FACTOR. IT IS HARD IN THIS EXPLANATION TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE SLOW WIND OCCUPIES SO MUCH SPACE IN THE HELIOSPHERE. PSEUDOSTREAMERS ARE MULTIPOLAR FEATURES WHICH DEVELOP INTO FIELDS THAT ARE UNIPOLAR AT GREATER HEIGHTS.  THERE IS DEBATE AS TO THE SPEED AND NATURE OF THE WIND FROM PSEUDOSTREAMERS: IT COULD BE FAST, SLOW, OR IN BETWEEN. AND, IN GENERAL, THEY MIGHT FORM A NETWORK OF SLOW WIND WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT CONNECT IN THE HELIOSPHERE TO SLOW WIND COMING FROM AROUND THE HELIOSPHERIC CURRENT SHEET.  DIFFERENT TYPES OF PSEUDOSTREAMERS EXIST, WITH A COMPLEX INNER STRUCTURE WHICH DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER OF POLARITIES EMBEDDED IN THE CLOSED REGIONS BELOW.

While high bypass ratio turbofans brought significant improvements to aircraft propulsion, the future will require the use of a different propulsion technology. Turbo-electric propulsion shows great potential to address all the N+3 objectives through the use of electrically driven fans allowing for distributed propulsion. Turbofans are replaced in this approach by ducted fans driven by high power density electric motors. The electrical power is generated by a gas turbine coupled to a high speed, high power density generator. However, the turbo-electric propulsion concept relies on the availability of electric machines with power densities (kW/m3) and specific power (kW/kg) far larger than that of conventional electric machines. Fully superconducting rotating machines have the potential to match the requirements of turbo-electric propulsion and present enabling technology for this application. Superconducting machines require operation at cryogenic temperature that can be achieved by using closed-cycle cryocoolers or liquid cryogen flow such as liquid hydrogen (LH2) that could also be used as energy carrier for propulsion. The development of turbo-electric propulsion for aircrafts requires accurate sizing of superconducting machines and performing the pertinent trade-off analysis to determine the optimum materials and operating temperature. NASA is currently using sizing models for superconducting machines developed by Dr. and his colleagues. These models were developed as part of the NASA URETI on Aeropropulsion Power and Technology (UAPT) and at the Advanced Magnet Lab (AML). The existing models are based on analytical modeling of electric machines published by Miller and Hughes and estimates of the mass of the different components of the machines assuming a given active length. Important AC loss calculations in this model are based on experimental data available in the literature AC losses in superconducting stators are very challenging to estimate as the rotating field from the rotor is phase shifted relative to the phase current which depends on the angular stator position. Furthermore, the magnitude of the applied field is not uniformly distributed, and the armature reaction tends to demagnetize the machine impacting the AC losses. While the outstanding potential of the turbo-electric propulsion has been successfully demonstrated through a few projects, higher fidelity models are needed to perform a more accurate assessment at the system level. AML proposes to develop the next generation of sizing model based on a complete 3D analysis of superconducting machines using semi-analytical methods to calculate the magnetic flux density distribution including all components of the machine. The model will include all relevant areas of design including electromagnetics, thermodynamics and mechanics. Based on semi-analytical methods, the model will enable rapid calculations as needed for system optimization. The model to be developed will be fully validated, first numerically using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and finally experimentally using a superconducting machine developed at AML. Some aspects of fully superconducting machines including the AC losses and the fault behavior have not been sufficiently studied in the past to build reliable models. We therefore propose to focus the experimental validation on those important aspects: The proposed physics-based model will allow to design and optimize aircrafts based on turbo-electric propulsion, which is the first step towards the development of the next generation of more efficient aircrafts with reduced toxic emissions and noise pollution. Such aircrafts would also allow take-off and landing during the night in cities and would dramatically reduce the cost of operation and maintenance."

HOWEVER, ATTEMPTS TO REPRODUCE THE CYCLE OF A CHEMICALLY-INERT, PASSIVE, AND NON-CONDENSABLE (IPN) GAS, ARGON, MEASURED BY MARS ODYSSEY''S GAMMA RAY SPECTROMETER ALSO SHOW MAJOR MISMATCHES, DESPITE THE IPN CYCLE BEING PREDOMINANTLY DETERMINED BY ATMOSPHERIC TRANSPORT.

THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES NASA STRATEGIC GOAL 3, SPECIFICALLY, 3C (ADVANCE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM). THE PROPOSAL IS HIGHLY RELEVANT TO THE MFRP PROGRAM, AS BY INVESTIGATING THE CLIMATE SYSTEM ON MARS WE WILL ADDRESS MARS EXPLORATION PROGRAM GOAL 2A, CHARACTERIZE MARS''S PRESENT ATMOSPHERE, PRESENT CLIMATE AND CLIMATE PROCESSES, BY INVESTIGATING CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF THE MAJOR CLIMATE SYSTEM COMPONENTS, SPECIFICALLY INVESTIGATIONS 1 DETERMINE THE PROCESSES CONTROLLING THE PRESENT DISTRIBUTIONS OF WATER, CARBON DIOXIDE, AND DUST BY DETERMINING THE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM TRENDS (DAILY, SEASONAL AND SOLAR CYCLE) IN THE PRESENT CLIMATE) AND 2 DETERMINE THE PRODUCTION/LOSS, REACTION RATES, AND GLOBAL 3-DIMENSIONAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF KEY PHOTOCHEMICAL SPECIES (E.G., O3, H2O, CO, OH, CH4, SO2).

THE UNDERSTANDING OF THESE PROCESSES AND CONSEQUENTLY THEIR REPRESENTATION IN DYNAMICAL MODELS IS AS YET POORLY DEVELOPED. PART OF THIS LACK OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE LACK OF MODELING FRAMEWORKS AND COMPUTING POWER TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE PROBLEM, BUT THE LACK OF GOOD OBSERVATIONAL ''CALIBRATION'' CASES HAS ALSO PRESENTED AN OBSTACLE. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE PROPOSE TO USE ADVANCES IN COMPUTING POWER AND MODEL DEVELOPMENT TO EMPLOY NESTED SYNOPTIC-TO-MESOSCALE MODELING OF CLOUD SYSTEMS AND MOIST CONVECTION USING MASSIVELY PARALLEL COMPUTING. CRUCIALLY, WE PROPOSE TO FOCUS THE EFFORT ON WELL DOCUMENTED \GREAT WHITE SPOT\"" (GWS) CONVECTIVE CLOUD SYSTEMS ON SATURN. NOT ONLY IS THE MORPHOLOGICAL EVOLUTION OF THESE STORMS WELL OBSERVED USING IMAGING, BUT THERMAL AND TRACE PROCESS DATA EXIST FROM THERMAL OBSERVATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, PARA/ORTHO HYDROGEN OBSERVATIONS PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT CONSTRAINTS ON THE DISTRIBUTION AND VIGOR OF MOIST CONVECTION. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO UNDERSTAND THE PHYSICAL PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH CONVECTIVE STORMS AND THE DYNAMICAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN STORMS AND THE LARGE-SCALE DYNAMICS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE MOIST CONVECTION SCHEME THAT CHARACTERIZES THE WATER AND AMMONIA CLOUD DYNAMICS ON SATURN AND JUPITER AND INVESTIGATE THE FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF CONVECTIVE STORMS AT VARIOUS SCALES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH A NUMERICAL SCHEME WITHIN GLOBAL MODELS IS A CRITICAL PREREQUISITE FOR MAKING FURTHER PROGRESS ON UNDERSTANDING THE GENERAL CIRCULATION OF THE GAS GIANT ATMOSPHERES. WE PROPOSE TO USE IMAGING AND INFRARED OBSERVATIONS FROM CASSINI IN COMBINATION WITH OUR PLANETWRF MODEL TO EXAMINE MOIST CONVECTION, AND SPECIFICALLY THE WELL DOCUMENTED GWS TEST CASE, ON CLOUD RESOLVING SCALES AND ALSO THEIR INTERACTION WITH LARGER-SCALE FLOWS. THE NESTED CLOUD-RESOLVING TO GLOBAL SCALE CAPABILITY OF PLANETWRF MAKES IT A UNIQUELY CAPABLE MODEL IN THIS APPLICATION. THE RESULTS FROM THE USE OF PLANETWRF TO SYNTHESIZE AND GENERALIZED OBSERVATIONS OF MOIST CONVECTION WILL BE USED TO FORMULATE SIMPLIFIED PLUME MODELS OF MOIST CONVECTION THAT CAN BE INCLUDED IN PURELY GLOBAL MODELS OF INSUFFICIENT RESOLUTION TO DIRECTLY CAPTURE THESE PROCESSES. THE GENERAL CIRCULATION OF GAS GIANT ATMOSPHERES IS A MAJOR SCIENCE FOCUS FOR NASA, BOTH IN TERMS OF THE GAS GIANTS IN OUR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM, BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF GAS GIANT DYNAMICS FOR UNDERSTANDING EXTRA-SOLAR PLANETS."""

THEORETICAL, ANALYTICAL OR SIMPLIFIED (E.G. 2D) MODELS PROVIDE A POWERFUL MEANS OF INVESTIGATING SPECIFIC PHENOMENA IN TITAN''S ATMOSPHERE, AND ENABLE HYPOTHESES TO BE FORMED CONCERNING THE RELEVANT MECHANISMS AT WORK. HOWEVER, REAL ATMOSPHERES ARE COMPLICATED BY THREE-DIMENSIONAL PROCESSES, NON-LINEAR INTERACTIONS, AND NUMEROUS FEEDBACKS. THREE-DIMENSIONAL GENERAL CIRCULATION MODELS (GCMS) PROVIDE AN INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK FOR CAPTURING THE LINEAR AND NON-LINEAR INTERACTIONS OF A WIDE RANGE OF PROCESSES, AND ARE THUS REQUIRED TO TEST AND FURTHER DEVELOP HYPOTHESES, TO STUDY THE COMPLETE ATMOSPHERIC SYSTEM, AND TO SIMULATE (AND EVENTUALLY PREDICT) ALL ASPECTS OF THE TIME-VARYING 3D ATMOSPHERE. DESPITE THEIR USEFULNESS, HOWEVER, GCMS (AND PARTICULARLY PLANETARY GCMS) CONTAIN MANY UNKNOWN OR POORLY KNOWN ASSUMPTIONS AND PARAMETERS. A TITAN GCM THEREFORE CANNOT HOPE TO PROPERLY REPRESENT ITS INTENDED ATMOSPHERE UNTIL IT HAS BEEN CONFRONTED WITH SUFFICIENT OBSERVATIONS TO CONSTRAIN THESE PROPERLY, AND IT CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY (BY WHICH WE MEAN WITHIN A SINGLE SIMULATION) MATCH MULTI-INSTRUMENT OBSERVATIONS OF DISPARATE VARIABLES AND FEATURES. IN THIS WORK WE PROPOSE TO CONSTRAIN OUR EXISTING THREE-DIMENSIONAL GCM TITANWRF IN THE THREE AREAS DESCRIBED ABOVE. FOR (1) WE WILL DEVELOP AN OBSERVATION SYSTEM SIMULATION EXPERIMENT FOR THE CASSINI CIRS INSTRUMENT, USING IT TO COMPARE CIRS RADIANCES WITH TITANWRF PREDICTIONS, AND TO ASSESS WHETHER OBSERVATIONS SUPPORT THE EXISTENCE AND NATURE OF THE WAVE DRIVEN ANGULAR MOMENTUM TRANSFER EVENTS THAT ARE KEY TO PRODUCING STRATOSPHERIC SUPERROTATION IN TITANWRF. FOR (2) WE WILL ADD NEW PARAMETERIZATIONS OF METHANE CYCLE PROCESSES (INCLUDING MOIST CONVECTION AND SUB-SURFACE DIFFUSION) AND VARY TITANWRF''S PHYSICAL PARAMETERS, WITH THE AIM OF PRODUCING THE BEST MATCH TO THE OBSERVED METHANE CYCLE. FOR (3) WE WILL USE REALISTIC TOPOGRAPHY TO PREDICT GLOBAL AND MESOSCALE DUNE CHARACTERISTICS BASED ON THE LONG-TERM WIND FIELD, PROVIDING AN INDIRECT BUT RIGOROUS MEANS OF TESTING THE NEAR-SURFACE ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION PREDICTED BY TITANWRF, CONSTRAINING THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE WINDS (FROM SURFACE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS TO PHYSICAL PROCESSES), AND INVESTIGATING MECHANISMS BEHIND THE OBSERVED CHARACTERISTICS OF TITAN''S DUNES. AS WE REQUIRE TITANWRF TO SIMULTANEOUSLY MATCH OBSERVATIONS IN ALL THREE AREAS, RESULTS OF EACH INVESTIGATION WILL GUIDE WORK IN THE OTHERS, AND OUTPUT FROM OUR EVENTUAL `MOST REALISTIC'' GCM ENCAPSULATING OUR BEST UNDERSTANDING OF TITAN WILL BE MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE VIA THE PLANETARY DATA SYSTEM (PDS) FOR WIDER COMMUNITY USE."

THE MODULUS OF TITANIUM IS LOWER THAN LEGACY SPACESUIT BEARING MATERIALS (STAINLESS STEEL). DUE TO THIS, TITANIUM BEARINGS ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DEFLECTION UNDER MAN AND PLUG LOAD SCENARIOS. BEARING DEFLECTION CAUSES A LIMITED NUMBER OF BALLS TO ABSORB THE FULL LOAD AND RESULTS IN HIGHER, LOCALIZED, CONTACT STRESSES. LOCALIZED CONTACT STRESS IS BELIEVED TO BE THE MAIN CONTRIBUTOR TO THE BEARING RACE DEGRADATION OBSERVED DURING NASA\'S 2014 OXYGEN COMPATIBILITY TESTING. IN PHASE 1, WE WILL CORRELATE ANALYTICAL CONTACT STRESS DATA WITH SAMPLE BEARING TEST DATA. THIS CORRELATION WILL CHARACTERIZE BEARING WEAR AND DEGRADATION RELATIVE TO BALL CONTACT STRESS. MULTIPLE TEST ITERATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED TO CLEARLY IDENTIFY THE CONTACT STRESS THAT DEGRADES A TITANIUM RACE. WE WILL ALSO DETERMINE IF THERE ARE COMMERCIAL SURFACE TREATMENTS (COATINGS) THAT MAY ENHANCE TITANIUM WEAR RESISTANCE. AT THE CONCLUSION OF PHASE 1, WE SHALL HAVE IDENTIFIED THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE BEARING CONTACT STRESS. THIS DATA POINT WILL SERVE AS A VALUABLE DESIGN GUIDELINE FOR FUTURE BEARING DESIGNS AND SHOULD YIELD REDUCED CERTIFICATION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS."

THESE ARE AREAS THAT ARE KNOWN TO HAVE LARGE CONTACT STRESSES DUE TO NON-UNIFORM LOADING THROUGH AXIAL RESTRAINT LINES. THIS LOADING YIELDS INCREASED STRESSES IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE RACE. WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE MAX EXPECTED STRESS, THE BEARING DESIGN CAN BE MADE TO ACCOMMODATE ALL CONTACT STRESSES APPLIED TO THE RACE. THE PHASE II EFFORT WILL CONSIST OF FINDING THE MAXIMUM EXPECTED CONTACT STRESSES IN THESE BEARINGS THROUGH BOTH TEST AND FEA SIMULATION. THE BEARING DESIGNS CAN THEN BE OPTIMIZED TO REDUCE THE CONTACT STRESSES IN THESE AREAS. AIR-LOCK WILL MANUFACTURE DVT UNITS IN ORDER TO CYCLE TEST THE OPTIMIZED BEARINGS.

ADDITIONALLY, RATES OF C BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSING ARE COMMONLY MUCH GREATER IN INLAND WATERS THAN TERRESTRIAL LANDSCAPES, AS THEY COLLECTIVELY STORE C IN SEDIMENTS, EXPORT C TO OCEANS, AND EMIT CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) AND METHANE (CH4) TO THE ATMOSPHERE. TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS ARE A DOMINANT SOURCE OF C TO INLAND WATERS THROUGH SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE NETWORKS. THESE NETWORKS ARE CHANGING ACROSS BOREAL AND ARCTIC REGIONS, AS PERMAFROST THAW, CLIMATE WARMING, AND FIRE CREATE NEW CONDUITS FOR WATER MOVEMENT, CHANGE VEGETATIVE WATER USE AND EVAPOTRANSPIRATION, AND ALTER THE DISTRIBUTION OF WATER ON THE LANDSCAPE. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS OF THESE CHANGES IN THE WATER CYCLE IF WE ARE TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCURATELY PROJECT THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE WARMING AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS ON CIRCUMBOREAL AND ARCTIC ECOSYSTEMS. WE PROPOSE AN INTEGRATED INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH CAMPAIGN TO EVALUATE THE VULNERABILITY OF BOREAL LANDSCAPES TO CHANGE IN THE \PLUMBING\"" THAT CONTROLS WATER MOVEMENT AND DISTRIBUTION, CHANGE IN THE SOURCE AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF C DELIVERED TO INLAND WATERS, AND CHANGE IN THE RATES AND PROCESSES THAT CONTROL ORGANIC AND INORGANIC C PROCESSING BY INLAND WATERS AND THEIR EMISSIONS OF CO2 AND CH4 TO THE ATMOSPHERE. OUR APPROACH RECOGNIZES THAT PERMAFROST THAW WILL NOT ONLY ENHANCE GROUNDWATER FLOW AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUBSURFACE CONNECTIVITY, BUT THAT LOSS OF SUBSURFACE ICE WILL ALSO CHANGE THE STRUCTURE OF THE LAND SURFACE, CREATING THERMOKARST FEATURES IN SOME AREAS AND INITIATING LAKE LOSS OR LAKE CREATION IN OTHERS. IT ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT TERRESTRIAL SOURCES OF C TO INLAND WATERS WILL CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO THAW, FIRE AND OTHER DRIVERS OF CHANGE. THESE CONDITIONS WILL BE EVALUATED BY GEOPHYSICAL AND ECOSYSTEM SURVEYS WITH THE GOAL OF EXTRAPOLATION ACROSS THE BOREAL ABOVE DOMAIN THROUGH REMOTE SENSING ANALYSIS AND MAPPING. GEOPHYSICAL SUBSURFACE PERMAFROST CHARACTERIZATION VIA NEW GROUND AND EXISTING AIRBORNE SURVEYS WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY FRAMEWORK FOR HYDROLOGIC FIELD AND MODELING EFFORTS TO EVALUATE AND PROJECT THE EFFECTS OF CHANGE IN LATERAL CONNECTIVITY ON SURFACE WATER FLOW, GROUNDWATER FLOW, AND LAKE DISTRIBUTION. PERMAFROST THAW ENHANCES GROUNDWATER FLOW, CHANGES THE SEASONAL DISTRIBUTION OF STREAMFLOW, AND ALTERS LAKE BUDGETS. HOWEVER, THE DYNAMICS THAT CONTROL THESE CHANGES ARE NOT COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD, AND CRITICAL BASELINE INFORMATION ON SUBSURFACE PERMAFROST DISTRIBUTION IS TYPICALLY LACKING. USING NEWLY DEVELOPED CAPABILITIES FOR COLD REGIONS, OUR PROPOSED FIELD AND MODELING APPROACHES WILL HELP TO FILL THESE GAPS IN HYDROLOGIC UNDERSTANDING AND WILL ALSO INFORM ON THE ROUTING OF TERRESTRIAL C BY FLOW SYSTEMS TO INLAND WATERS AND THE RESIDENCE TIME OF C IN THOSE SYSTEMS. SOURCE, ROUTING, AND RESIDENCE TIME ARE IMPERATIVE TO UNDERSTANDING C DYNAMICS IN INLAND WATERS. WE WILL DETERMINE C SOURCE AND AGE THROUGH ANALYSES OF THE 14C CONTENT OF INORGANIC AND ORGANIC C SPECIES AND C-GAS EMISSIONS. MOLECULAR BIOMARKERS, COUPLED WITH MEASURED OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF DOC WILL INFORM ON TERRESTRIAL VERSUS AUTOCHTHONOUS SOURCES OF AQUATIC C AND ON ITS POTENTIAL FOR MINERALIZATION BY BIOLOGICAL OR PHOTO- DEGRADATION. MUCH OF TERRESTRIALLY-DERIVED AQUATIC C IS DEGRADED BEFORE REACHING SURFACE WATERS, SO HYDROLOGIC MODELING OF RESIDENCE TIMES WILL IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE AND WHEN INLAND WATER C-GAS EMISSIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE GREATEST. RADIOCARBON AGE OF AQUATIC C WILL FURTHER DELINEATE SOURCE AND INFORM ON IF AND WHERE C DERIVED FROM PERMAFROST OR ANCIENT SOIL SOURCES ARE DELIVERED TO INLAND WATERS. FINALLY, OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF WATER INDICATIVE OF DOC CONCENTRATION AND COMPOSITION WILL BE RELATED TO REMOTELY SENSED LAKE COLOR AND TO THE POTENTIAL FOR C-G S EMISSION, WITH THE GOAL OF EXTRAPOLATING INLAND WATER DOC COMPOSITION AND CO2 AND CH4 EMISSIONS ACROSS THE ABOVE DOMAIN."""

IT IS LIKELY THAT UNDER THE EXTREME CONDITIONS OF THE SIMULATED IMPACT EVENTS THE SUGARS IN SOLUTION WILL FORM MORE COMPLEX MOLECULES, SUCH AS THREOSE (FORMED FROM THE DIMERIZATION OF GLYCOLALDEHYDE) OR FRUCTOSE (FORMED FROM THE DIMERIZATION OF DIHYDROXYACETONE). THIS OUTCOME WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT TO UNDERSTANDING THE DELIVERY AND SUBSEQUENT SHOCK CHEMISTRY OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOMOLECULES BECAUSE IT WOULD SHOW THAT THESE MOLECULES COULD SURVIVE IMPACT EVENTS TO FORM MORE COMPLEX MOLECULES."

IMPORTANTLY, THEY CAN ALSO BE USED TO ADDRESS THE PERSISTENT QUESTION OF THE NATURE OF THE LUNAR IMPACT FLUX. THIS PROJECT INVOLVES ANALYZING IMPACT GLASSES FROM SELECTED APOLLO 14, 15, 16, AND 17 REGOLITH SAMPLES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE MORE DATA THAT CAN BE USED TO EVALUATE THE NATURE OF THE LUNAR IMPACT FLUX. DECIPHERING THE LUNAR IMPACT HISTORY IS A COMPLEX PROCESS AND MANY TYPES OF SAMPLES ARE BEING STUDIED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. LUNAR IMPACT GLASSES ARE NUMEROUS; THEIR COMPOSITIONS TELL US WHERE THEY WERE FORMED, WHILE THEIR 40AR/39AR AGES TELL US WHEN THEY WERE FORMED. THUS, LUNAR IMPACT GLASSES CAN PROVIDE USEFUL INSIGHT INTO THE IMPACT RATE IN THE EARTH-MOON SYSTEM. HUNDREDS OF LUNAR IMPACT GLASSES HAVE BEEN SELECTED FROM SAMPLES 14259, 15221, 64501, 66041, AND 71501. COMPOSITIONS AND AGES OF THESE GLASSES CAN BE USED TO CONSTRAIN THE TIMING OF THE LUNAR IMPACT FLUX. METHODOLOGY: MAJOR- AND TRACE-ELEMENT ANALYSES ON THE LUNAR GLASS SAMPLES WILL BE DONE BY ELECTRON MICROPROBE AND LASER ABLATION ICPMS, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE THE ARGON ISOTOPES WILL BE MEASURED BY THE THERMO ARGUS VI MULTI-COLLECTOR NOBLE GAS MASS SPECTROMETER AT CURTIN UNIVERSITY. THIS STATE-OF-THE-ART INSTRUMENT HAS HIGH SENSITIVITY AND IS PARTICULARLY WELL-SUITED FOR ISOTOPIC ANALYSES OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF ARGON. WE WILL THEN COMPARE OUR NEW RESULTS TO EXISTING DATA, WITH THE GOAL OF ADDING TO THE 40AR/39AR DATA SETS OF LUNAR SAMPLE AGES IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF LUNAR IMPACTS OVER TIME. RELEVANCE: LUNAR GLASSES PROVIDE COMPOSITIONAL INFORMATION, WHICH IS USEFUL FOR CHARACTERIZING THE CHEMICAL AND MINERALOGICAL FEATURES OF THE LUNAR SURFACE. AGES OF IMPACT GLASSES CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT RATE IN THE EARTH-MOON SYSTEM (AND PERHAPS THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM), A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IN LUNAR SCIENCE. RESULTS FROM THESE STUDIES WILL ELUCIDATE THE EVOLUTION AND MODIFICATION OF THE LUNAR SURFACE AND ADDRESS THE NATURE OF THE LUNAR IMPACT FLUX. THESE TASKS WILL LEAD TO RESULTS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW OBJECTS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM HAVE EVOLVED."

CURRENTLY, THE ONLY AVAILABLE MEASUREMENT OF ICP IS A POSTFLIGHT OPENING PRESSURE VIA LUMBAR PUNCTURE (LP). GIVEN THE INVASIVENESS OF LP AND THE RELUCTANCE TO UTILIZE IT IN THE ABSENCE OF CLINICAL INDICATIONS, ICP ELEVATIONS ARE YET TO BE CONSISTENTLY DOCUMENTED IN CREWMEMBERS. IN ADDITION, THE CAUSE FOR ICP ELEVATION IN-FLIGHT HAS NOT YET BEEN ESTABLISHED. CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS OF THE VIIP SYNDROME MAINLY FOCUS ON THE VASCULAR AND INTERSTITIAL COMPONENTS OF THE CEPHALAD FLUID REDISTRIBUTION. AN OVERLOOKED COMPONENT OF FLUID SHIFT THAT THIS STUDY WILL EVALUATED IS THE REDISTRIBUTION OF CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) IN THE CRANIOSPINAL SYSTEM AND ITS EFFECT ON ICP. AS THE CRANIUM CONTAINS MORE CSF THAN BLOOD, THIS COMPONENT OF FLUID SHIFT MAY BE A LARGER CONTRIBUTOR TO ICP ELEVATIONS THAN THE VASCULAR/INTERSTITIAL COMPONENTS. THE POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN SPINAL CANAL COMPLIANCE BUFFERING DUE TO SPINAL ELONGATION MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO ICP ELEVATIONS AS WELL.THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL UTILIZE SPECIALIZED MRI SEQUENCES, COLLECTED ON 7 SHORT-DURATION AND 10 LONG-DURATION CREWMEMBERS, TO ASSESS CSF HYDRODYNAMICS AND VASCULAR HEMODYNAMICS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO VIIP. KEY PARAMETERS THAT WILL BE ANALYZED INCLUDE TOTAL CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW, VENOUS DRAINAGE, INTRACRANIAL COMPLIANCE AND PRESSURE AS WELL AS CRANIO-SPINAL COMPLIANCE DISTRIBUTION. THESE VALUES WILL BE CORRELATED WITH CHANGES IN VISUAL/OCULAR FUNCTION AND MORPHOLOGY, AND MEASURES OF SPINAL ELONGATION. EFFECTS OF MISSION DURATION WILL BE ELUCIDATED BY COMPARING SHORT AND LONG-DURATION CREWMEMBERS. THESE ANALYSES WILL ELUCIDATE THE ROLE OF CEPHALAD CSF SHIFT IN THE ETIOLOGY OF VIIP, WILL DEFINE HYDRODYNAMIC MEASURES THAT MAY PREDICT SUSCEPTIBILITY TO VIIP, AND MAY LEAD TO IDENTIFICATION OF NOVEL COUNTERMEASURES. THIS STUDY WILL BE CONSTRAINED BY THE NUMBER OF SUBJECT MRIS AVAILABLE FOR ANALYSIS, COMPARED WITH AN OPTIMAL TERRESTRIAL STUDY WHERE MORE SUBJECTS WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR STUDY."

TO DESIGN AND CHARACTERIZE A 24 GSPS (GIGASAMPLES PER SECOND), WIDE INPUT BANDWIDTH (40 GHZ), 6-BIT (5.0 EFFECTIVE NUMBER OF BITS, ENOB), LOW-POWER (700 MW), AND LOW-COST ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL CONVERTER (ADC) FOR USE IN A WIDE RANGE OF NASA''S MICROWAVE SENSOR REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS. THE ADC DOES NOT EMPLOY TIME-INTERLEAVING AND PROVIDES A VERY WIDE SPUR FREE INPUT BANDWIDTH MAKING IT MORE SUITABLE TO NASA''S REMOTE SENSING MISSIONS AND A VARIETY OF RADIO ASTRONOMY APPLICATIONS THAN ANY OTHER ADC AVAILABLE. IN ADDITION, THE ADC WILL BE RADIATION HARD (>300KRAD) AND THUS SUITABLE FOR USE ON-BOARD SPACE MISSIONS. A KEY INNOVATION IN ALPHACORE''S APPROACH TO THE ADC DESIGN IS THAT WE HAVE CONSIDERED HOW THE ADC WILL BE USED IN A SYSTEM; A CUSTOM DESIGNED DIGITAL BACK-END IMPLEMENTS DIGITAL DATA DE-MULTIPLEXING AND SIGNAL CONDITIONING TO ALLOW SEAMLESS INTEGRATION WITH COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE, HIGH-END, FIELD PROGRAMMABLE GATE ARRAYS (FPGA) THAT ARE THE MAIN BUILDING BLOCKS OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC SPECTROMETERS AND INTERFEROMETERS. ALPHACORE''S ADC PROVIDES THESE IMPROVEMENTS AT MUCH LOWER POWER AND LOWER COST THAN EXISTING COMMERCIAL ADCS THAT USE OFF-CHIP COMPONENTS TO PROVIDE THESE FEATURES.

THIS WILL BE ESPECIALLY RELEVANT AS NETWORKED CLUSTERS OF SMALLER-SIZE SATELLITES, MADE OF CUBESATS OR MICROSATELLITES, ARE MORE AND MORE USED IN PLACE OF A SINGLE MONOLITHIC SATELLITE. THE PROPOSED WIDEBAND AUTONOMOUS COGNITIVE RADIOS (WACRS) PROVIDE AN IDEAL APPROACH TO ACHIEVING SUCH AUTONOMOUS AND NETWORK-AWARE COMMUNICATIONS. THE BLUECOM TEAM PROPOSES TO DESIGN AND DEVELOP WACRS DURING THE PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT BY INTEGRATING A REAL-TIME RECONFIGURABLE RADIO FRONT-END AND A FIELD PROGRAMMABLE GATE ARRAY IMPLEMENTED COGNITIVE ENGINE ON TO A SOFTWARE-DEFINED RADIO (SDR) PLATFORM.   WACRS WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO SENSE STATE OF THE RF SPECTRUM AND NETWORK AND SELF-OPTIMIZE ITS PERFORMANCE IN RESPONSE TO THE SENSED STATE. THE COGNITIVE ENGINE IS MADE OF MACHINE-LEARNING AIDED ALGORITHMS TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. THE SDR PLATFORM COUPLED WITH A REAL-TIME RECONFIGURABLE RF FRONT-END WILL ALLOW THE WACR TO RECONFIGURE ITS COMMUNICATION MODE AS DIRECTED BY THE COGNITIVE ENGINE. THIS WILL ENABLE A WACR TO OVERCOME COMMUNICATIONS CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED IN SPACE APPLICATIONS INCLUDING INTERFERENCE, DEEP FADING, WAVEFORM AGILITY, DELAY AND VERY LOW SNR BY DYNAMICALLY CHANGING ITS MODE OF OPERATION. THIS TYPE OF SELF-AWARE, AUTONOMOUS AND INTELLIGENT COMMUNICATION IS WHAT WILL BE REQUIRED TO EXPLOIT THE FULL BENEFITS OF NETWORKED CLUSTERS OF SATELLITES (E.G. CUBESATS) IN VARIOUS MISSION TYPES INCLUDING EARTH MONITORING AND UNMANNED AUTONOMOUS LUNAR/ PLANETARY EXPLORATION.

THE THREE WORKSHOPS PROPOSED HERE WILL FOCUS ON FOUR ONGOING AND URGENT SOCIETAL TRENDS THAT CREATE CRITICAL CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES: 1) DECLINING MARGINS WORLDWIDE IN CRITICAL RESOURCES, MOST NOTABLY FOOD, WATER, AND ENERGY AVAILABILITY, 2) THE NEED TO MANAGE NATURAL RESOURCES HOLISTICALLY TO SIMULTANEOUSLY BUILD RESILIENCE TO NATURAL HAZARDS, PROMOTE ENVIRONMENTAL WELL BEING, AND EXTRACT ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES FOR HUMANITY (OFTEN FROM IRREPLACEABLE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES), 3) THE GROWING DIAGNOSTIC POWER OF NEW SATELLITE BASED INSTRUMENTS AND TECHNOLOGIES, AND 4) MOUNTING CAPABILITIES OF DATA ANALYTICS FOR QUICKLY TEASING NEW UNDERSTANDING OUT OF DIVERSE HIGH VOLUME, HIGH VELOCITY DATA STREAMS (I.E., BIG DATA). THESE ARE COMPLEX SOCIETAL TRENDS THAT TOUCH ON ALL ASPECTS OF THE NATIONAL AGENDA AND FOR WHICH PROGRESS WILL: DEPEND ON IMPROVED EARTH OBSERVATIONS, SCIENCE, AND SERVICES; REQUIRE ADVANCES IN BOTH BASIC AND APPLIED SCIENCE; RELY ON PRACTITIONERS FROM A WIDE RANGE OF DISCIPLINES THROUGHOUT THE WEATHER, WATER, AND CLIMATE SCIENCES; AND BENEFIT GREATLY FROM EFFECTIVE COLLABORATION AMONG THE PUBLIC, PRIVATE, ACADEMIC, AND NGO SECTORS. CRITICALLY, EFFORTS TO: UNDERSTAND THESE SOCIETAL TRENDS; TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR ACCOUNTING FOR THEM; AND TO EMPOWER THE NEEDED COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE MUST BE SUSTAINED OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. THEREFORE, THIS PROJECT WILL CONSIST OF INTERRELATED WORKSHOPS AND COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES THAT BUILD UPON ONE ANOTHER OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD. THE NEED FOR ADVANCES IN EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND SCIENCE IS GROWING MORE URGENT AS BOTH OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS RELATED TO THE EARTH SYSTEM BECOME MORE COMPLEX. THE COMBINATION OF ACTIVITES PROPOSED HERE WILL HELP PROVIDE THE LONG TERM, STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND CAPACITY BUILDING NEEDED FOR ADVANCEMENT. AS A RESULT, THE ACTIVITIES PROPOSED HERE WILL HELP THE NATION, AND THE WORLD, MANAGE RISKS AND REALIZE OPPORTUNITIES ASSOCIATED WITH WEATHER, WATER, AND CLIMATE."

Sub-micron mineral dust, still present in the fine-grained matrix of meteorites, coagulated and melted to form macroscopic clasts: once-molten Mg-silicate chondrules; the oldest solar system rocks, Ca-, Al-rich inclusions (CAIs); amoeboid-olivine-aggregates (AOAs). Different meteorite types (i.e., parent bodies) contain distinct abundances and sizes of chondrules and CAIs and their chemical and textural subtypes. We request support to measure the abundances, sizes, chemical compositions, and detailed crystallization histories of the objects (chondrules, CAIs, AOAs) that accreted together to form the most primitive meteorites. We will use this information in collaboration with astrophysical modelers to understand how these objects may have been formed and sorted into the different meteorite classes, and how that process bears on planet formation. Using previous support, we developed new techniques of 3D imaging, x-ray mapping and image analysis. We showed that existing abundance and size data collected long ago are not correct. We will address these questions with our measurements: What were the temperature, pressure, and volatile element distributions, local mixing and transport dynamics, and accretion chronologies during chondrite formation? Were high-temperature objects formed near the sun and transported outward? How did they mix in just the right proportions to yield different meteorite types, all with very similar overall chemical compositions? We also propose to use serial thin sectioning with a 30 micron wire saw to allow us to explore in unprecedented detail the crystallization histories and chemical, isotopic evolution during cooling of the oldest objects formed in the solar system: CAIs and AOAs. We will apply similar techniques, and 3D imaging, to find and explore layered chondrules that show evidence of repeated heating events in space before accretion. We will then apply state-of-the-art thermodynamic models to the chemical and isotopic data, in modeling how these objects formed in space. Finally, we will apply the same modeling tools to understanding the conditions of formation of minerals discovered in comet samples returned by the Stardust mission. These studies, together, bear directly on outstanding problems in cosmochemistry, at the interfaces between astrophysical theories, observations of far-away disks, and study of samples here on Earth."

WE WILL DEVELOP NEW CAPABILITIES USING OUR NEW LSM 710 CONFOCAL MICROSCOPE INSTALLED IN 2010. WE CAN SEE AEROGEL FLUORESCENCE IN BACKGROUND AEROGEL, AND REFLECTANCE FROM ALL SOLID GRAINS, ALL IN 34 CHANNELS OF IMAGE WAVELENGTHS. OUR GOALS INCLUDE USING OPTICAL METHODS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN COMETARY PARTICLES AND MELTED AEROGEL CAPTURE MEDIUM, AND COMBINING OUR RESULTS WITH SIMILAR IMAGING OF ANALOG TRACKS WITH KNOWN IMPACTORS, AND DEVELOPING MODELS OF HYPERVELOCITY IMPACTS IN AEROGEL. SUCH MODELS WILL ALLOW US TO INFER THE ORIGINAL POROSITY, MASS, AND VOLATILE CONTENT OF GRAINS FROM COMET 81P/WILD 2, CAPTURED IN AEROGEL TILES BY THE STARDUST MISSION. THESE ARE THE FIRST SOLID SAMPLES RETURNED TO EARTH FROM AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL BODY SINCE THE APOLLO ERA. LCSM ALLOWS RAPID 3D IMAGING OF COMPLETE COMET GRAIN TRACKS IN AEROGEL KEYSTONES AT #tilde#80 NM LATERAL SPATIAL RESOLUTION, AND #tilde#300 NM RESOLUTION ALONG THE OPTICAL AXIS, ALL ON A BENCH-TOP INSTRUMENT AT THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY. WE WILL DEVELOP COMPUTED 3D DECONVOLUTION METHOD FOR THE NEW LSM 710, ALREADY PERFECTED FOR THE OPTICS OF AN OLDER CONFOCAL MICROSCOPE (C. 1997). THIS IS NECESSARY TO CORRECT FOR MINOR DISTORTION OF REFLECTED LIGHT ALONG THE OPTICAL AXIS OF THE MICROSCOPE. OUR IMAGE ANALYSIS YIELDS HIGHLY ACCURATE 3D TRACK GEOMETRY, GRAIN SIZE AND GRAIN DISTRIBUTION. THE XRF ANALYSIS AT 1-5 MICRON/PIXEL TELLS US WHERE COMETARY GRAINS ARE, AND THE LOCATION OF POTENTIALLY HIGH-PRIORITY GRAINS. ALL THIS WORK CAN BE DONE PRIOR TO DESTRUCTIVE FLATTENING OF TRACKS, OR GRAIN REMOVAL. OUR IMAGING CAN BE DONE ON INTACT TRACKS EVEN AFTER REMOVAL OF LARGE TERMINAL PARTICLES. IMAGE DATA REMAIN ACCESSIBLE FOR FURTHER POST-PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS. THIS WORK IS FUNDAMENTAL TO NASA GOALS FOR MAXIMUM STARDUST DATA RETRIEVAL FOR UNDERSTANDING SOLAR SYSTEM ORIGINS. OUR GOAL IS TO IMAGE AS MANY TRACKS AS POSSIBLE AT USING LCSM, AND MAP GRAIN CHEMISTRY USING 2-D OR STEREO-PAIR XRF IMAGING. THIS SUITE OF 3D-DATA ADDS STATISTICAL POWER TO ANALYSES OF THE WHOLE SUITE OF DUST ENTRY PATHS, AND GRAIN FRAGMENTATION SYSTEMATICS. OUR COMBINED LCSM+XRF RESULTS WILL REVEAL LOCATIONS OF GRAINS WITH INTERESTING CHEMICAL COMPOSITIONS, PARTICULARLY SMALLER ONES IN TRACK BULBS. WE WILL MAKE THESE DATA AVAILABLE TO INVESTIGATORS EXTRACTING AND ANALYZING STARDUST GRAINS IN FURTHER (DESTRUCTIVE) STAGES OF THE EXAMINATION PROCESS."

THIS DISCOVERY OF AREAS RICH IN (MG,FE)-AL SPINEL ON THE RIMS AND CENTRAL PEAKS OF LUNAR IMPACT HAS REVIVED THE OLD PUZZLE OF THE ORIGIN OF LUNAR SPINEL. HOWEVER, THE ORIGIN AND MECHANISM(S) OF FORMATION OF SUCH SPINEL-RICH ROCKS ARE NOT CLEAR. IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTUAL SPINELRICH SAMPLES FROM THE MOON, VERIFICATION OF THE VALIDITY OF ANY HYPOTHESIS OF ORIGIN WILL REMAIN SPECULATIVE. TO DATE, ONLY ONE SPINELRICH MATERIAL HAS BEEN DESCRIBED IN A METEORITE SAMPLE (GROSS ET AL., 2011; GROSS AND TREIMAN, 2011). CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS CRITICAL TO ANALYZE THIS FRAGMENT AND ADDITIONAL SPINEL-BEARING ROCKS FROM THE LUNAR HIGHLAND CRUST, IN DETAIL BY PETROGRAPHY, MINERAL CHEMISTRY, LIQUIDUS/CRYSTALLIZATION EXPERIMENTS, AND SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE OF THE EXPERIMENTAL RUN PRODUCTS. SUCH ANALYSES WILL PROVIDE CONSTRAINTS ON THE PETROGENESIS OF SPINEL-RICH ROCKS ON THE MOON, AND OFFER VALUABLE INSIGHTS INTO SPINEL-RICH MATERIAL THAT WILL PROVIDE A MORE DIVERSE DATASET USABLE AS GROUND TRUTH BOTH FOR CALIBRATION AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SPINEL-RICH REFLECTANCE SPECTRA OBSERVED BY M3. THE LONG-TERM GOALS IN THIS RESEARCH ARE: (1) TO PROVIDE CONSTRAINTS ON THE ORIGIN AND FORMATION HISTORY(S) OF MG-AL SPINEL-RICH AND SPINEL-BEARING LUNAR HIGHLAND SAMPLES AND THUS TO PROVIDE IMPORTANT NEW CLUES FOR THE COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE LUNAR CRUST AND (2) TO OFFER A CRUCIAL LINK BETWEEN THE SMALL-SCALE PERSPECTIVE OF ROCKS AND METEORITES AND THE GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE OF ORBITAL REMOTE SENSING. AT THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS RESEARCH, WE WILL HAVE PROVIDED NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE COMPOSITIONAL INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE LUNAR CRUST, ITS MAGMATIC HISTORY, AND THE EVOLUTION OF LUNAR IMPACT PRODUCTS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, OUR ANALYSES WILL HAVE PROVIDED THE KEY CONSTRAINTS ON THE PETROGENESIS, ORIGIN, AND FORMATION HISTORY(S) OF SPINEL-RICH ROCKS ON THE MOON, AND OFFER VALUABLE INSIGHTS INTO SPINEL-RICH MATERIAL AND THE SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE ROCKS. THIS WILL PROVIDE A MORE DIVERSE DATASET USABLE AS GROUND TRUTH BOTH FOR CALIBRATION AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SPINEL-RICH REFLECTANCE SPECTRA OBSERVED BY M3. THESE FINDINGS WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO OUR OVERALL UNDERSTANDING OF THE LUNAR PETROGENESIS, THE STRUCTURE OF THE LUNAR CRUST, AND THE EVOLUTION OF THE MOON."

THEIR FORMATION REQUIRES RAPID HEATING TO TEMPERATURES OF AROUND 1800 K, FOLLOWED BY COOLING AT RATES OF AROUND 1000 K/HOUR, FAR SLOWER THAN THE FREE-SPACE COOLING TIME OF SUCH MILLIMETER-SIZED OBJECTS. IDENTIFYING THE MECHANISM FOR THIS UBIQUITOUS HEATING AND COOLING HAS REMAINED A PROBLEM FOR OVER A CENTURY. SIMILAR HIGH-TEMPERATURE MINERALS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN INTERPLANETARY DUST OF COMETARY ORIGIN, AND OBSERVED TRANSITIONS FROM AMORPHOUS TO CRYSTALLINE SILICATE SUGGEST HIGH-TEMPERATURE PROCESSING OF DUST IN OTHER PROTOPLANETARY DISKS. THE SHORT CIRCUIT INSTABILITY THAT WE HAVE RECENTLY DISCOVERED INTERMITTENTLY HEATS PROTOPLANETARY DISKS, PRODUCING THIN SHEETS HOT ENOUGH TO SATISFY THESE CONSTRAINTS. WE PROPOSE TO DETERMINE THE ROLE OF THIS INSTABILITY IN MINERAL FORMATION IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS. MELTING A LARGE FRACTION OF THE SOLIDS IN A PROTOPLANETARY DISK REQUIRES A SUBSTANTIAL SOURCE OF ENERGY. THE SHORT-CIRCUIT INSTABILITY CAN TAP THE HUGE RESERVOIR CONTAINED IN THE DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION OF THE DISK. PROTOPLANETARY DISKS MUST HAVE A VISCOSITY FAR EXCEEDING MOLECULAR VISCOSITY TO ACCRETE GAS AT THE RATES OBSERVED IN YOUNG STELLAR OBJECTS. THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE OF THIS VISCOSITY IS MAGNETIZED TURBULENCE DRIVEN BY THE MAGNETOROTATIONAL INSTABILITY (MRI) WHEREVER THE DISK IS ADEQUATELY IONIZED. MAGNETIZED TURBULENCE QUITE GENERALLY FORMS SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY INTERMITTENT CURRENT SHEETS THAT DISSIPATE THE MAGNETIC ENERGY AS HEAT. THESE CAN RAISE THE GAS TEMPERATURE LOCALLY WELL BEYOND ITS VOLUME AVERAGE.  IF TEMPERATURES REACH 1000 K, GAS RESISTIVITY STARTS TO FALL SHARPLY AS ALKALI METALS ARE THERMALLY IONIZED. OVER THE RANGE FROM 1000 K TO 2000 K, THE RESISTIVITY DECREASES BY MORE THAN 5 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. IN THAT TEMPERATURE RANGE, THE RESISTIVE EVOLUTION OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS DOMINATED BY THE SPATIAL VARIATION IN THE RESISTIVITY. SIMILARLY TO ELECTRICAL SHORT CIRCUITS AND LIGHTNING, THE ELECTRICAL CURRENTS IN THE DISK CONCENTRATE IN HOT, HIGH CONDUCTIVITY REGIONS, LEADING TO STRONG RESISTIVE HEATING IN NARROW SHEETS. WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THIS INSTABILITY CAN OCCUR IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS, EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF RADIATIVE COOLING. IN SOME CASES THE GAS IN OUR MODELS REACHES TEMPERATURES HIGH ENOUGH TO FORM CHONDRULES AND OTHER SIMILAR MINERALS.  WE PROPOSE TO FIND THE GAS AND GRAIN TEMPERATURES REACHED IN CURRENT SHEETS DRAWN DIRECTLY FROM MRI TURBULENCE. WE WILL USE LARGESCALE MODELS OF CURRENT SHEET FORMATION BY THE MRI TO SET THE STAGE FOR SMALL-SCALE MODELS OF INDIVIDUAL CURRENT SHEETS. THE MRI MODELS WILL USE THE PENCIL CODE TO CHARACTERIZE CURRENT SHEETS IN STRATIFIED, SHEARING-BOX SIMULATIONS WITHOUT TEMPERATURE DEPENDENT RESISTIVITY, AND IN HIGHER-RESOLUTION, UNSTRATIFIED SIMULATIONS WITH IT. TO IMPROVE OUR MODELING OF THE GAS RESISTIVITY AND THE MRI WE WILL USE A CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM CODE TO CALCULATE THE IONIZATION FRACTION IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS: THE ALKALI METALS CAN BE LOCKED AWAY IN SOLID MINERALS, PREVENTING THEIR THERMAL IONIZATION. TOGETHER THESE MODELS WILL PROVIDE THE INITIAL AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR SIMULATIONS OF INDIVIDUAL CURRENT SHEETS USING A PURPOSE-BUILT IMPLICIT CODE INCLUDING RADIATIVE TRANSFER AS WELL AS TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT RESISTIVITY. HISTORIES OF THE GAS TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE, AND THE AMBIENT RADIATION, SAMPLED USING LAGRANGIAN TRACER PARTICLES, WILL ALLOW US TO USE THE EQUILIBRIUM CONDENSATION CODE TO COMPARE THE EXPERIENCE OF SOLIDS IN OUR SIMULATIONS WITH EXPERIMENTAL CONSTRAINTS ON CHONDRULES AND OTHER HIGH-TEMPERATURE MINERALS. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS THAT THE SHORT CIRCUIT INSTABILITY CAN PRODUCE GRAIN THERMAL HISTORIES CONSISTENT WITH EXPERIMENTAL AND OBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE ENSEMBLE OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE MINERALS IN OUR OWN AND EXTERNAL DISKS."

THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AN OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, CALLED OPENSPACE, FOR VISUALIZING NASA ASTROPHYSICS, HELIOPHYSICS, PLANETARY SCIENCE, AND EARTH SCIENCE MISSION ENGINEERING ACTIVITIES AND SCIENCE RESULTS FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC, STUDENTS, TEACHERS, AND CITIZEN SCIENTISTS EVERYWHERE. THE  PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AND WIDELY DISSEMINATE OPENSPACE, CREATE INNOVATIVE AND NETWORKED PROGRAMS WITH ISI PARTNERS, PRODUCE EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES FOR MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS AND STUDENTS, AND ESTABLISH ROBUST PARTNERSHIPS WITH NASA SMD MISSIONS, ISIS, AND VISUALIZATION RESEARCH CENTERS.  THE PROJECT IS BASED ON THE SUCCESS OF PILOT EFFORTS TO VISUALIZE THE NEW HORIZONS MISSION AND HELIOPHYSICS AND SPACE WEATHER SIMULATION DATA GENERATED BY NASA GODDARDS COMMUNITY COORDINATED MODELING CENTER. IT BUILDS ON AMNHS EXPERTISE IN SCIENCE VISUALIZATION AND ITS RECORD OF SUCCESS IN PARTNERING WITH NASA TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE PROGRAMMING, EXHIBITIONS, AND SPACE SHOWS THAT ENGAGE, INSPIRE, AND EDUCATE STUDENTS, TEACHERS, AND LEARNERS OF ALL AGES.  DRAWING TOGETHER A HIGHLY QUALIFIED AND EXCEPTIONALLY TALENTED TEAM OF SCIENTISTS, EDUCATORS, SOFTWARE ENGINEERS, AND VISUALIZATION SPECIALISTS, THE PROJECTS AIM IS TO  BUILD A PIPELINE FOR TRANSMITTING VISUALIZED SCIENCE CONTENT FROM ACROSS NASA SMD DIVISIONS TO  ISIS, SECONDARY SCHOOL CLASSROOMS, AND THE PUBLIC.  TO DO SO, THE PROJECT PROPOSES THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES  DEVELOP OPENSPACE INTO A ROBUST AND FLEXIBLE INTERACTIVE VISUALIZATION SOFTWARE THAT SUPPORTS THE PRESENTATION OF DYNAMIC DATA SETS AND THAT IS EASILY UPDATED FOR THE PRESENTATION OF CURRENT SCIENCE.  FORM A NETWORK OF ISIS TO INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF OPENSPACE AND DEVELOP ASSOCIATED PROGRAMMING TO ENGAGE AND EDUCATE DIVERSE AUDIENCES.  DISSEMINATE OPENSPACE VIA THE WEB TO INDIVIDUAL USERS, INCLUDING TEACHERS AS A KEY AUDIENCE, WITH RESOURCES FOR LEVERAGING IT AS AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL.  PROJECT OUTCOMES INCLUDE  THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PIPELINE CONNECTING NASA SMD CONTENT AND SMES WITH ISIS, SECONDARY SCHOOL CLASSROOMS, AND THE PUBLIC.  THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW AND POWERFUL EDUCATIONAL TOOL FOR THE VISUALIZATION OF A WIDE RANGE OF NASA SMD MISSION ACTIVITIES AND DATA PRODUCTS.

BECAUSE OPENSPACE WILL BE OPEN SOURCE, IT WILL BE FREELY ACCESSIBLE TO USERS. IT IS DESIGNED TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH MULTI VIDEO CHANNEL CLUSTER OPERATIONS FOR HIGH RESOLUTION WALL DISPLAYS AND PLANETARIUM DOMES, AS WELL AS FOR SINGLE CHANNEL POLAR RENDERING FISHEYE PROJECTIONS AND FLAT  SCREENS, IN 2D AND 3D. A WEBGL VERSION WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR ANYONE WITH INTERNET ACCESS TO EXPLORE OPENSPACE. ANOTHER CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLE OF THIS PROJECT IS THE ABILITY TO NETWORK ACROSS THE INTERNET TO SYNCHRONIZE DISPLAYS IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS, CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR SHARED EXPERIENCES OF HIGH PROFILE NASA CONTENT, INCLUDING LIVE EVENTS.

STUDIES INCLUDE A COMBINATION OF ASTROPHYSICAL-COSMOCHEMICAL THEORY AND MODELING; TEXTURAL, PETROLOGICAL, AND CHEMICAL STUDIES OF METEORITES; AND LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS TO TEST CHEMICAL MODEL PREDICTIONS. PETROLOGICAL WORK WILL INCLUDE SURFACE CHEMICAL AND VOLUMETRIC 3-DIMENSIONAL CT MAPPING OF METEORITES TO ALLOW TESTS OF ASTROPHYSICAL THEORIES OF HOW CHONDRULES AND MATRIX ACCRETED INTO LARGER BODIES, AND HOW CHONDRULES MIGHT BE SIZE-SORTED. THE 3D CT WILL ALSO ALLOW DENSITY ESTIMATES OF CHONDRULE POPULATIONS. THIS IS COMPLEMENTED BY POSITION-SENSITIVE X-RAY DIFFRACTION FOR MODAL MINERAL ABUNDANCES(AT CUNY). WE WILL FOCUS ON SELECTED ORDINARY CHONDRITES (THE MOST ABUNDANT PRIMITIVE METEORITES) AND CR CHONDRITES, TO MEASURE THE ABUNDANCE AND SIZES OF THEIR MILLIMETER-SIZED CHONDRULES, AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF ELEMENTS AMONG CHONDRULES AND MATRIX. WE WILL ALSO APPLY THE SAME TOOLS TO THE VERY DIFFERENT CM CHONDRITES. THE 3D CT WILL INVOLVE STUDENT INVESTIGATORS AT FORDHAM. THIS WORK WILL INCREASE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF ASTEROID PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND CLARIFY HOW WE COULD USE CHONDRITIC BODIES AS IN SITU RESOURCES FOR SPACE EXPLORATION.  CHONDRITIC ASTEROIDS GREW FROM SMALL SOLIDS IN A GAS-RICH DISK AROUND THE EARLY SUN. WE WILL APPLY THEORY AND MODELING TO INVESTIGATE HOW GAS AND SOLID CHEMISTRY VARIED IN TIME AND SPACE AROUND THE SUN, AND HOW CHEMISTRY AFFECTED AND WAS AFFECTED BY PHYSICAL PHENOMENA SUCH AS MAGNETIC FIELDS AND DUST OPACITY. TO DO THIS, WE WILL INTEGRATE OUR CHEMICAL MODELS WITH ASTROPHYSICAL DYNAMICAL CODES TO SIMULTANEOUSLY ADDRESS DISK CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS.

TRACE ELEMENTS SUCH AS THE RARE EARTH ELEMENTS CAN PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF CONDITIONS IN THE EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM, BECAUSE THEIR PARTITIONING IS CONTROLLED BY TEMPERATURE AND OXYGEN ABUNDANCE. WE WILL INVESTIGATE TRACE ELEMENT PARTITIONING AMONG MINERALS, SILICATE LIQUIDS, AND VAPOR BOTH IN THE LAB AND BY APPLICATION OF THEORY. WE WILL MEASURE THESE DISTRIBUTIONS AMONG CHONDRITE COMPONENTS. WE WILL USE THOSE RESULTS TO INTERPRET THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF TRACE ELEMENTS AMONG COMPONENTS IN A RANGE OF CHONDRITE TYPES, TO TEST ASTROPHYSICALCOSMOCHEMICAL HYPOTHESES FOR THE ORIGINS OF COMPONENTS AND THEIR ACCRETION.

ANALYSIS OF WHOLE COMET GRAIN TRACKS IN  AEROGEL WILL BE USED TO INFER THE ORIGINAL PROPERTIES OF GRAINS BEFORE THEIR 6.1 KM SEC IMPACT INTO THE AEROGEL CAPTURE MEDIUM USED BY THE STARDUST MISSION. WE HAVE DEVELOPED EXPERTISE IN USING A LASER SCANNING CONFOCAL MICROSCOPE LCSM TO OBTAIN HIGH RESOLUTION 74 NM BY 74 NM X AND Y BY 370 NM ON OPTIC AXIS Z RESOLUTION 3D IMAGES, IN MULTIPLE WAVELENGTHS, OF PARTICLE TRACKS IN KEYSTONES CUT FROM THE AEROGEL CAPTURE TILES. WE HAVE GREATLY IMPROVED OUR ABILITY TO BETTER RESOLVE INDIVIDUAL FEATURES IN PARTICLE TRACKS BY IMPROVING DECONVOLUTION TECHNIQUE TO REMOVE DISTORTIONS WHICH ARE INHERENT IN THIS KIND OF OPTICAL MICROSCOPY.

OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE EXTREMELY DETAILED 3D INFORMATION ON GRAIN LOCATIONS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS GOAL. A FURTHER GOAL IS TO DEVELOP OUR ABILITY TO MODEL THE PHYSICS OF HYPERVELOCITY IMPACTS INTO AEROGEL SO THAT THE ORIGINAL PROPERTIES MASS, POROSITY OF IMPACTING COMETARY PARTICLES MIGHT BE INFERRED. WE HAVE OBTAINED THE HYDRODYNAMIC CODES CTH AND ISALE, AND WE WILL WORK WITH COLLABORATOR GROUP TO DEVELOP AN EQUATION OF STATE FOR SILICA AEROGEL.

THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED USING A TWO-PRONGED APPROACH ADDRESSING BOTH DEVICE DESIGN AND MATERIALS. FIRST, THE CONVENTIONAL PN PHOTODIODE DEVICE IS REPLACED WITH A NEW DEVICE STRUCTURE, THE NBN DETECTOR, WHICH INHERENTLY SUPPRESSES PERFORMANCE-LIMITING DARK CURRENTS, SUCH AS THOSE PRODUCED BY SURFACE LEAKAGE. SECOND, HIGHLY MANUFACTURABLE III-V MATERIALS ARE USED, WHICH ARE FURTHER ENHANCED WITH AMETHYST''S PROPRIETARY UV HYDROGENATION DEFECT MITIGATION PROCESS. THE RESULT IS A LOW COST, HIGH PERFORMANCE DETECTORS OPERATING IN THE 2   5 MICRON WAVELENGTH REGION. THERE IS A PRESSING NEED FOR ULTRA-HIGH SENSITIVITY DETECTORS OPERATING IN THIS REGION FOR THE DETECTION OF TRACE GASES AND CHEMICALS. IN PHASE I AMETHYST PRODUCED A 2.8 MICRON CUTOFF DETECTOR. THE PROGRAM MET ALL OBJECTIVES, DEMONSTRATING CONSIDERABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN PERFORMANCE OVER CONVENTIONAL PN DIODES USING THE NBN AND HYDROGENATION APPROACH. IN PHASE II, AMETHYST WILL DESIGN, FABRICATE AND TEST HIGH PERFORMANCE DETECTORS INDIVIDUALLY OPTIMIZED WITH CUTOFF WAVELENGTHS THROUGHOUT 2 5 MICRON WAVELENGTH RANGE. THESE DETECTORS WILL HAVE IMPROVED DETECTIVITY, AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED COOLING REQUIREMENTS COMPARED TO CURRENTLY AVAILABLE COMMERCIAL DETECTORS. IN ADDITION, AMETHYST WILL DELIVER A THERMOELECTRICALLY COOLED 3.3 MICRON WAVELENGTH CUTOFF DETECTOR TO JPL''S MICRODEVICES LABORATORY FOR COMPARATIVE TESTING AND TO ASSIST IN DEVELOPMENT OF METHANE DETECTOR SYSTEMS. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE II IS TO ESTABLISH PERFORMANCE METRICS, MANUFACTURING PROCESS, CHARACTERIZE AND LIFE TEST SINGLE ELEMENT DEVICES. THESE EFFORTS WILL HELP ESTABLISH A US BASED MANUFACTURING SOURCE OF THESE ULTRA-HIGH PERFORMANCE DETECTORS."

IN THIS SBIR PROGRAM, AMETHYST RESEARCH WILL DEVELOP A NON-DISPERSIVE INFRARED (NDIR) GAS SENSOR THAT IS CAPABLE OF MEASURING MULTIPLE GASES WITH ABSORPTION IN THE MID TO FAR INFRARED SPECTRA WITH HIGH ACCURACY. THE ENVISIONED SYSTEM WILL BE COMPACT, LIGHT WEIGHT AND OPERATE AT LOW POWER WITH DETECTION DISCRIMINATION IN THE PPB RANGE. THE SYSTEM\'S PERFORMANCE IS MADE POSSIBLE BY AMETHYST\'S RECENTLY DEVELOPED HIGH SENSITIVITY NARROW BAND INFRARED DETECTOR THAT CAN BE TUNED TO DETECT ONLY LIGHT IN THE ABSORPTION BAND OF THE INDIVIDUAL GAS.

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF RECENT MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION AND GEODETIC ACCURACY OF LUNAR TOPOGRAPHIC DATA AS A BASIS FOR CALCULATIONS TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE SELENOLOCATION OF THE M3 DATA. ROOT-MEAN-SQUARED (RMS) POSITIONAL ERRORS WILL BE REDUCED FROM #tilde#200 M RELATIVE AND 450 M ABSOLUTE TO ON THE ORDER OF A PIXEL (140 M) OR BETTER, AND THE NUMEROUS IMAGES WITH GROSS POSITIONAL ERRORS OF KILOMETERS WILL BE CORRECTED. SECONDARILY, SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC ACCURACY WILL BE IMPROVED THROUGH THE USE OF A MUCH MORE DETAILED TOPOGRAPHIC MODEL IN PHOTOMETRIC CORRECTIONS AND MORE ACCURATE REGISTRATION TO THIS MODEL. TWO DATASETS WILL BE USED: (1) DIGITAL DATA FROM THE M3 PDS ARCHIVE, INCLUDING HYPERSPECTRAL DATA FROM TWO MAJOR OPTICAL IMAGING PERIODS, ANCILLARY DATA INCLUDING SPICE KERNELS, SELENOLOCATION FILES, AND ENGINEERING DATA SUFFICIENT TO REPRODUCE AND IMPROVE UPON EARLIER RAY-TRACING RESULTS (BOARDMAN ET AL., 2011; GREEN ET AL., 2011); AND (2) THE FULL-RESOLUTION (#tilde#100 M/PIXEL) DIGITAL TERRAIN MODEL (DTM) DERIVED FROM STEREO IMAGING OF THE WIDE ANGLE CAMERA (WAC) INSTRUMENT ON THE LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (E.G., SCHOLTEN ET AL., 2011). THE WORK CONSISTS OF FIVE MAJOR TASKS: (1) SYSTEMATIC REPROCESSING OF THE FULL DATASET THROUGH THE MISSION-DEVELOPED LEVEL 1B PROCESSING PIPELINE USING THE WAC DTM TO GREATLY IMPROVE SELENOLOCATION ACCURACY; (2) DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE TOOLS FOR PROCESSING M3 DATA ''MOST IMPORTANTLY, A PHYSICALLY RIGOROUS CAMERA MODEL'' IN THE USGS ISIS3; (3) USE OF THE ADVANCED CAPABILITIES OF ISIS TO CONTROL THE GLOBAL M3 DATASET WITH IMPROVED ACCURACY AND GENERATE FURTHER IMPROVED LEVEL 1B PRODUCTS; (4) SYSTEMATIC REPROCESSING OF BEST VERSION OF LEVEL 1B DATA THROUGH THE MISSION DEVELOPED LEVEL 2 PROCESSING PIPELINE USING THE WAC DTM TO GREATLY IMPROVE PHOTOMETRIC ACCURACY; (5) GENERATION OF A COMPLETE SET OF ORTHORECTIFIED AND MOSAICKED (LEVEL 3) DATA PRODUCTS INCLUDING PHOTOMETRICALLY NORMALIZED SPECTRA AND SPECTRAL PARAMETER MAPS; AND (6) DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS, WITH INTERIM RESULTS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE ONLINE AND FINAL SPICE KERNELS, LEVEL 1B AND LEVEL 3 PRODUCTS FORMALLY ARCHIVED TO THE IMAGING NODE OF THE PLANETARY DATA SYSTEM (PDS). THE MULTIPLE PRODUCTS GENERATED BY THIS EFFORT WILL SERVE THE BROADEST POSSIBLE SET OF SCIENTIFIC APPLICATIONS OF THE M3 DATASET. LEVEL 1B PRODUCTS, WHICH ARE NOT SPATIALLY RESAMPLED, ARE ESSENTIAL OR STUDIES REQUIRING THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE SPECTRAL FIDELITY, AND THE IMPROVED SELENOLOCATION ACCURACY OF OUR RESULTS WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PHOTOMETRIC NORMALIZATION OF THESE DATA AND FACILITATE COMPARISON WITH OTHER DATASETS. THE RESAMPLED LEVEL 3 PRODUCTS WILL GREATLY SIMPLIFY THE USE OF M3 FOR REGIONAL STUDIES IN WHICH SUMMARY SPECTRAL CHARACTERISTICS SUFFICE. FINALLY, THE COMBINATION OF A FULL SET OF ISIS TOOLS PLUS IMPROVED SPICE DATA WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR USERS WHOSE SPECIAL NEEDS ARE NOT MET BY EITHER OF THESE PRODUCT SETS TO DO THEIR OWN M3 PROCESSING."

THE CONTINUATION IS ACHIEVED THROUGH ESTABLISHING HOMOTOPIES BETWEEN SOME SIMPLE MODELS, FOR WHICH SOLUTIONS ARE EASY TO OBTAIN, AND THE FULL MODELS. WE WILL INVESTIGATE HOW SENSITIVITIES OF THE TRAJECTORY TO THE HOMOTOPY PARAMETERS CAN BE USED TO SYSTEMATICALLY AND EFFECTIVELY AUTOMATE THE HOMOTOPY CONTINUATION, IMPROVING THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE ALGORITHMS. WE WILL ALSO INVESTIGATE ADAPTIVE FIDELITY MODELS AND ALTERNATIVE INTERPOLATION-BASED GRAVITY MODELS, AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED BY THE INVESTIGATORS TO SPEED UP THE DYNAMICS EVALUATIONS. ALMOST EVERY LEGACY TRAJECTORY DESIGN SOFTWARE CODE USED BY NASA (E.G., MALTO, COPERNICUS, EMTG, GMAT, ETC.) IS FACED BY THE DILEMMA THAT HARD PROBLEMS SIMPLY DON\'T CONVERGE WITHOUT A GOOD INITIAL GUESS. THE GRADIENT-BASED LOCALIZED OPTIMIZATION METHODS USED IN THESE SOFTWARE TOOLS REQUIRE INITIAL GUESSES THAT ARE CLOSE TO THE FINAL SOLUTIONS. THE COMMON PRACTICE OF USING SOLUTIONS BASED ON SIMPLIFIED MODELS AS INITIAL GUESSES OFTEN DO NOT YIELD CONVERGENCE IF THE FULL PROBLEM IS SOLVED DIRECTLY, ESPECIALLY IN HIGHLY PERTURBED DYNAMICAL ENVIRONMENTS. IN THE PROPOSED METHOD, INSTEAD OF TAKING A FULL STEP FROM THE SIMPLE MODEL TO THE FULL MODEL, WE SYSTEMATICALLY TAKE SMALLER STEPS, AND JUDICIOUSLY INTRODUCE INCREMENTAL PERTURBATIONS. THIS METHOD IS AMENABLE TO AUTOMATION AND YIELDS ROBUSTNESS IN CONVERGENCE. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL GREATLY BENEFIT NASA AND THE SPACE TRAJECTORY DESIGN COMMUNITY IN DESIGNING HIGH-FIDELITY TRAJECTORIES WITH TRUE EPHEMERIDES AND FORCE FIELDS."

THE SIMULATIONS CAN HELP IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE UNEXPECTED LOSSES OCCUR. MORE IMPORTANT TO THE OPERATION AND SAFETY OF THE TUNNEL, THE SIMULATIONS CAN ALSO PROVIDE A BETTER ESTIMATE OF THE AERODYNAMIC LOADS ON THE TUNNEL STRUCTURE AND SUPPORT HARDWARE, AND PROVIDE BETTER DESIGNS OF FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TUNNEL CIRCUIT. MOST WIND TUNNEL FACILITIES TODAY ARE DESIGNED USING EITHER EMPIRICAL METHODS OR IDEALIZED LUMPED-PARAMETER MODELS OF THE TUNNEL CIRCUIT. THEY ARE TYPICALLY SUPPORTED WITH TESTING OF SECTIONS OF THE CIRCUIT USING SMALL-SCALE MODELS WHEN THE COMPLEXITY OF A PARTICULAR PART OF THE CIRCUIT EXCEEDS THE EMPIRICAL MODELS. WHEN THE FACILITY BECOMES VERY COMPLEX OR REPRESENTS A NEW GENERATION OF TESTING CAPABILITIES THE NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS CAN PROVIDE BETTER AND SAFER DESIGNS. THE SIMULATIONS CAN ALSO PROVIDE DATA TO IMPROVE WALL CORRECTIONS FOR WIND TUNNEL MODELS THAT TAX THE EXISTING CAPABILITIES. THE NATIONAL TRANSONIC FACILITY (NTF) IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND HIGH REYNOLDS NUMBER CRYOGENIC TRANSONIC WIND TUNNEL. THE NTF IS A FAN-DRIVEN, CLOSED CIRCUIT, CONTINUOUS-FLOW, AND PRESSURIZED WIND TUNNEL. IT IS ONE OF ONLY TWO HIGH REYNOLDS NUMBER TRANSONIC FACILITIES THAT CAN MATCH THE FULL FLIGHT REYNOLDS NUMBERS OF MANY OF TODAY S COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. IT CAN OPERATE IN DRY AIR AT WARM TEMPERATURES OR IN NITROGEN GAS FROM WARM TO CRYOGENIC TEMPERATURES. THE TEST SECTION IS 8.2 X 8.2 FT. IN CROSS SECTION AND 25 FT. IN LENGTH. THE TEST SECTION FLOOR AND CEILING ARE SLOTTED (6 PERCENT OPEN) AND THE SIDEWALLS ARE SOLID. THE NTF IS CAPABLE OF AN ABSOLUTE PRESSURE RANGE OF 15 PSI TO 125 PSI, A TEMPERATURE RANGE FROM -320 F TO 150 F, AN MACH NUMBER RANGE FROM 0.2 TO 1.2, AND A MAXIMUM REYNOLDS NUMBER OF 146X106 AT MACH 1.

THE STARTING POINT FOR THIS WORK WILL BE THE GOVERNMENT SUPPLIED IGES CAD SURFACES DEVELOPED FROM THE LASER-BASED POINT-CLOUD SCANS OF THE FACILITY ALTHOUGH ADDITIONAL MODELING OF STRUCTURE MAY BE REQUIRED BEYOND WHAT WILL BE PROVIDED DEPENDING ON DETERMINED IMPACT. TO GET TO THIS POINT, WORKING WITH THE NASA RESEARCHERS AT THE NTF AND GEOLAB TO DEVELOP THE MODELED SURFACES USING A COMBINATION OF POINT-CLOUD DATA AND ARCHITECTURAL OR STRUCTURAL DRAWINGS MAY BE REQUIRED.

STELLAR ROTATION COUPLED WITH CONVECTIVE MOTIONS GIVE RISE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS. HIGH PRECISION SPECTROSCOPY AND PHOTOMETRY MEASUREMENTS HAVE DETECTED CYCLES IN THE MAGNETIC ACTIVITY OF STARS SIMILAR TO THE 11 YEAR SOLAR CYCLE. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DISCOVER CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT GOVERN STELLAR CYCLE DYNAMICS UTILIZING SPECTROSCOPY AND PHOTOMETRY MEASUREMENTS FROM SUN-LIKE STARS. IN PARTICULAR, OUR INVESTIGATION WILL RELATE BASIC OBSERVABLES, SUCH AS MASS, METALLICITY, RADIUS, ROTATION RATE, DEPTH OF CONVECTION ZONE, AND DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION RATES WITH TOTAL SOLAR IRRADIANCE AND STARSPOT PROPERTIES INCLUDING: TOTAL SPOTTEDNESS AND SWITCHING OF DOMINANT ACTIVITY BETWEEN LONGITUDES (FLIP-FLOP CYCLES). WE WILL FOCUS ON DETERMINING WHICH FACTORS CONTROL THE PERIODICITY OF STARSPOTS, HOW STELLAR CYCLES EVOLVE WITH THE AGE OF STARS, AND WHICH FACTORS DETERMINE DEEP GLOBAL MINIMA IN STELLAR CYCLE DYNAMICS. METHODOLOGY: WE WILL UTILIZE A SET OF INFORMATION-THEORETICAL TOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN RECENTLY DEVELOPED TO EXAMINE CAUSE AND EFFECT RELATIONSHIPS IN OBSERVATIONAL DATASETS. TRANSFER ENTROPY AND MUTUAL REDUNDANCY ARE ENTROPY-BASED MEASURES OF DEPENDENCY (E.G. MUTUAL INFORMATION) THAT ARE BASED ON CONDITIONAL PROBABILITIES AND CAN BE USED TO MEASURE THE DIRECTED INFORMATION TRANSFER BETWEEN TWO VARIABLES. THE CONDITIONAL REDUNDANCY WILL BE USED TO SYSTEMATICALLY ISOLATE CONTROLLING VARIABLES FROM A SET OF INPUT MEASUREMENTS. ONCE CAUSAL VARIABLES ARE IDENTIFIED, WE WILL CONSTRUCT COUPLING FUNCTIONS TO DESCRIBE THE DEPENDENCE OF STELLAR CYCLE DYNAMICS ON THE CAUSAL VARIABLES USING THE PRINCIPLE OF MAXIMIZATION OF INFORMATION. PROPOSED CONTRIBUTION TO THE FOCUS TEAM EFFORT AND RELEVANCE TO NASA: THIS INVESTIGATION WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE FOCUS TEAM EFFORT 3.1.2 \THE SOLAR-STELLAR CONNECTION.\"" THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUES WILL BE USED TO IDENTIFY PROCESSES (VARIABLES) THAT CONTROL TOTAL SOLAR IRRADIANCE AND STARSPOT CYCLES, INCLUDING PERIODICITY AND DEEP GLOBAL MINIMA, AND TO CONSTRUCT NONLINEAR MAPS THAT CAPTURE THE ACTIVITY CYCLE DYNAMICS AND HAVE PREDICTIVE VALUE. THE PROPOSED PROJECT RELIES HEAVILY ON COLLABORATIONS WITH OBSERVERS AND MODELERS ON THE LWS TEAM. OUR PLAN IS TO WORK WITH OBSERVERS ON THE TEAM TO COMPILE A DATABASE OF VARIABLES THAT CHARACTERIZE THE MAGNETIC ACTIVITY CYCLE DYNAMICS AND TO IDENTIFY CAUSAL VARIABLES THAT CONTROL THE DYNAMICS. WE WILL WORK WITH TEAM MODELERS TO EVALUATE THE OUTPUT FROM PREDICTIVE MODELS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ADEQUATELY CAPTURE THE SYSTEM DYNAMICS, AND WE WILL USE THE PRINCIPLE OF MAXIMIZATION OF INFORMATION TO CONSTRUCT PREDICTIVE MODELS FOR STARSPOT DYNAMICS.

WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP SENSOR MODULES TO GATHER AND CONDITION SIGNALS INCLUDING HEAT FLUX, ACOUSTICS AND ELECTRIC FIELDS TO COMPLIMENT EXISTING TEMPERATURE, PRESSURE AND STRAIN MEASUREMENT HARDWARE. COMMUNICATIONS MODULES WILL TRANSMIT SENSOR DATA VIA HIGH-FREQUENCY, HIGH-BANDWIDTH, LOW-POWER NETWORK TECHNOLOGIES. POWER MODULES WILL SUPPLY POWER TO THE NODE THROUGH THE USE OF BATTERY, SOLAR OR SCAVENGED POWER. PHASE I PROTOTYPE SYSTEM NODES WILL BE SMALLER THAN 5 CUBIC CENTIMETERS (CC), AND AFTER MINIATURIZATION, NODES WILL LIKELY BE SMALLER THAN 0.5 CC. ADDITIONALLY, RADIATION HARD VERSIONS OF MANY OF THE COMPONENTS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR POSSIBLE FLIGHT MISSIONS. A CENTRAL PROCESSING GATEWAY RECEIVES DATA FROM THE SENSOR NETWORK, PROVIDES REAL-TIME PROCESSING OF THE DATA AND REPORTS RAW AND PROCESSED DATA TO TEST ENGINEERS AND SOFTWARE VIA STANDARD NETWORK INTERFACES. RESEARCH PARTNER, THE PENNATHUR LAB AT UCSB, ADDS EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITY IN ADVANCED POWER HARVESTING, MICRO- AND NANOFLUIDIC BASED SENSORS."

A COUNTRY S NFMS SHOULD ALSO BE USED FOR DATA COLLECTION TO INFORM THE ASSESSMENT OF NATIONAL OR SUBNATIONALFOREST REFERENCE EMISSION LEVELS AND/OR FOREST REFERENCE LEVELS (RELS/RLS). IN THIS WAY, THE NFMS FORMS THE LINK BETWEEN HISTORICAL ASSESSMENTS AND CURRENT/FUTURE ASSESSMENTS, ENABLING CONSISTENCY IN THE DATA AND INFORMATION TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REDD+ ACTIVITIES IN COUNTRIES. THE CREATION OF A RELIABLE, TRANSPARENT, AND COMPREHENSIVE NFMS IS CURRENTLY LIMITED BY A DEARTH OF RELEVANT DATA THAT ARE ACCURATE, LOW-COST, AND SPATIALLY RESOLVED AT SUBNATIONAL SCALES.

KALIMANTAN IS AN IDEAL AREA TO EVALUATE THE USE OF REMOTE SENSING METHODS BECAUSE MEASURING FORESTCARBON STOCKS AND THEIR HUMAN CAUSED CHANGES WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF CERTAINTY IN AREAS OF DENSE TROPICAL FORESTS HAS PROVEN TO BE DIFFICULT. WHILE THE PROPOSED NFMS COMPONENTS WILL BE DEVELOPED AT THE SUBNATIONAL SCALE FOR KALIMANTAN, WE WILL TARGET THESE METHODS FOR APPLICABILITY ACROSS BROADER GEOGRAPHIES AND FOR IMPLEMENTATION AT VARIOUS SCALES. THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL ADVANCE THE STATE OF THE ART OF MEASURING, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION (MRV) SYSTEM METHODOLOGIES IN WAYS THAT ARE BOTH TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL. FIRST, BECAUSE A PRIMARY FOCUS OF CARBON MONITORING SYSTEMS, ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, IS ON COST-EFFECTIVENESS, OUR ANALYSIS OF OPTIMAL INPUTS OF INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS SATELLITE, AIRBORNE, AND IN SITU MEASUREMENTS WILL PROVIDE VALUABLE PRACTICAL INFORMATION THAT COUNTRIES CAN USE TO CONSIDER THE TRADEOFFS. SECOND, BECAUSE QUANTIFYING AND UNDERSTANDING UNCERTAINTY IS CRITICAL BOTH IN AN EARTH SCIENCE RESEARCH CONTEXT AND WITH REGARD TO PAYMENT FOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, OUR DEVELOPMENT OF REUSABLE METHODS FOR TRACKING AND EVALUATING UNCERTAINTY WITHIN A CARBON MONITORING SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR STAKEHOLDERS AND RESEARCHERS TO UNDERSTAND AND MINIMIZE ERRORS ACROSS MRV COMPONENTS.

WHEN THE PROBE IS INTEGRATED WITH A PRECISION MOTION, X, Y,&Z METROLOGY FRAME (PHASE II) (SEE FIGURE?1), IT WILL MEET NASA\'S NEED TO MEASURE FREE-FORM OPTICAL SURFACES FROM 0.5 CM TO 6 CM DIAMETER RANGING FROM F/2 TO F/20, INCLUDING SLOPES UP TO 20 DEGREES (WITH POTENTIAL FOR 60 DEGREES), WITH AN UNCERTAINTY TARGETED AT 2?NM RMS. THE PROBE OPERATION DOES NOT REQUIRE TILTING TO MEASURE SLOPES. THIS RESULTS IN THIS SIMPLIFIED CARTESIAN METROLOGY FRAME, ALSO CRITICAL TO ACHIEVE 2 NANOMETER MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTY. THESE FEATURES: NANOMETER RESOLUTION AND 20 DEGREE SLOPE ACCEPTANCE ANGLE, HAVE UP TO THIS TIME NOT BEEN FOUND IN A SINGLE PROBE OR SENSOR, NON-CONTACT OR CONTACT.

THE AQUARIUM AND ITS PARTNERS, THE OREGON MUSEUM OF SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY (OMSI) AND GODDARD FAMILY VISITOR CENTER (GODDARD), DRAW UPON THE EXPERTISE OF NASA (AND JPL UPON AWARD) AND OTHER SCIENTISTS AND EXPERTS TO HELP DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT THE EI NINO STORY AS DEPICTED BY EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS (EOS). THE PROJECT FOCUSES ON NASA-IDENTIFIED ISSUES OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND MONITORING ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS TO ENGAGE THE AUDIENCE IN THE POWER AND PURPOSE OF EARTH INFORMATION AND DATA-GATHERING TOOLS TO INFORM US ABOUT, AND FORECAST, EARTH SYSTEMS EVENTS. AUDIENCES INCLUDE OVER TWO MILLION VISITORS TO THE PARTNER INSTITUTIONS; URBAN AND RURAL CONSTITUENCIES THAT RANK AMONG THE MOST DIVERSE IN THE NATION. THE PROJECT ALSO TARGETS UNDERSERVED YOUTH TO PROMOTE STEM LEARNING AND INCREASE INTEREST IN STEM CAREERS THROUGH EXPERIENCES OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM, IN AN INFORMAL SETTING. TO REACH THOSE STUDENTS, TEACHERS WILL BE OFFERED A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WORKSHOP (WITH STIPEND) IN WHICH THEY CAN ROLE PLAYAS SCIENTISTS GATHERING AND ANALYZING DATA FROM THE VARIOUS MONITORING INSTRUMENTS, AND LEARN HOW THE SOS EXHIBIT WORKS; THESE WILL BE NEW TOOLS THEY CAN UTILIZE TO ENGAGE THEIR STUDENTS. RURAL OREGON LIBRARIES REACH 7,000 PEOPLE EACH YEAR, AND WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE SOS PROGRAM TRANSLATED ONTO A SMALL TRANSPORTABLE GLOBE DISPLAY CALLED THE MAGIC PLANET. THE PROJECT USES PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATIONS WITH EXPERTS TO CREATE SCIENTIFIC CONTENT AND AN ACCESSIBLE SET OF PROJECT DELIVERABLES FOR DIVERSE AUDIENCES. ADVANCED TECHNICAL INFORMATION IS HUMANIZED THROUGH SHOWING LOCAL EI NINO EVENTS (SOS PRODUCTION), AND THROUGH DIRECT CONTACT WITH SCIENTISTS WORKING ON NASA-FUNDED RESEARCH (NASA NIGHT). A PLANNED FOUR-PRONGED APPROACH WILL REACH LEARNERS WITH THE MISSIONS OF NASA AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SCIENCE KNOWLEDGE NOW AND IN THE FUTURE: (1) ENGAGE AUDIENCES WITH THE SOS PRODUCTION, IN WHICH LARGE MOVING IMAGES OF EARTH SYSTEMS ARE PROJECTED ONTO A ROOM-SIZED GLOBE, AND LOCAL IMPACTS (AND BI-LINGUAL SUBTITLES) ARE SHOWN ON FIAT SCREEN DISPLAYS ABOVE IT; (2) REACH TEACHERS FROM UNDERSERVED SCHOOLS WITH THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WORKSHOPS; (3) INVOLVE TEACHERS, STUDENTS AND FAMILIES IN A SPECIAL INFORMAL EDUCATION EVENT CALLED NASA NIGHT AT THE AQUARIUM, WHERE SCIENTISTS ARE AVAILABLE TO TALK ABOUT STEM EDUCATION, CAREERS, AND VALUE; AND (4) MAINTAIN INTEREST THROUGH RELATED FOLLOW-ON ACTIVITIES ACCESSIBLE ON THE WEB, VIA MOBILE APPLICATIONS, AND BY TOURING THE MAGIC PLANET VERSION.

BASED ON INITIAL VEHICLE ARCHITECTURE OPTIMIZATION ANALYSIS COMPLETED BY ENGINEERS AT ARCTIC SLOPE TECHNICAL SERVICES (ASTS), THE ACCELERATION LIMIT PLACES A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE GRAIN PROFILES USED ON BOTH THE FIRST AND SECOND STAGE ROCKET MOTORS. THEREFORE, THE USE OF A DUAL PULSE ROCKET MOTOR GRAIN DESIGN ENABLES THE USE OF TWO SUBSEQUENT PULSES THAT ARE IGNITED SO AS TO MIMIC A SINGLE GRAIN ALONG THE OPTIMAL THRUST PROFILE. THIS SOLUTION BURNS DOWN THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH AN END BURNING GRAIN DESIGN. THE DUAL PULSE GRAIN DESIGN LEVERAGES FINOCYL DESIGNS THAT OFFERS SIGNIFICANT GRAIN STRESS RELIEF BECAUSE OF THE FINS.

ADVANCING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE LUNAR INTERIOR REQUIRES A NEW LUNAR SEISMIC DATASET, BOTH AS PART OF THE INTERNATIONAL LUNAR NETWORK, AS WELL AS FUTURE ROBOTIC AND HUMAN LUNAR MISSIONS. FOUR CRITICAL ISSUES CAN BE ADDRESSED WITH A NEW LUNAR SEISMIC NETWORK: 1)SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF LUNAR BOLIDE IMPACTS AND THEIR POTENTIAL HAZARD FOR HUMANS; 2)DISTRIBUTION OF SHALLOW MOONQUAKES, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL FOR LARGE (MAG>=4.0) EVENTS NEAR HABITATION SITES; 3)SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF DEEP MOONQUAKE NESTS; AND 4)THE STRUCTURE, COMPOSITION, AND STATE OF THE MOON''S INTERIOR, INCLUDING THE NATURE OF THE CORE.

HOWEVER, THE LUNAR ENVIRONMENT IS HARSHER IN TERMS OF TEMPERATURE RANGE, RADIATION DOSAGE, AND DEPLOYMENT FORCE IMPACT, MAKING LUNAR SEISMOMETER DESIGN MORE CHALLENGING. FURTHERMORE, APOLLO SEISMIC DATA DISPLAYED HIGH AMPLITUDE RINGING OF SEISMIC ENERGY THAT PERSISTS FOLLOWING THE FIRST ARRIVAL (\CODA\""), PRECLUDING CONFIDENT ANALYSIS OF DISTINCT SEISMIC PHASES THAT ARRIVE CLOSE IN TIME TO THE FIRST ARRIVAL.

TARGET SPECIFICATIONS OF OUR SINGLE SEISMOMETERS ARE: RESOLUTION OF 10^-10M/S^2/HZ^1/2 (10^-11M/S^2/HZ^1/2 IN SALSA CONFIGURATION); BANDWIDTH OF 0.001HZ TO 20HZ; DYNAMIC RANGE OF 145DB; MAXIMUM SHOCK LOAD OF 12,000G; VIBRATION LOAD OF 100G; SINGLE 3-AXIAL SEISMOMETER: SIZE OF 32MM X 32MM X 32MM (LXWXH), MASS OF 15GRAMS; POWER CONSUMPTION OF 100MW; AND TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVEL OF 5.

This is a critical concern, since a) tbe immune system of the crew is dysfunctional during spaceflight, b) spaceflight uniquely increases the virulence and globally alters gene expression of the human pathogen Salmonella typhimurium when the bacteria are recovered post-flight and subsequently used to infect ground-based animal models, c) spaceflight-induced increases in S. typhlmurium virulence are regulated by media ion composition, d) phosphate ion is sufficient to alter related pathogenesis responses In a ground-based spaceflight analogue model, and e) the evolutionarily conserved bacterial RNA chaperone protein, Hfq, serves as a master molecular regulator of many of these responses. While spaceflight has been shown to induce changes that can independently affect the host or the pathogen in a manner that is directly relevant to the development of infectious disease during spacefligbt - none of these studies have been done when both the host and pathogen are simultaneously exposed to the spaceflight environment. To address this knowledge gap, we propose to challenge the human surrogate model Caenorhabditis elegans with S. typhimurium during spaceflight to study the role of the intestine in host-pathogen interactions in real-time, define virulence mechanisms, identify evolutionarily conserved responses, and test novel therapeutic strategies to prevent infectious disease. We hypothesize tbat the combination of a spacefligbt-induced increase in virulence of the pathogen coupled with a blunted immune response of the host will result in a synergistic effect on tbe host-pathogen interactions such that the risk of infectious disease during spaceflight is exacerbated. We further propose that tbese responses represent evolutionarily conserved mechanisms at the level of both bost and pathogen that are dependent media ion composition, specifically the local concentration of phosphate."

For the NASA-ESA Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) and particularly the Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO), autonomous science enhancement is crucial to finding evidence of current or recent geophysical activity on Europa. Algorithms for onboard detection of events and surface features that indicate activity, such as thermal anomalies and active plumes, can be matured from existing software for application to Europa. Those algorithms can be tested using currently available data sets and the test results can be analyzed in order to form recommendations for mission concepts. The objectives of this research are to (1) develop onboard decision-making software that will greatly enhance the Europa Flagship mission as well as other potential future planetary missions by (2) developing methods by which software can detect and identify a broad range of science events and phenomena that can be autonomously prioritized for data downlink and/or other spacecraft operations; development of this software and associated hardware and operations concepts will require (3) testing datasets with currently available platforms. This research will focus on finding methods of characterizing surface features and identifying sites of activity. Existing algorithms for autonomous science enhancement developed by Chien et al. at JPL will be adapted for use with the instruments planned for the JEO; they will be modified for characterization and classification of surface features, detection of thermal signatures, and identification of plumes. These algorithms will also include methods for change detection to enable efficient detection of science phenomena such as surface or near surface change on Europa. This will be completed by analyzing current methods of automated feature or change detection and testing similar methods on currently active platforms. Work will include enhancing existing onboard response capabilities such that the software can be applied directly to Europa mission conditions."

The study of CR2 diastereomer amino acids also allowed the inference of an original asymmetry in their precursor aldehydes. In light of the uniqueness and clear prebiotic implications of these findings, studies are proposed towards gaining a fuller understanding of CR2 chiral and molecular composition as well as assessing prebiotically realistic pathways of early Earth evolution for selected amino acids of meteoritic distribution. Extend the search for possible enantiomeric excesses to CR2 hydroxy- and monocarboxylic acids that, like amino acids, might have formed from aldehyde precursors. Search CR2 extracts for N-containing compounds of prebiotic significance (HCN, formamide, urea, peptides) that have not yet been identified but could be abundant in these meteorites. Assess the possible formation of small peptides from standard amino acid pools of CR2 and CR2/CM2 mixed composition under prebiotic settings. Continue the study of the chiral interactions between sugars and amino acids in a water-based prebiotic model. Methodologies developed through the years in our laboratory will allow a ready chiral investigation of hydoxy-, monocarboxylic acids. Methodologies for the analyses of other compounds and model experiments will be developed, following literature and preliminary experimental findings. These studies will broaden our understanding of cosmochemical samples with unique prebiotic potential, address anew the basic exobiological question of whether extraterrestrial organic compounds contributed to terrestrial molecular evolution and will provide relevant data on how this evolution might have proceeded upon delivery to the early Earth of organic materials with CR or CR/CM mixed-compositions."

The quantification of history"" requires precise and accurate dating of impact events. Noble gas geochronology of melted or shocked target rocks is historically one of the most successful approaches to dating impacts, but the most advanced techniques developed since the Apollo era for terrestrial Ar and He geochronology are not commonly applied to extraterrestrial samples. For example, state-of-the-art 40Ar/39Ar geochronology of frictional melts associated with major fault zones (pseudotachylites) typically employs the extremely high spatial resolution of ultraviolet (UV) laser microprobes to selectively ablate and analyze glassy or recrystallized domains in polished petrographic thin sections while avoiding contamination by older xenolithic or xenocrystic materials. Since many of the scientific challenges involved in geochronologic studies of impact melts are identical to those involved in geochronologic studies of impact melts, we propose to evaluate the utility of 40Ar/39Ar UV laser microprobe dating of lunar impact melts through two studies. The first involves using this technique to date materials from the Mistastin Lake Impact Crater, northern Labrador. Target rocks of the ca. 36 Ma Mistastin Lake impact are intermediate to mafic igneous rocks (primarily anorthosites, hypersthene monzonites, and granodiorites), such that studies in and around this crater provide a unique opportunity to study impact melts and breccias that are among the best lithologic analogues on Earth for samples that may be encountered in future explorations of impact sites on the Moon (such as South Pole-Aitken). More importantly for our purposes, the Mistastin Lake impactites are simple by comparison to lunar impactites, which record a complex history of multiple impact events. In the more ambitious second study, we will move on to the more difficult problem of dating polyphase Apollo 17 impact breccias by 40Ar/39Ar UV laser microprobe, with an eye toward comparing the results to previous impact chronologies developed through conventional 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb ion microprobe work by other research teams and hopefully expanding our knowledge of the impact record in the Taurus-Littrow valley. In this way, we will determine whether or not the higher spatial resolution of UV laser microprobe studies add extra value to impact chronology studies beyond that provided by more conventional techniques. Finally, our last study represents the first reconnaissance application of the (U-Th)/He UV laser microprobe in impact chronology studies. Recently, applications of conventional (U-Th)/He zircon and apatite dating techniques have provided important constraints on the ages of some major terrestrial impact structures, but similar studies on lunar samples will likely necessitate the use of more advanced, laser ablation techniques that permit analyses of very small samples. The (U-Th)/He UV laser microprobe is a perfect tool for such studies, but it has not been tested on terrestrial or extraterrestrial impactites. We intend to explore the utility of this technique by applying it to zircons and phosphates from the Mistastin and Apollo 17 impactites. """

Specifically, we propose to perform the following three tasks: 1) Determine the thermal conductivity of complex materials (i.e. layered, cemented samples, and grain mixtures) observed on Mars using laboratory measurements under realistic temperature and pressure conditions, and a numeric model of heat conduction. 2) Develop an improved numerical model of heat transfer for the Martian subsurface based on model that incorporates the thermal conductivity of complex materials and parameterize the outputs. We will develop a web-based interface for this model to allow remote users to easily calculate Martian surface temperatures under current and past conditions. 3) Validate the laboratory work and numerical modeling using Martian surface temperature measurements of cemented, layered and mixtures of grain sizes performed by the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES) onboard MER-A and MER-B in conjunction with the Microscope Imager (MI) data of the same soils. This work will lead to a better understanding of the thermophysical behavior of complex planetary materials under realistic conditions of gas pressure and temperature. These results will significantly improve the characterization of the physical nature and geological processes shaping the Martian surface. Measurements from the Mars Odyssey Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS), the MGS Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES), and the Mars Rover Mini-TES instruments have provided a vast inventory of temperature measurements of the Martian surface at spatial scales from centimeters to kilometers. These data, in conjunction with the laboratory measurements and improved thermal models that will be developed in this work, will lead to a significantly improved characterization of the Martian surface materials, which will in turn lead to a better understanding of Martian aqueous, aeolian, volcanic, and impact processes."

We propose to link cutting-edge, Web-based Virtual Field Trips (VFTs) with lendable Experience Boxes"" containing activity plans, resources and, most significantly, objects to create unique education resources for elementary-, secondary- and informal educators. We will also create digital versions of the Experience Boxes containing virtual objects to maximize the reach of the VFT-Experience Box resources. The topics of the two proposed VFT-Experience Box pairings are Bizarre Animals: The Ediacara of South Australia and Meteorites: Travelers in Space and Time. To accomplish the proposed work, we have developed a novel collaboration between the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI) Team, the Center for Meteorite Studies (CMS) and the Mars Education Program at Arizona State University (ASU), and The Field Museum (TFM), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Australian Centre for Astrobiology.  VFTs transport users to remote environments where they can explore terrain and experience what it is like to ""do science"" in the field. This virtual experience is dynamic, immersive and interactive with 360## sphericals that open windows onto Gigapan imagery that allow a user to examine rock faces in close-ups that mimic actual presence at the rock face. The proposed work will leverage the availability of a VFT from the ASU NAI Team on early life (featuring the Ediacara fossil biota in Australia) for the Bizarre Animals VFT. The proposed work will create a new VFT to the Barringer Meteor Crater (Arizona) for the Meteorites VFT. The Web-based nature of the VFTs make them accessible to students, educators and the public worldwide. The Experience Boxes enhance the VFTs by connecting real objects (rocks, fossils, models) with the selected virtual environments. The Bizzare Animals Experience Box will contain specimens such as fossil casts and the Meteorites Experience Box will contain specimens such as meteorites and impact-related rocks. TFM's Harris Educational Loan Center, one of the largest teacher loan centers in the United States, will provide its expertise in producing hands-on objects and developing Standards-aligned content for the Experience Boxes. Experience Boxes will reside at TFM, ASU and MIT, making them available to three of the 60 largest school districts in the nation.  Digital versions of the Experience Boxes will extend the reach of the VFTs and Experience Boxes outside of the geographic areas served by ASU, TFM and MIT. We will use new technologies to create virtual objects, or ""cyberspecimens"", that can be studied, manipulated and magnified by the user. The virtual objects will enhance the VFT experience by allowing students to interact with science objects in new ways. The virtual objects will be accompanied by digital versions of the other Experience Box contents (e.g., images, movies) and the educator materials to guide use of the VFTs and virtual objects.  To develop teacher knowledge of the subjects covered by the VFTs and Experience Boxes and to train teachers in their use, a series of workshops will be offered at ASU and TFM. Video clips taken from these events will be used to create an online (and therefore widely accessible) training gallery of short videos modelling the use of the Experience Boxes and VFTs and showing classroom footage of the materials. Project assessment will be done by external evaluators and by a small group of teachers who will be involved in the Experience Box and VFT development. By blending immersive digital experiences with the excitement of authentic objects, we hope to improve teaching and learning of STEM topics in elementary, secondary and informal education environments and to increase public engagement in STEM topics."""

They have been studied extensively in concentrates made from acid-insoluble residues, but surprisingly little is known about their petrologic settings in the meteorites because they have not been studied in situ. Information about such settings is fundamental for determining how they formed and were incorporated into the meteorites. The primary goal of the planned research is to determine and compare the petrologic settings of NDs within matrix of different types of carbonaceous chondrites, with the long-term aim of providing new insights regarding the origin of NDs. This research will also provide new data on the structure and major and trace element compositions of individual NDs and regions within them. Transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) provide uniquely powerful information regarding chemical, bonding, and structural data on the scale needed to solve this problem, assuming the NDs can be located within the host matrix. We have developed methods of observing NDs in situ within the fine-grained matrix of primitive meteorites and will use various TEMs to accomplish that goal for several meteorites. High-resolution imaging and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) will permit determination of both structural and chemical information about the NDs and their adjacent minerals. By the middle of the proposed grant period, two state-of-the-art, aberration-corrected TEMs will have been installed at ASU and will be used to locate heavy elements such as Xe, Te, and Pd within the NDs. These TEMs permit the imaging of individual atoms of heavy elements with annular dark-field (ADF) imaging, and these atoms can be identified using EELS. The result of these new types of measurements will provide information about whether such elements, which have been used to determine whether NDs formed in supernovae, occur within the interiors or on the surfaces of the NDs.

AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DISTRIBUTION AND COMPOSITION OF INORGANIC CARBON RESERVOIRS AND THE AQUEOUS ENVIRONMENTS WHICH LEAD TO THEIR FORMATION IS ESSENTIAL TO EVALUATE THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR CARBONATE FORMATION AND WHETHER SUCH CONDITIONS PROVIDE HABITABLE ENVIRONMENTS."

WHILE SATELLITE-BASED OBSERVATIONS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED OUR KNOWLEDGE OF EARTH&#039;S SURFACE CONDITIONS, THERE STILL IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR HIGH-RESOLUTION SOIL MOISTURE FIELDS AT HILLSLOPE TO WATERSHED SCALES DUE TO ITS IMPORTANCE IN CONTROLLING THE PARTITIONING OF ENERGY AND WATER. A NEW GENERATION OF SPACE-BORNE SENSORS ON THE SOIL MOISTURE OCEAN SALINITY MISSION (SMOS) AND SOIL MOISTURE ACTIVE AND PASSIVE (SMAP) MISSION WILL LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IN THE GLOBAL ESTIMATION OF SURFACE SOIL MOISTURE. NEVERTHELESS, THESE NEW ESTIMATES WILL STILL HAVE COARSE RESOLUTIONS AS COMPARED TO EXISTING GROUND NETWORKS (#tilde#10S M) AND AIRCRAFT-BASED ESTIMATES (#tilde#1 KM). AS A RESULT, A MAJOR CHALLENGE IS HOW TO PROPERLY DOWNSCALE (OR DISAGGREGATE) THESE COARSE (BUT RELATIVELY ACCURATE) ESTIMATES TO RESOLUTIONS THAT ARE MORE USEFUL FOR HYDROLOGIC, ECOLOGIC, AND CLIMATOLOGIC APPLICATIONS, AMONG OTHERS. UNFORTUNATELY, MANY EXISTING SOIL MOISTURE DOWNSCALING APPROACHES ARE NOT SUITED FOR OPERATIONAL AND GLOBAL APPLICATION DUE TO THEIR HIGH COMPUTATIONAL DEMAND, LARGE DATA AND PARAMETER REQUIREMENTS OR SITE-SPECIFICITY. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL USE A STATISTICAL DOWNSCALING MODEL FOR GENERATING HIGH-RESOLUTION SOIL MOISTURE FIELDS FROM COARSE SATELLITE DATA THAT HAS SHOWN PROMISE IN PRIOR APPLICATIONS. THE DOWNSCALING MODEL IS BASED ON SCALE-INVARIANCE AND MULTIFRACTAL PROPERTIES EXHIBITED BY SOIL MOISTURE FIELDS OBTAINED FROM AIRCRAFT-BASED SENSORS FLOWN DURING INTENSIVE NASA FIELD CAMPAIGNS. THE ALGORITHM HAS THE PROPERTIES THAT ARE SOUGHT FOR OPERATIONAL AND GLOBAL USE (I.E., LOW COMPUTATIONAL DEMAND AND A FEW PARAMETERS THAN CAN BE LINKED TO READILY-AVAILABLE DATA, ROBUSTNESS ACROSS MULTIPLE SITES). FURTHERMORE, THE DOWNSCALING METHOD GENERATES AN ENSEMBLE (A LARGE SET OF REALIZATIONS) OF HIGH-RESOLUTION SOIL MOISTURE FIELDS (#tilde#1 KM OR LESS) THAT STATISTICALLY ENCOMPASS AVAILABLE AIRCRAFT-BASED OBSERVATIONS. WE PROPOSE TWO MAJOR ACTIVITIES THAT WILL EXPAND THE USEFULNESS OF THE STATISTICAL DOWNSCALING MODEL. IN THE FIRST ACTIVITY, THE DOWNSCALING ALGORITHM WILL BE APPLIED TO ALL AVAILABLE AIRCRAFT-BASED DATA TO DEVELOP A ROBUST, MULTI-SITE CALIBRATION RELATION. THIS WILL BE CARRIED OUT FROM TWO COARSE RESOLUTIONS REPRESENTING THE OPERATIONAL AMRS-E (25 KM) AND FORTHCOMING SMAP (10 KM) PRODUCTS TO TEST THE VALUE ADDED BY THE NEW PRODUCT. IN THE SECOND ACTIVITY, THE DOWNSCALING MODEL WILL BE CALIBRATED USING HIGH-RESOLUTION (10 TO 100 M) SOIL MOISTURE FIELDS GENERATED BY A DISTRIBUTED HYDROLOGIC MODEL APPLIED TO BASINS WITHIN THE MULTIPLE STUDY SITES. MODEL-DERIVED SOIL MOISTURE FIELDS WILL ALLOW EXPANDING THE HYDROLOGIC CONDITIONS AND SCALE RANGE OF THE DOWNSCALING MODEL APPLICATION. FOR BOTH ACTIVITIES, THE ENSEMBLE SOIL MOISTURE FIELDS CAN SERVE AS A STATISTICAL BENCHMARK TO TEST THE USEFULNESS OF THE FORTHCOMING SMAP (AT ITS NATIVE RESOLUTION) AND TO OBTAIN THE SMALL-SCALE VARIABILITY WITHIN SMAP FOOTPRINTS FOR APPLICATIONS AT HIGH RESOLUTION."

IN PARTICULAR, A LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO INCREASE WATER RECOVERY FROM WASTEWATERS TO CREATE A CLOSED-LOOP WATER RECYCLING SYSTEM. CURRENTLY, IN THE WATER RECOVERY SYSTEM (WRS) USED ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS) ONLY 70% OF THE WASTEWATER GENERATED IS RECOVERED; THE REMAINING 30% OF THE WATER IS BRINE THAT IS STORED FOR LATER DISPOSAL. UNDER THIS SYSTEM, WASTEWATER RECYCLING IS DEPENDENT ON RESUPPLY OF WATER FROM THE GROUND TO THE ISS. SINCE NASA HAS RETIRED THE SPACE SHUTTLE FLEET, THE NEED TO MINIMIZE USE OF GROUND-BASED RESOURCES IS A HIGHER PRIORITY. AS A RESULT, NASA FACES THE CHALLENGE OF EITHER DEVELOPING NEW WASTEWATER RECYCLING SYSTEMS OR OPTIMIZING EXISTING ONES TO MAXIMIZE WATER RECOVERY. CURRENT OSMOTIC PROCESSES   BOTH REVERSE OSMOSIS (RO) AND FORWARD OSMOSIS (FO)   OFFER THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE WATER RECOVERY FROM WASTEWATERS CONSISTING OF RAW URINE, PRE-TREATED URINE, AND URINE BRINES. HOWEVER, COMMERCIAL RO AND FO MEMBRANES RAPIDLY DEGRADE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE ACIDIC PRE-TREATED URINE AND URINE BRINES. ADDITIONALLY, THESE COMMERCIAL RO AND FO MEMBRANES ARE FLAWED IN THAT THEY ARE NOT A SUFFICIENT BARRIER TO SMALL ORGANIC COMPOUNDS COMMONLY FOUND IN URINE, SUCH AS UREA. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A NEW CLASS OF CORROSION-RESISTANT MOLECULAR SIEVE INCLUSION NANOCOMPOSITE (MOSIN) MEMBRANES AND TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS FOR RECOVERING WATER FROM URINE AND URINE BRINE SOLUTIONS THROUGH OSMOTIC PROCESSES. IN OUR MOSIN MEMBRANES, A LIQUID-BARRIER, CHEMICAL-RESISTANT POLYMER MATRIX BINDS A LAYER OF SELECTIVE MOLECULAR SIEVE NANOPARTICLES INTO A FLEXIBLE, ROBUST NANOCOMPOSITE THIN FILM. THIS DESIGN LEVERAGES UNIQUE ASPECTS OF THE TWO COMPONENT MATERIALS: (1) THE HIGH INTRINSIC FLUX AND SELECTIVITY OF THE MOLECULAR SIEVE NANOPARTICLES AND (2) THE CORROSION-RESISTANCE, FLEXIBILITY, AND MECHANICAL ROBUSTNESS OF THE LIQUIDBARRIER POLYMER SUPPORT MATRIX. UNLIKE TRADITIONAL POLYMERIC LIQUID FILTRATION MEMBRANES, OUR DESIGN DOES NOT REQUIRE THE POLYMER MATRIX TO HAVE LIQUID PERMEABILITY A FACT THAT ENABLES US TO USE A BROADER SPECTRUM OF CORROSION-RESISTANT POLYMERS. TWO KEY ASPECTS OF THIS DESIGN CONCEPT ARE: (1) THE MOLECULAR SIEVE NANOPARTICLES PROVIDE A SINGLE PARTICLE PATHWAY THROUGH THE SUPPORTING POLYMERIC MATRIX BECAUSE THEY PENETRATE BOTH SIDES OF THE FILM AND (2) OUR MEMBRANES WILL BE FABRICATED THROUGH INEXPENSIVE POLYMER PROCESSING TECHNIQUES. WE WILL INCORPORATE HIGH PERMEABILITY WATER-SELECTIVE LINDE TYPE A (LTA) ZEOLITE MOLECULAR SIEVE NANOPARTICLES INTO CORROSION RESISTANT POLYMERIC THIN FILMS (POLYETHYLENE TEREPHTHALATE, HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE AND POLYTETRAFLUOROETHYLENE). WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE FUNDAMENTAL CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS WHICH INFLUENCE THE FORMATION OF OUR MOSIN MEMBRANES. IN PARTICULAR WE WILL INVESTIGATE HOW CHANGES IN FABRICATION PARAMETERS RELATE TO THE CHEMICAL STRUCTURE, PHYSICAL MORPHOLOGY, OSMOTIC SEPARATION PERFORMANCE, AND ZEOLITE/POLYMER INTERFACE USING A VARIETY OF CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES. WE WILL EVALUATE THE LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE AND CORROSION RESISTANCE OF THE MEMBRANES IN FORWARD OSMOSIS FOR DEWATERING OF SYNTHETIC URINE AND PRE-TREATED URINE. WE WILL EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MEMBRANES IN REVERSE OSMOSIS FOR WATER RECOVERY FROM CONCENTRATED URINE BRINES."

A MAJOR LIMITATION OF REPEAT ALTIMETRY MEASUREMENTS, HOWEVER, IS THAT VARIATIONS IN THE DENSITY OF SURFACE ACCUMULATION AND THE FIRN LAYER MUST BE CONSTRAINED IN ORDER TO EXTRACT ICE THICKNESS AND MASS CHANGE. AS THINNING INITIATED AT THE MARGIN OF THE ICE SHEET PROPAGATES INLAND THIS LIMITATION IS BECOMING MORE PROBLEMATIC FOR TWO REASONS: FIRST, AS THINNING PROPAGATES AND DIFFUSES, THE RATE OF THINNING DECEASES RELATIVE TO VARIATIONS IN ACCUMULATION AND COMPACTION, BECOMING MORE DIFFICULT TO OBSERVE. SECOND, SUBSTANTIAL THINNING IS NOW OCCURRING IN THE WET SNOW AND PERCOLATION ZONES OF THE ICE SHEET WHERE VARIATIONS IN DENSITY ARE PARTICULARLY UNCONSTRAINED AND MODELS PERFORM POORLY. ADDITIONALLY, RECENT WARMING AND HISTORICALLY EXTREME MELT EVENTS MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGING THE DENSITY OF THE FIRN, EFFECTING ALTIMETER MEASUREMENTS. HERE WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AND TEST DEPLOY IN SITU SENSOR PACKAGES THAT WILL AID THE DECONVOLUTION OF SURFACE CHANGE OBSERVATIONS. EACH SENSOR PACKAGE WILL CONSIST OF A DEVICE FOR MEASURING DEEP-FIRN COMPACTION, A SNOW PILLOW FOR MEASURING ACCUMULATION MASS, AND AN ECHO SOUNDER FOR MEASURING ACCUMULATION THICKNESS. THE SENSORS WILL BROADCAST THEIR DATA DAILY VIA IRIDIUM UPLINK AND WILL BE DESIGNED TO WITHSTAND AT LEAST 2 YEARS OF ACCUMULATION, DEPENDING ON LOCATION, REDUCING THE REVISIT TIME. THE SENSOR DATA WILL BE USED TO CALIBRATE METEOROLOGICAL REANALYSIS MODEL OUTPUT THAT WILL DRIVE A SURFACE ACCUMULATION AND FIRN COMPACTION MODEL. FOR THIS TEST PHASE, WE WILL DEPLOY ONE SENSOR ABOVE JAKOBSHAVN ISBRAE IN THE WEST, AND ANOTHER ABOVE HELHEIM GLACIER IN THE SOUTHEAST; TWO REGIONS UNDERGOING SUBSTANTIAL DYNAMIC CHANGES.

THESE ARE KEY COMPONENTS OF BOTH THE NRC PLANETARY SCIENCE 2013-2022 DECADAL SURVEY AND THE NASA SMD 2007-2016 SCIENCE PLAN. THE MOST DIRECT METHOD FOR IMAGING AND MONITORING INTERIOR STRESSES IS THROUGH ANALYSIS OF SEISMOLOGICAL DATA.

AT PRESENT, A ROBUST, LOW POWER, LOW MASS, SMALL FORM FACTOR, AND RELATIVELY LOW COST BROADBAND SEISMOMETER THAT CAN BE EMPLOYED ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF MISSION TYPES WITH VARIOUS DEPLOYMENT SCENARIOS DOES NOT YET EXIST. TO ACHIEVE THIS FIRST-ORDER GOAL, A NEXT GENERATION SEISMIC INSTRUMENT MUST BE DEVELOPED. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP THE INTEGRATED SEISMIC INSTRUMENT SYSTEM (ISIS), A COMPLETE BROADBAND MICRO-SEISMOMETER INSTRUMENT WITH COMPREHENSIVE LAB AND FIELD TESTING AND VALIDATION THAT WILL BE THE BASIS OF A FLIGHT INSTRUMENT THAT CAN BE PROPOSED FOR A RANGE OF SOLAR SYSTEM MISSIONS.

THESE COMPONENTS INCLUDE: IONIC LIQUID ELECTROLYTE, SENSOR CELL PACKAGE, CONTROL ELECTRONICS, AND AN INSTRUMENT HOUSING. WITH THE INTEGRATION AND COMPREHENSIVE TESTING, ISIS WILL BE BROUGHT TO TRL 4 AND POSSIBLY CLOSE TO 5 BY THE END OF THIS THREE-YEAR PROJECT. DEVELOPMENT OF ISIS WILL PROVIDE A FUNDAMENTALLY IMPROVED ADVANCEMENT IN THE TECHNICAL STATE OF SEISMIC INSTRUMENTATION AVAILABLE FOR FLIGHT OPPORTUNITIES. ITS DESIGN STEPS FAR BEYOND ANY CURRENT FLIGHT INSTRUMENTATION DUE TO ITS UNIQUE AND HIGHLY DESIRABLE COMBINATION OF CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING LOW MASS, LOW POWER USAGE, HIGH SHOCK TOLERANCE, LACK OF NEED TO LEVEL, BROADBAND SENSOR, AND FLEXIBILITY OF DEPLOYMENT.

EACH OBJECTIVE UTILIZES TECHNIQUES THAT HAVE BEEN TESTED IN AN INITIAL STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE PRINCIPLE INVESTIGATOR AND GRADUATE STUDENT INVESTIGATOR. TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVE #1, THE MOON WILL BE DIVIDED INTO 12 TILES, EACH ENCOMPASSING #tilde#3 MILLION KM2. THE NEARSIDE MARIA WILL BE EXCLUDED FROM THE TILES USING THE AVAILABLE LRO MARE SHAPEFILE. THE LIGHT PLAINS WILL BE MAPPED TILE-BY-TILE WITH ARCGIS MAPPING SOFTWARE USING IMAGES FROM THE LRO WIDE ANGLE CAMERA (WAC) AS WELL AS A MAP OF THE STANDARD DEVIATION OF SLOPE DERIVED FROM THE GLOBAL LUNAR DIGITAL TERRAIN MODEL (GLD 100), WHICH IS USED AS A PROXY FOR ROUGHNESS. THE AVERAGE ELEVATIONS OF INDIVIDUAL LIGHT PLAINS DEPOSITS WILL BE MEASURED FROM THE GLD 100 AND ASSESSED RELATIVE TO THE RANGE OF ELEVATIONS OF THE MARIA TO DETERMINE IF THE LIGHT PLAINS ARE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS A LARGE RANGE OF ELEVATIONS, AS WE WOULD EXPECT IF THEY ARE IMPACT EJECTA, OR A NARROW RANGE, WHICH WOULD FAVOR A VOLCANIC ORIGIN LIKE THE MARIA. TO ADDRESS OBJECTIVE #2, IMAGES FROM BOTH THE LRO WAC AND NARROW ANGLE CAMERA (NAC) WILL BE EXAMINED TO IDENTIFY MORPHOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE LIGHT PLAINS AND LARGE LUNAR BASINS. USING EXISTING TOOLS WITHIN THE ARCGIS SOFTWARE PACKAGE, THE DISTRIBUTION OF LIGHT PLAINS WITH RESPECT TO INDIVIDUAL BASINS WILL BE ASSESSED BY DETERMINING HOW THE SURFACE COVERAGE OF LIGHT PLAINS VARIES WITH INCREASING DISTANCE FROM THE BASIN RIM. IF THE AREAL ABUNDANCE OF LIGHT PLAINS GRADUALLY DECREASES WITH INCREASING DISTANCE FROM THE BASIN RIM, THEN THE LIGHT PLAINS IN THE AREA BEING ASSESSED LIKELY ORIGINATED WITH THE FORMATION OF THAT BASIN. OBJECTIVE #3 WILL BE ADDRESSED BY EXAMINING BOTH WAC AND NAC IMAGES TO LOOK FOR CROSS-CUTTING AND SUPERPOSITION RELATIONSHIPS. USING THESE RELATIONSHIPS, WE WILL DETERMINE WHEN THE LIGHT PLAINS WERE DEPOSITED ON THE SURFACE. TO FURTHER CONSTRAIN THE AGE OF THE DEPOSITS, CRATER MEASUREMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED ON REPRESENTATIVE AREAS USING BOTH WAC AND NAC IMAGES. THE LUNAR CHRONOLOGY AND PRODUCTION FUNCTIONS OF NEUKUM ET AL. (2001) WILL BE APPLIED TO THE RESULTING DATASET TO CALCULATE THE ABSOLUTE MODEL AGES FOR THE LIGHT PLAINS. THESE AGES WILL THEN BE COMPARED TO BOTH FEATURES OF KNOWN AGES AND ABSOLUTE AGE ESTIMATES FOR FEATURES FOR WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE SAMPLES. IF WE FIND THAT THE MAJORITY OF LIGHT PLAINS CAN BE RELATED TO THE FORMATION OF LARGE BASINS, THEN WE WILL HAVE GAINED INSIGHT INTO THE DEGREE TO WHICH LARGE BASINS MODIFY THE SURFACE OF THE MOON, WHICH MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR OTHER PLANETARY BODIES.  IF WE FIND THAT THE LIGHT PLAINS CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY RELATIONSHIPS TO LARGE BASINS, THEN WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBILITY OF A VOLCANIC ORIGIN WITH OTHER PERTINENT DATASETS, SUCH AS COMPOSITIONAL DATA. IN THIS CASE, WE WILL HAVE IDENTIFIED A PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN STYLE OF VOLCANISM ON THE MOON.

HOW COULD WATER REMAIN LIQUID? IS IT STILL THERE? THERMAL MODELS OF KBOS HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF SUSTAINING SUBSURFACE LIQUID WATER BY RADIOGENIC HEATING, DESPITE FRIGID SURFACE TEMPERATURES. SUBSURFACE LIQUID IS PREDICTED TO PERSIST FOR MANY GYR ON BODIES AS SMALL AS CHARON (RADIUS 600 KM). THESE MODELS ARE BROADLY APPLICABLE TO MANY OTHER LARGE KBOS OR DWARF PLANETS, INCLUDING CERES (WHICH HAS BEEN SUGGESTED TO HAVE FORMED TOGETHER WITH KBOS IN THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM).

THE MODIFICATION OF ROCK THERMAL PROPERTIES (E.G., THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY) UPON HYDRATION IS ANOTHER PRIME EXAMPLE OF HOW GEOCHEMISTRY MUST BE COUPLED TO GEOPHYSICS, TO INVESTIGATE DWARF PLANET EVOLUTION AND LIQUID PERSISTENCE. TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS, WE PROPOSE TO: 1. MODEL THE TYPES OF FLUID FLOW ON SMALL BODIES: (A) QUANTIFY CONVECTION-DRIVEN HYDROTHERMAL CIRCULATION THROUGH A PERMEABLE CORE, CRACKED FROM THERMAL CONTRACTION; AND (B) ANALYTICALLY DETERMINE THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO INITIATE CRYOVOLCANISM. 2. USE AVAILABLE GEOCHEMICAL CODES TO MODEL ABUNDANCES OF SPECIES IN THE SUBSURFACE FLUID, INCLUDING TEMPERATURE AND CHEMISTRY AS FLUID RISES TO THE SURFACE, AND MINERALS PRODUCED BY WATER-ROCK INTERACTION, TO PRODUCE A GEOCHEMISTRY SUBROUTINE TO BE USED IN THERMAL EVOLUTION CODES. 3.

THE CHALLENGE TO ANSWERING THIS QUESTION IS THAT WE HAVE BARELY BEGUN TO GLIMPSE THE DIVERSITY OF PLANET TYPES, LET ALONE CONSIDERED THEIR INNER WORKINGS AND CHEMICAL CYCLES. MOREOVER, THE DETECTABILITY OF LIFE IS DISTINCT FROM HABITABILITY. IN ORDER TO LEAVE A DISTINGUISHABLE BIOSIGNATURE, A PLANETS ECOSYSTEMS MUST PRODUCE OR CONSUME KEY COMPOUNDS AT RATES THAT EXCEED ITS NATURAL ABIOTIC CYCLES. THE COMPELLING QUESTION WE ARE CALLED FORTH TO ANSWER IS: WHICH TYPES OF PLAUSIBLE EXOPLANETS CAN HARBOR DETECTABLE ECOSYSTEMS THAT METABOLIZE FASTER THAN THEIR GEOCHEMICAL CYCLES? THROUGH A HIGHLY INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH, ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY''S CAN7 TEAM WILL ADVANCE EXOPLANET CHARACTERIZATION, PRODUCING A PERIODIC TABLE OF PLANETS THAT LAYS A FOUNDATION FOR DETECTING OF LIFE ON EXOPLANETS. THIS APPROACH HAS FOUR BROAD TASKS: IN OUR STELLAR STOICHIOMETRY TASK, WE WILL CREATE THE FIRST UNIFIED CATALOG OF HUNDREDS OF NEARBY SUN-LIKE STARS ELEMENTAL ABUNDANCES AND OTHER FACTORS LIKE HABITABLE ZONE LIFETIMES THAT AFFECT HABITABILITY. IN OUR PLANET FORMATION TASK, WE WILL MODEL MINERAL CONDENSATION AND PLANETARY ACCRETION IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS, TO DETERMINE THE RANGE OF ROCK/METAL COMPOSITIONS (E.G., MG:SI RATIOS) OF EXOPLANETS. WE WILL MODEL TRANSPORT OF WATER AND VOLATILES THROUGH DISKS, CONSIDERING PHOTOEVAPORATION BY NEARBY MASSIVE STARS AND CONSTRAINING OUR MODELS WITH ASTRONOMICAL AND METEORITIC OBSERVATIONS. WE WILL DETERMINE THE RANGE OF WATER CONTENT ON EXOPLANETS, IDENTIFYING FACTORS THAT LEAD TO WATER WORLDS OR DESERT PLANETS AND THE RELATIVE FREQUENCIES OF THESE EXOPLANET TYPES. IN OUR PLANETARY PROCESSES TASK, WE WILL MEASURE HIGH-PRESSURE MINERAL PROPERTIES AND CONSTRUCT ACCURATE MASS-RADIUS RELATIONS FOR EXOPLANETS. WE WILL MODEL THE INTERIORS AND MANTLE-SURFACE EXCHANGE IN REPRESENTATIVE EXOPLANETS, CALCULATING CONVECTION AND MIXING IN ICE VII MANTLES ON WATER WORLDS AND IN ROCKY MANTLES WITH VARIABLE MG:SI RATIO.

WE WILL PROBE THE GENETIC AND METABOLIC DIVERSITY AT THESE SITES, TO EXTRAPOLATE THESE METABOLIC RATES TO EXOPLANETARY ECOSYSTEMS. WE WILL INTEGRATE THESE INTERDISCIPLINARY EFFORTS BY COMPARING, FOR REPRESENTATIVE EXOPLANETS, THEIR ABIOTIC GEOCHEMICAL RATES WITH THEIR ECOSYSTEMS METABOLIC RATES. WE WILL DETERMINE THE RANGE OF EXOPLANET TYPES POSSIBLE, AND DEVELOP A METHOD TO PRIORITIZE FOR FUTURE STUDY THOSE TYPES THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO YIELD DETECTABLE EVIDENCE OF LIFE.

UNDERSTANDING THE GALAXY SPECTRA WILL NOT ONLY HELP US ADDRESS MAJOR ISSUES IN GALAXY FORMATION AND EVOLUTION, BUT WILL ALSO REDUCE RANDOM AND SYSTEMATIC ERRORS IN THE REDSHIFT DETERMINATION FOR BAO AND WEAK LENSING EXPERIMENTS. WE OFFER EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE OF STUDYING LINE EMITTERS FROM Z=0.3-7, USING BOTH SLITLESS SPECTROSCOPY ON HST AND NARROW-BAND IMAGING FROM THE GROUND, TOGETHER WITH HIGHER RESOLUTION GROUND-BASED SPECTROSCOPIC FOLLOWUP. THE HST SLITLESS SPECTROGRAPHS ARE THE BEST ANALOGS TO THE WFIRST-AFTA SPECTROGRAPH IN SPECTRAL AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION, AND IN OPERATIONS MODE. THERE ARE UNIQUE CHALLENGES IN SLITLESS SPECTROSCOPY, AND OUR EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WILL HELP TO MEET THEM.

WFIRST''S CORE MISSION OBJECTIVES EXPLICITLY INCLUDE THE PHYSICS OF THE UNIVERSE (THROUGH DARK ENERGY SURVEYS) AND NEW WORLDS (THROUGH MICROLENSING AND PERHAPS CORONOGRAPHIC OBSERVATIONS). WFIRST-AFTA CAN MAKE EQUALLY POWERFUL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STUDY OF COSMIC DAWN. ITS SENSITIVITY, SPATIAL RESOLUTION, AND WIDE FIELD OF VIEW MAKE IT UNIQUELY POWERFUL FOR STUDYING THE FIRST FAINT, HIGHLY REDSHIFTED GALAXIES.  WE PROPOSE TO: (1) APPLY THIS ACCUMULATED EXPERTISE, SOFTWARE AND EXISTING HST DATA TO HELP WITH THE PREDICTIONS, SIMULATIONS, AND DETAILED PLANNING AND POSSIBLE OPTIMIZATION OF SPECTROSCOPIC OBSERVATIONS. (2) DETAIL HOW STUDIES OF EMISSION LINE GALAXIES (ELGS) BETWEEN Z=1-3 WILL ADDRESS OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS IN GALAXY EVOLUTION AND ASSEMBLY AT THE PEAK OF STAR-FORMATION AND AGN ACTIVITY AT Z=1-3. (3) EXPLORE HOW WFIRST-AFTA CAN REVOLUTIONIZE ALSO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF COSMIC DAWN, BOTH USING THE ALREADY-PLANNED HLS AND SUPERNOVA SURVEY, AND THROUGH DEEP GO OBSERVATIONS. FOR THIS WE WILL USE THE COLLECTIVE POWER OF HST SLITLESS GRISM DATA BOTH WITH ACS AND WFC3 AS WELL AS SIMULATION PACKAGES SUCH AS AXESIM. WE HAVE LED SEVERAL LARGE GRISM PROGRAMS, AND DEVELOPED SOFTWARE FOR BOTH SIMULATING AND ANALYSING SLITLESS GRISM DATA (AXE AND AXESIM). WE HAVE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO DESIGN AND PLANNING OF JDEM/WFIRST MISSIONS AND WHITE PAPERS. WE WILL ADAPT OUR SOFTWARE TO WFIRST, AND USE IT FOR END-TO-END SIMULATIONS OF THE WFIRST SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY, TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED PROPERTIES OF THE WFIRST EMISSION LINE GALAXY SAMPLES. WE WILL SUMMARIZE OUR RESULTS IN THREE WHITE PAPERS, ON (1) THOSE PROPERTIES OF EMISSION LINE GALAXY POPULATIONS MOST CRUCIAL TO WFIRST PLANNING; (2) THE PROSPECTS FOR REIONIZATION TESTS USING WFIRST-AFTA; AND (3) THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF CHANGES TO EITHER INSTRUMENTAL PARAMTERS OR OBSERVING STRATEGY ON THE RESULTING EMISSION LINE GALAXY SAMPLES."""

THE PRIMARY CONCEPT IS THE REALIZATION OF A HIGH TEMPERATURE, HIGH EFFICIENCY TANDEM SOLAR CELL DEVICE BASED ON INGAN MATERIALS. AS IS WELL KNOWN, THE INXGA1XN TERNARY COMPOUND SYSTEM HAS A RANGE OF BANDGAPS BASED ON THE MOLE FRACTION, X, OF IN THAT SPANS THE ENTIRE SOLAR SPECTRUM. FURTHERMORE, NITRIDE BASED ELECTRONICS AND OPTOELECTRONICS ARE DEMONSTRATED TO OPERATE AT HIGH TEMPERATURES  400 C AND ARE THE BASIS FOR HIGH POWER, HIGH TEMPERATURE ELECTRONICS. THEY ALSO SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR A RAPIDLY GROWING WHITE LIGHT EMITTING DIODE LED MARKET, WITH WELL ESTABLISHED ROADMAPS FOR COST REDUCTION AND MANUFACTURABILITY. THE FOLLOWING KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PROPOSED SOLAR CELL ALLOW HIGH EFFICIENCY AND HIGH TEMPERATURE OPERATION.   A TWO JUNCTION INGAN BASED TANDEM SOLAR CELL STRUCTURE TO EXCEED THE NASA TARGET SOLAR CELL EFFICIENCY GOALS  25 OPERATING AT OR NEAR THE OPERATING TEMPERATURE OF THE SOLAR THERMAL SYSTEM.  ADVANCED DEVICE STRUCTURES AND FABRICATION METHODS SUITABLE FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE OPERATION SUCH AS HIGH THERMAL STABILITY METAL CONTACT METALLURGY WITH LOW SPECIFIC CONTACT RESISTANCE AND ALL NITRIDE BASED SEMICONDUCTOR COMPONENTS.  NOVEL HETEROSTRUCTURE CARRIER SELECTIVE CONTACT STRUCTURES IN THE ABSORBER LAYER TO INCREASE OPEN CIRCUIT VOLTAGE AND RELAX THE DOPING REQUIREMENTS IN THE PHOTOACTIVE REGIONS.  THERMIONIC ESCAPE FROM  SHALLOW  QUANTUM WELLS QWS THAT ACHIEVES HIGH EFFICIENCY THROUGH INCREASED PHOTOCARRIER COLLECTION AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES.  A FLEXIBLE DEVICE TECHNOLOGY TO ALLOW FOR CONFORMAL MOUNTING OF THE SOLAR CELL DEVICE TO THE TARGET SOLAR THERMAL TECHNOLOGY, AND REDUCE SUBSTRATE AND RELATED MATERIAL COSTS.  ADVANTAGES THE PROPOSED III NITRIDE SOLAR CELL HAS NUMEROUS ADVANTAGES IF INTEGRATING INTO A CONCENTRATED SOLAR POWER CSP SYSTEM, RELATING TO ITS PERFORMANCE, COST, SCALABILITY AND FEASIBILITY. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROPOSED INGAN SOLAR CELL ALLOWS A SYSTEM WITH HIGHER EFFICIENCY AND LOWER COSTS THAN ANY OTHER SOLAR BASED ELECTRICITY SYSTEM, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ALLOWING A LARGE FRACTION OF DISPATCHABLE ELECTRICITY, THUS ADDRESSING THE MAJOR PRESENT DRAWBACK WITH PV SYSTEMS. FURTHERMORE, THROUGH THE EXISTING LED INDUSTRY, THE DEVICES HAVE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED RELIABILITY AND SCALABILITY. FINALLY, THE ABILITY TO MAKE HIGH PERFORMANCE HIGHER BANDGAP INGAN SOLAR CELLS HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED. THESE ADVANTAGES ARE SUMMARIZED IN  TABLE I OF THE FULL PROPOSAL.  IMPACTS AND INFUSION THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGH EFFICIENCY INGAN SOLAR CELL ENABLES A TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE IN THE ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY GENERATE POWER WITHOUT CONCERNS OF OPERATIONAL TEMPERATURES, WHICH IS A KEY REQUIREMENT FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS. THE KEY ASPECTS OF THE APPROACH ARE TO CAPITALIZE ON THE UNIQUE PROPERTIES OF THE III NITRIDE MATERIALS SYSTEMS, WHICH EXCLUSIVELY AMONG COMMERCIAL SEMICONDUCTORS ALLOW HIGH TEMPERATURE OPERATION. FURTHER, WE CAPITALIZE ON THE RAPID GROWTH INDUSTRIES BASED ON THE III NITRIDES SUCH AS SOLID STATE LIGHTING, WHICH DRIVES BOTH TECHNICAL INNOVATION AND REDUCED COSTS. A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF THE RESEARCH WILL BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO VARIOUS NASA MISSIONS AS POWER GENERATION IS CRITICAL TO SPACE TECHNOLOGY, ESPECIALLY FOR SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE SMD MISSIONS FOCUSED ON DESTINATIONS CLOSER TO THE SUN. OTHER IMPACT INCLUDES ENABLES A TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE IN THE ABILITY TO INTEGRATE RENEWABLE ENERGY INTO THE ELECTRICITY GRID."

IT IS A WORLD WHERE TIDES ARE THE DOMINANT PROCESS, CONTROLLING BOTH SURFACE MODIFICATION AND INTERIOR STRUCTURE. WE NOW KNOW THAT EUROPA IS NOT UNIQUE; TINY, ICE-COVERED ENCELADUS DISPLAYS TECTONIC ACTIVITY, PLUME ERUPTIONS, AND HIGH HEAT FLOW THAT ARE ALL LIKELY GOVERNED BY TIDES. STUDYING TIDAL-TECTONIC PROCESSES ON EUROPA PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR INTERPRETING SURFACES OF ALL BODIES IN WHICH TIDES PLAY A ROLE. HOWEVER, FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THESE TECHNIQUES IS REQUIRED TO FULLY UNDERSTAND TIDAL-TECTONIC PROCESSES AND INTERPRET THE DYNAMICAL, TIDAL, AND INTERIOR EVOLUTION RECORDED ON EUROPA''S SURFACE. TECTONIC ACTIVITY ON EUROPA HAS BEEN LINKED TO TIDAL STRESS CAUSED BY ITS ECCENTRIC ORBIT, FINITE OBLIQUITY, AND POSSIBLY NON-SYNCHRONOUS ROTATION OF THE ICY SHELL. CYCLOIDS AND OTHER LINEAMENTS ARE THOUGHT TO FORM IN RESPONSE TO TIDAL NORMAL STRESS WHILE STRIKE-SLIP MOTION ALONG PREEXISTING FAULTS HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO TIDAL SHEAR STRESS. TECTONIC FEATURES CAN THUS PROVIDE CONSTRAINTS ON THE ROTATIONAL PARAMETERS THAT GOVERN TIDAL STRESS AND INSIGHT INTO THE TIDAL-TECTONIC PROCESSES OPERATING ON ICE-COVERED OCEAN BODIES. TIDAL-TECTONIC FORMATION MODELS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT FITTING LARGE-SCALE TRENDS IN THE POPULATIONS OF CYCLOIDS, STRIKE-SLIP FAULTS, AND LINEAMENTS, AS WELL AS REPRODUCING THE PATHS OF INDIVIDUAL CYCLOIDS. HOWEVER, SIMPLIFICATIONS IN THE TIDAL STRESS CALCULATIONS AND IN THE ROLE OF EUROPA''S INTERIOR STRUCTURE HAVE LED TO LIMITATIONS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY EXPLORED. IN PAST TIDAL-TECTONIC MODELING EFFORTS, EUROPA''S ICE SHELL HAS BEEN TREATED AS UNIFORM AND ELASTIC, OVERLYING A GLOBAL OCEAN. HOWEVER, THE DEPTH-DEPENDENT VISCOELASTIC NATURE OF ICE SHELLS WILL AFFECT LONG-TERM SOURCES OF STRESS, INCLUDING NON-SYNCHRONOUS ROTATION. IN FACT, VISCOUS RELAXATION HAS EVEN BEEN SHOWN TO CAUSE A PHASE LAG IN DIURNAL TIDAL STRESS. THE EFFECT OF THESE CHANGES ON FRACTURE FORMATION HAS YET TO BE INVESTIGATED. IN ADDITION, IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT EUROPA''S GEOLOGIC ACTIVITY HAS CHANGED OVER TIME. ONE THEORY IS THAT EUROPA''S FRACTURES ARE OLDER, HAVING FORMED WHEN THE ICE WAS RELATIVELY THIN, WHEREAS CHAOS FEATURES ARE YOUNGER AND FORMED THROUGH CONVECTION IN A THICKER SHELL. SIMILARLY, LINEAMENTS AND CYCLOIDS ARE BOTH THOUGHT TO BE TIDALLY-DRIVEN TENSILE FRACTURES, AND YET, DISPLAY VERY DIFFERENT MORPHOLOGIES. IT HAS BEEN PROPOSED THAT CYCLOIDS FORMED AT A TIME WHEN DIURNAL STRESSES DOMINATED WHEREAS LINEAMENTS FORMED WHEN NON-SYNCHRONOUS ROTATION (NSR) STRESSES DOMINATED. EVEN FOR THE SAME ROTATION PERIOD, THE STRESSES INDUCED BY NSR CAN CHANGE DRAMATICALLY BASED ON THE RHEOLOGY OF THE ICE SHELL. VARIATIONS IN ECCENTRICITY OR OBLIQUITY COULD AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF HEAT DISSIPATED WITHIN EUROPA; CHANGES IN HEAT COULD ALTER THE VISCOSITY OF THE ICE SHELL, PERHAPS DRIVING DIFFERENT TYPES OF GEOLOGIC ACTIVITY ON EUROPA. WE PROPOSE TO INCORPORATE RHEOLOGY-DEPENDENT TIDAL STRESS EQUATIONS INTO EXISTING TIDAL-TECTONIC MODELS AND TEST OUR MODEL PREDICTIONS AGAINST OBSERVED CYCLOIDS, LINEAMENTS, AND STRIKE-SLIP FAULTS.WE WILL THEN ASSESS THE ROLE OF NONSYNCHRONOUS ROTATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF TIDAL-TECTONIC FEATURES AND TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE RHEOLOGY OF EUROPA''S ICE SHELL HAS CHANGED WITH TIME."

WE PROPOSE A HYBRID EULERIAN/LAGRANGIAN APPROACH THAT COMBINES A EULERIAN VOLUME OF FLUID INTERFACE CAPTURING APPROACH IN THE PRIMARY ATOMIZATION REGION WITH A LAGRANGIAN APPROACH IN THE SECONDARY ATOMIZATION REGION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS A MODEL FREE OF ADJUSTABLE TUNING PARAMETERS. TO THAT END, A NOVEL DUAL SCALE LES APPROACH IS PROPOSED TO PREDICT THE PRIMARY ATOMIZATION PROCESS CLOSE TO THE FUEL INJECTOR. INSTEAD OF RELYING ON THE TRADITIONAL LES MODELING PARADIGM THAT DYNAMICS ON THE UNRESOLVED SUB-FILTER SCALE FOLLOW A CERTAIN UNIVERSALITY AND CAN BE INFERRED SOLELY FROM THE DYNAMICS ON THE RESOLVED SCALES, THE DUAL SCALE APPROACH AIMS TO MAINTAIN A REPRESENTATIVE FULLY RESOLVED REALIZATION OF THE LIQUID/GAS PHASE INTERFACE GEOMETRY. THIS NOT ONLY PROVIDES DIRECT CLOSURE MODELS FOR THE FILTERED TERMS IN THE NAVIER-STOKES EQUATION BUT ALSO, MORE IMPORTANTLY, ALLOWS FOR DIRECT CAPTURING OF THE SMALL SCALE PHASE INTERFACE DYNAMICS DURING BREAKUP, AVOIDING ANY PHENOMENOLOGICAL AD-HOC MODELS FOR THE PRIMARY ATOMIZATION PROCESS ON THE SUB-FILTER SCALE OR THE QUESTIONABLE ASSUMPTION OF UNIVERSALITY OF THE PHASE INTERFACE DYNAMICS ON THE SUBFILTER SCALE.

THESE LIQUID DROPS (BLOBS) NEED FURTHER ACCURATE MODELING OF THE DROP DYNAMICS AT THE SUBGRID SCALE LEVEL. A LAGRANGIAN APPROACH HERE IS ADVANTAGEOUS AS IT ALLOWS FOR EXPLICIT MODELING OF VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE DROP DYNAMICS IMPORTANT FOR SECONDARY ATOMIZATION AND DROPLET DISPERSION. A TWO-PARAMETER STOCHASTIC BREAKUP MODEL WILL BE EMPLOYED FOR SECONDARY ATOMIZATION AT LARGE REYNOLDS AND WEBER NUMBERS REPRESENTATIVE OF REALISTIC AIRCRAFT FUEL INJECTORS. IN ADDITION, NEAR THE INJECTOR, IN THE DENSE SPRAY REGIME, THE DROPLET-DROPLET INTERACTIONS, DROPLET DEFORMATION AND INTERNAL CIRCULATION EFFECTS ON THE DRAG AND LIFT FORCES CAN BE IMPORTANT. IT IS THUS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE UPON THE STANDARD POINT-PARTICLE, TWO-WAY COUPLING BASED SUBGRID SCALE MODELS FOR SPRAY DYNAMICS. ACCOUNTING FOR THE FLUID MASS DISPLACED BY THE DROPLETS IS IMPORTANT AND REQUIRES REFORMULATION OF THE EULERIAN FLUID PHASE GOVERNING EQUATIONS TO INCLUDE CARRIER PHASE VOLUME FRACTION VARIATIONS.  TO MAKE THE DEVELOPED MODELS APPLICABLE TO REALISTIC AIRCRAFT INJECTOR GEOMETRIES A FULLY UNSTRUCTURED FLOW SOLVER WILL BE USED THAT HAS PROVEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE PAST IN SIMULATING THE FLOW IN AIRCRAFT ENGINES. THE TO BE DEVELOPED MODELS WILL BE VERIFIED USING A HIERARCHY OF DIRECT NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF EVER MORE COMPLEX ATOMIZING FLOWS, CULMINATING IN THE SIMULATION OF A REALISTIC HIGH SHEAR FUEL INJECTION NOZZLE GEOMETRY PROPOSED BY UNITED TECHNOLOGIES RESEARCH CENTER CONSISTING OF SIX LIQUID JETS INJECTING INTO A SWIRLING INNER CROSSFLOW AND FURTHER ATOMIZING WITH AN OUTER SWIRLING AIRFLOW.

HERE WE PROPOSE TO USE DEPTHPROFILING BY ION MICROPROBE TO MEASURE THE OXYGEN ISOTOPE COMPOSITION OF EARTHS UPPER ATMOSPHERE. THE OXYGEN COMPOSITION OF THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE IS PRIMARILY O ATOMS AND O+ IONS. THESE HIGHLY REACTIVE SPECIES BECOME IMPLANTED IN THE TARGET SURFACE AND POSSIBLY REPLACE O IN ANY TARGET OXIDE LAYER PRESENT AT LAUNCH. PRELIMINARY NANOSIMS DATA OBTAINED AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY FOR AN LDEF AL TARGET (FROM A REGION OF THE TARGET WITH NO IDP IMPACTS) REVEAL DELTA18O #tilde# -200 TO -300  RELATIVE TO SMOW. SUCH A LARGEDEPLETION IN 18O IS CONSISTENT WITH DIFFUSIVE SEPARATION OF O ISOTOPES ABOVE THE TERRESTRIAL HOMOPAUSE (#tilde#100 KM). THE NOISE LEVEL OF THESE MEASUREMENTS WAS HIGH DUE TO THE LOW COUNT RATES. WE EXPECT THAT THE HIGHER COUNT RATES FROM THE ION MICROPROBE WILL YIELD BETTER SIGNAL TO NOISE. IN ADDITION TO DETERMINING THE OXYGEN ISOTOPE COMPOSITION OF EARTHS UPPER ATMOSPHERE, THIS WORK MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR ESCAPE OF OXYGEN FROM MARS.

THE LACK OF AN OXIDE LAYER IN THE AU TARGETS MAY MAKE ANALYSIS OF THEM DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE, SINCE THE PENETRATION DEPTH OF 8 KM/S O ATOMS IS EXPECTED TO BEVERY SHALLOW.3.

WITH SUCH A LARGE AMOUNT OF MASS IT SEEMS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT THESE NOW-EXTINCT POPULATIONS OF IMPACTORS SHOULD HAVE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM, MUCH AS NOW-EXTINCT RADIONUCLIDES PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE THERMAL HISTORIES OF SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES. ONE OF THE MOST OBVIOUS EFFECTS OF RE-IMPACTING DEBRIS IS THE PRODUCTION OF CRATERS. THE MOON, MARS, MERCURY AND THE LARGEST ASTEROIDS MAY BE EXPECTED TO DISPLAY EVIDENCE OF RE-IMPACTING BOMBARDMENTS IN THEIR CRATER RECORD, SUBJECT TO THEIR THERMAL STATE AND SUBSEQUENT SURFACE RE-PROCESSING. HOWEVER, IN UNDERSTANDING THE CRATERING HISTORY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM, THE CONTRIBUTION OF GIANT IMPACT DEBRIS HAS BEEN ALMOST UNIVERSALLY NEGLECTED, AND CONSTRAINING THIS CONTRIBUTION CONSTITUTES OUR PRIMARY TASK. IN ADDITION TO THE PRODUCTION OF SURFACE CRATERS, LARGE IMPACTS CAN PUNCH THROUGH THE LITHOSPHERE AND EXHUME MATERIAL FROM LARGE DEPTHS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY PERTINENT FOR RE-IMPACTS ONTO A PROGENITOR BODY WHICH WILL HAVE A DEEP MAGMA OCEAN AFTER THE GIANT IMPACT. DEPENDING ON THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF THE TARGET, THIS MAGMA OCEAN MAY FORM A FLOTATION CRUST AS ON THE MOON AND PERHAPS MERCURY, THAT WOULD ACT AS AN INSULATING BLANKET. IMPACTORS THAT PUNCH THROUGH OR DISRUPT THIS CRUST MAY ALLOW THE MAGMA OCEAN TO COOL FASTER. CONVERSELY, FOR MAGMA OCEANS THAT FREEZE FROM THE BOTTOM UP, THE ENERGY INPUT FROM RE-IMPACTS MAY KEEP THEM LIQUID FOR LONGER. THIS FEEDS BACK INTO THE CRATERING RECORD AS CRATERS WILL ONLY BE RECORDED ONCE THERE IS A STABLE, SOLID SURFACE. IN THIS SENSE THE DYNAMICS OF GIANT IMPACT DEBRIS CAN IN PRINCIPLE BECOME A CHRONOMETER OF PLANETARY SOLIDIFICATION. THE INFLUENCE OF LONG TERM RE-ACCUMULATION ON PLANETARY THERMAL EVOLUTION IS OUR SECOND TASK. OUR THIRD TASK IS TO STUDY RE-IMPACTING DEBRIS AS AN ASPECT OF TERRESTRIAL SATELLITE FORMATION. THE MOON, PHOBOS AND DEIMOS LIKELY FORMED FROM CIRCUMPLANETARY DEBRIS DISKS. THESE DISKS DID NOT EXIST IN ISOLATION. THEY, AND THE SATELLITES THAT FORM FROM THEM, WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO RE-IMPACTS BY RETURNING DEBRIS FROM THEIR FORMATIVE GIANT IMPACTS. WHETHER SUCH DISK IMPACTS WOULD HAVE AIDED OR HINDERED SATELLITE FORMATION IS UNCLEAR."

TECTONIC ACTIVITY IS WIDESPREAD ON DIONE AND RHEA, WHILE TETHYS HAS LIMITED TECTONIC ACTIVITY, AND MIMAS HAS AN ANCIENT, HEAVILY CRATERED SURFACE, NEARLY DEVOID OF FRACTURES. HOWEVER, NO GLOBAL CATALOGUE OF TECTONIC FEATURES YET EXISTS FOR DIONE OR RHEA. THE SOURCE OF STRESS THAT CAUSED SUCH A DIVERSITY OF FRACTURING IS CURRENTLY UNKNOWN. OBSERVATIONS OF CRATER RELAXATION AND FLEXURE IMPLY A HIGHER HEAT FLOW ON DIONE AND RHEA THAN PREDICTED FROM CLASSIC MODELS OF THEIR FORMATION AND EVOLUTION. SUCH HIGH HEAT FLOWS MAY EVEN HAVE MAINTAINED SUBSURFACE OCEANS ON THESE MOONS, WHICH COULD HAVE ALLOWED ENHANCED TIDAL ACTIVITY AND, PERHAPS, TIDALLY-DRIVEN FRACTURING. NEW SATELLITE FORMATION MODELS HAVE DIFFERENT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EXTENT AND TIMING OF INTERNAL HEATING, THE PRESENCE OF AN OCEAN, AND THE PAST ORBITAL ECCENTRICITY OF THESE MOONS, ALL OF WHICH AFFECT TIDALLY-DRIVEN GEOLOGIC ACTIVITY. HOWEVER, THESE MODELS HAVE NOT YET BEEN TESTED AGAINST THE OBSERVED GEOLOGIC RECORDS OF DIONE AND RHEA. THE FIRST OBJECTIVE OF OUR PROPOSED WORK IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE TECTONIC RECORDS OF DIONE AND RHEA INCLUDE FRACTURES CAUSED BY ECCENTRICITY TIDES.

TO COMPLETE THESE OBJECTIVES, OUR FIRST TASK WILL BE MAPPING FRACTURES ON DIONE AND RHEA AND MEASURING THEIR ORIENTATIONS USING CASSINI ISS IMAGES. THEN, AS OUR SECOND TASK, WE WILL COMPUTE TIDAL STRESSES IN RHEOLOGICALLYLAYERED BODIES FOR A VARIETY OF ORBITAL-INTERIOR MODELS, INFORMED BY FORMATION MODELS. WE WILL INCLUDE INTERIOR STRUCTURES WITH AND WITHOUT OCEANS TO TEST THE INFERENCE OF OCEANS ON DIONE AND RHEA FROM CRATER RELAXATION AND FLEXURE MODELS AND TO CONSTRAIN THE EXTENT OF TIDAL ACTIVITY THAT CAN BE EXPECTED IN OCEAN-FREE SATELLITES. WE WILL ALSO TEST THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER ECCENTRICITIES IN ORDER TO CONSTRAIN ORBITAL EVOLUTION MODELS OF THE SATURNIAN SYSTEM THAT INVOKE SUCH SCENARIOS. OUR THIRD TASK WILL BE A STATISTICAL COMPARISON BETWEEN THE FRACTURE PATTERNS PREDICTED BY OUR TIDAL MODELS AND THE OBSERVED TECTONIC RECORDS OF DIONE AND RHEA. WE WILL USE THE OBSERVED FRACTURE ORIENTATIONS, GLOBAL PATTERN OF FRACTURING, AND TIDAL STRESS MAGNITUDES TO IDENTIFY THE MOST LIKELY ORBITAL-INTERIOR MODEL(S) FOR EACH MOON. FINALLY, WE WILL COMPARE RESULTS FOR BOTH MOONS, AS WELL AS PUBLISHED MODELS OF ENCELADUS AND MIMAS, TO DETERMINE THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE(S) OF THEIR VARYING SURFACE HISTORIES. THE POWER OF THE TIDAL-TECTONIC MODELING APPROACH, DEVELOPED BY OUR PROPOSAL TEAM, HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED AT EUROPA FOR SEVERAL TYPES OF TECTONIC FEATURES. IN RECENT YEARS, OUR TEAM HAS ADAPTED THESE METHODS TO ADDRESS VISCOELASTIC RHEOLOGIES AND VALIDATED OUR NUMERICAL TOOLS AGAINST RESULTS PUBLISHED FOR EUROPA. WE HAVE SINCE USED THESE TOOLS TO CONDUCT TIDAL-TECTONIC ANALYSES OF PLUTOS MOON, CHARON, AND SATURNS MOON, MIMAS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR PROPOSED WORK RELIES ON THESE PUBLISHED AND VALIDATED METHODS. OUR PROPOSED WORK WILL CHARACTERIZE THE TECTONIC ACTIVITY OF SATURNS MID-SIZED ICY MOONS, CONSTRAIN THE RHEOLOGY AND ORBITAL HISTORIES OF DIONE AND RHEA, AND ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF PAST LIQUID WATER OCEANS WITHIN THESE MOONS. HENCE, THIS WORK HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ORBITAL EVOLUTION OF THE ENTIRE SATURNIAN SYSTEM AND THE EXTENT OF HABITABLE ENVIRONMENTS IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM.

IT IS PRESENTLY NOT KNOWN WHETHER THE EVOLUTION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS WAS A FLUKE OF BIOCHEMISTRY OR WHETHER IT WAS ENABLED BY GEOCHEMICAL CHANGES THAT PRECEDED ITS EMERGENCE. THE INTACT GEOLOGIC RECORD IN ANCIENT ROCKS MAY EXTEND BACK TO TIMES WHEN THERE WAS NO PHOTOSYNTHESIS ON EARTH, BUT RESEARCHERS DO NOT YET KNOW WHAT EVIDENCE TO SEEK TO PIN DOWN THE HISTORICAL RECORD OF WHEN AND HOW PHOTOSYNTHESIS BEGAN.

THE ROLE OF MICROBES IN MEDIATING THE PRECIPITATION OF HYDROTHERMAL SILICA DEPOSITS IS STILL A DEVELOPING AREA OF STUDY. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO EVALUATE THE ROLE OF MICROBES IN SILICEOUS HOT SPRING DEPOSITS FOUND AT THE EL TATIO GEOTHERMAL FIELD IN THE ATACAMA DESERT OF NORTHERN CHILE. THIS LOCATION, AT AN ELEVATION OF 4300 M, IS UNIQUE IN HAVING SALINE SPRINGS THAT PRECIPITATE MICRO-DIGITATE FORMS COMPOSED OF OPALINE SILICA ENCRUSTED IN HALITE, MINERALS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO CAPTURE AND PRESERVE A MICROBIAL FOSSIL RECORD. MOST IMPORTANTLY IN THE PRESENT CONTEXT, THESE DEPOSITS PROVIDE THE BEST-KNOWN MORPHOLOGIC AND SPECTRAL ANALOG FOR THE OPALINE SILICA OUTCROPS DISCOVERED WITH THE SPIRIT ROVER AT HOME PLATE IN GUSEV CRATER. OUR GOAL IS TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL BIOGENICITY AND PRESERVATION POTENTIAL OF THE MICRO-DIGITATE SILICA STRUCTURES SEEN IN OUTCROPS AT HOME PLATE USING DETAILED CHARACTERIZATION AND COMPARISONS TO THE STRUCTURES AT EL TATIO. METHODS/TECHNIQUES WE WILL CONDUCT FIELDWORK AT EL TATIO AND AT A SECOND SITE IN PERU (CALIENTES) INTENDED TO CHARACTERIZE THE DIVERSITY AND FORMATION CONDITIONS OF THE MICRO-DIGITATE SILICA STRUCTURES AND EXPAND OUR SAMPLE SUITE.

HARDWARE COMPONENTS, SUCH AS BATTERIES, TRANSMITTERS, ETC. WILL ONLY OPERATE WITHIN A COMPARATIVELY SMALLER RANGE OF TEMPERATURES. THEREFORE A THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (TMS) MUST BE DEVELOPED TO MAINTAIN THE SPACECRAFT''S TEMPERATURE AT AN OPERABLE LEVEL THROUGHOUT THE MISSION. ONE FUNCTION OF THE TMS IS TO REGULATE THE SPACECRAFT''S RADIATIVE HEAT TRANSFER WITH THE ENVIRONMENT. PASSIVE RADIATION COATINGS ARE A DESIRABLE WAY TO ACHIEVE THIS SINCE THEY REQUIRE NO ELECTRICAL INPUT AND TYPICALLY ADD A NEGLIGIBLE AMOUNT OF MASS. THIS PROPOSAL DISCUSSES WAVELENGTH-SELECTIVE, TEMPERATURE-MODULATED MULTILAYER COATINGS WHICH CAN BE USED TO CONTROL THE RADIATIVE HEAT TRANSFER BETWEEN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE SPACECRAFT. IF THE SPACECRAFT''S TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH, THE RADIATION COATING CAN HELP TO REDUCE THE TEMPERATURE THROUGH ENHANCED THERMAL EMISSION BY SELECTIVELY EMITTING IN THE MID-INFRARED. CONVERSELY, IF THE SPACECRAFT TEMPERATURE IS TOO LOW, A HIGHLY REFLECTIVE RADIATION COATING CAN PREVENT FURTHER TEMPERATURE DECREASE BY MINIMIZING THERMAL LOSS. THE PROPOSED COATINGS WILL COMBINE BOTH FUNCTIONALITIES TO PROVIDE TEMPERATURE-MODULATED VARIABLE EMISSIVITY AND IMPROVED THERMAL CONTROL. THE TEMPERATURE-MODULATED PROPERTIES ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE INCORPORATION OF A THERMOCHROMIC TRANSITION MATERIAL, VANADIUM DIOXIDE. CURRENTLY A FABRY-PEROT RESONANCE CAVITY PROVIDES THE WAVELENGTH-SELECTIVITY OF THE DESIGN, HOWEVER OTHER STRUCTURES SUCH AS NANOPARTICLE LAYERS, GRATINGS, AND NANOPILLARS, WILL BE INVESTIGATED.

WE WILL WORK WITH SIERRA LOBO TO MODEL THE EXPECTED TEMPERATURE OF THE RECEIVER SYSTEMS WE DEVELOP WHEN COMBINED WITH THEIR CRYOCUBE TECHNOLOGY. WE WILL THEN CHARACTERIZE THE RECEIVERS AT THAT TEMPERATURE IN A LABORATORY CRYOSTAT TO QUANTIFY THE PERFORMANCE GAIN DELIVERED BY PASSIVE COOLING. THE RESULTING RECEIVER SYSTEMS COULD BE USED ON CUBESAT PLATFORMS FOR EARTH OBSERVING, PLANETARY SCIENCE OR ASTROPHYSICS AT EITHER AMBIENT TEMPERATURE OR PASSIVELY COOLED FOR IMPROVED NOISE PERFORMANCE.

We propose to do this by reproducing spacecraft observations with a three-dimensional numerical model. We specifically propose to address the importance of subsurface water reservoirs (compared to the seasonal and north residual caps), cloud processes, and atmospheric transport. Using a range of physical process parameterizations and an ensemble of model dynamical cores, it is our objective to explore, understand, and remove some of the model-to-model uncertainty inherent in water cycle studies to date. This project is of significance to the planetary atmospheres program because it addresses one of the most important questions in Martian (climate) science: how is the abundance of water on Mars controlled? We seek to further address the followina auestions:how much of the current uncertainty is due to the representation of transport and dynamics?""; ""how important is the regolith water reservoir on diurnal and seasonal time scales?""; ""how important are cloud-radiative-dynamical interactions for the water cycle?""; ""what scope is there for interannual variations in the water cycle given observed variability in atmospheric dust (in southern spring and summer) and surface albedo?"""""

We will use theories of dune formation to predict bedform orientations based on modeled winds at different resolutions, dust loadings and orbital configurations, and compare these and other predicted dune properties with observations of active and inactive dune fields on Mars.  Dunes haves been observed on Mars since the Mariner 9 mission in the early 1970s. In the last few years, high-resolution imaging by instruments such as THEMIS and HiRISE have provided unprecendented detail of dunes and dunefields. As dunes are aeolian (wind-driven) features, they provide a means to access the near-surface circulation, which has only been measured at a handful of locations on Mars, and for a complete annual cycle at only two locations (the Viking Lander 1 and 2 sites). The mere existence of dunes implies winds that are strong enough to transport sediment, their morphology (the dune type) indicates the directional variability of the wind regime, and their orientations provide information about the long-term wind direction. The bedform orientation of most dune types does not uniquely imply the dominant or average wind direction, however we will use an approach that is novel for Mars and will predict dune orientations given our modeled long-term wind field, using the gross bedform-normal transport (GBNT) approach of Rubin and Hunter [1987]. By comparing predicted and observed orientation, we can thus assess the validity of our model winds. We will use global and mesoscale numerical models of the Martian atmosphere, for a range of dust loadings during the storm season, and for a range of orbital configurations, to produce predictions of sand flux, DCA and dune orientations (applying the GBNT approach to the annual cycle of wind data) for the entire planet at low resolution and for four selected study regions at high resolution.  These will be compared to observations of respectively dune locations, DCA and slipface orientations (or other measures of dune orientation). If they agree, we can have more confidence in the validity of our modeled wind field for present day Mars. Given the important role of local scale topography we expect disagreement in many regions when using only the global model, and will use the mesoscale model to assess whether a finer resolution allows us to capture the dune-forming flows. Another reason for disagreement would be an incorrect choice of saltation threshold, and by tuning this to better match the observations we will obtain estimates of the saltation threshold on Mars itself. A third reason would be a strong dependence of the dune-forming winds on dust loading during the storm season, so we will also produce results for different dust storm conditions. A fourth reason would be a strong dependence of the dune-forming winds on Mars's orbital configuration, particularly with dunes judged to be inactive in the present wind regime, so we will also produce results for different obliquities and timing of perihelion. By performing the proposed work we will thus (1) produce estimates of the saltation threshold on Mars, (2) examine the importance of using the gross bedform-normal transport (GBNT) approach over a full annual cycle to predict dune orientations, and compare this with the previous method of inferring dominant winds based on certain dune morphologies and bedform orientations, (3) assess the validity of our modeled wind fields on global and regional scales, and (4) examine the impact of changes in (a) dust loading and (b) Mars's orbital configuration on the dune-forming circulation.  This proposal addresses NASA Strategic Goal 3, specifically, 3C. The proposal is highly relevant to the MFRP program, as by investigating the coupled atmospheric and geological systems on Mars we will address Mars Exploration Program goals 2A, 2B and 3A."

IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE PROPOSE TO USE ADVANCES IN COMPUTING POWER AND MODEL DEVELOPMENT TO EMPLOY NESTED SYNOPTIC-TO-MESOSCALE MODELING OF CLOUD SYSTEMS AND MOIST CONVECTION USING MASSIVELY PARALLEL COMPUTING. CRUCIALLY, WE PROPOSE TO FOCUS THE EFFORT ON WELL DOCUMENTED \GREAT WHITE SPOT\"" (GWS) CONVECTIVE CLOUD SYSTEMS ON SATURN. NOT ONLY IS THE MORPHOLOGICAL EVOLUTION OF THESE STORMS WELL OBSERVED USING IMAGING, BUT THERMAL AND TRACE PROCESS DATA EXIST FROM THERMAL OBSERVATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, PARA/ORTHO HYDROGEN OBSERVATIONS PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT CONSTRAINTS ON THE DISTRIBUTION AND VIGOR OF MOIST CONVECTION. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO UNDERSTAND THE PHYSICAL PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH CONVECTIVE STORMS AND THE DYNAMICAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN STORMS AND THE LARGE-SCALE DYNAMICS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE MOIST CONVECTION SCHEME THAT CHARACTERIZES THE WATER AND AMMONIA CLOUD DYNAMICS ON SATURN AND JUPITER AND INVESTIGATE THE FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF CONVECTIVE STORMS AT VARIOUS SCALES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH A NUMERICAL SCHEME WITHIN GLOBAL MODELS IS A CRITICAL PREREQUISITE FOR MAKING FURTHER PROGRESS ON UNDERSTANDING THE GENERAL CIRCULATION OF THE GAS GIANT ATMOSPHERES. WE PROPOSE TO USE IMAGING AND INFRARED OBSERVATIONS FROM CASSINI IN COMBINATION WITH OUR PLANETWRF MODEL TO EXAMINE MOIST CONVECTION, AND SPECIFICALLY THE WELL DOCUMENTED GWS TEST CASE, ON CLOUD RESOLVING SCALES AND ALSO THEIR INTERACTION WITH LARGER-SCALE FLOWS. THE NESTED CLOUD-RESOLVING TO GLOBAL SCALE CAPABILITY OF PLANETWRF MAKES IT A UNIQUELY CAPABLE MODEL IN THIS APPLICATION. THE RESULTS FROM THE USE OF PLANETWRF TO SYNTHESIZE AND GENERALIZED OBSERVATIONS OF MOIST CONVECTION WILL BE USED TO FORMULATE SIMPLIFIED PLUME MODELS OF MOIST CONVECTION THAT CAN BE INCLUDED IN PURELY GLOBAL MODELS OF INSUFFICIENT RESOLUTION TO DIRECTLY CAPTURE THESE PROCESSES. THE GENERAL CIRCULATION OF GAS GIANT ATMOSPHERES IS A MAJOR SCIENCE FOCUS FOR NASA, BOTH IN TERMS OF THE GAS GIANTS IN OUR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM, BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF GAS GIANT DYNAMICS FOR UNDERSTANDING EXTRA-SOLAR PLANETS."""

THEORETICAL, ANALYTICAL OR SIMPLIFIED (E.G. 2D) MODELS PROVIDE A POWERFUL MEANS OF INVESTIGATING SPECIFIC PHENOMENA IN TITAN''S ATMOSPHERE, AND ENABLE HYPOTHESES TO BE FORMED CONCERNING THE RELEVANT MECHANISMS AT WORK. HOWEVER, REAL ATMOSPHERES ARE COMPLICATED BY THREE DIMENSIONAL PROCESSES, NON-LINEAR INTERACTIONS, AND NUMEROUS FEEDBACKS. THREE-DIMENSIONAL GENERAL CIRCULATION MODELS (GCMS) PROVIDE AN INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK FOR CAPTURING THE LINEAR AND NON-LINEAR INTERACTIONS OF A WIDE RANGE OF PROCESSES, AND ARE THUS REQUIRED TO TEST AND FURTHER DEVELOP HYPOTHESES, TO STUDY THE COMPLETE ATMOSPHERIC SYSTEM, AND TO SIMULATE (AND EVENTUALLY PREDICT) ALL ASPECTS OF THE TIME-VARYING 3D ATMOSPHERE. DESPITE THEIR USEFULNESS, HOWEVER, GCMS (AND PARTICULARLY PLANETARY GCMS) CONTAIN MANY UNKNOWN OR POORLY KNOWN ASSUMPTIONS AND PARAMETERS. A TITAN GCM THEREFORE CANNOT HOPE TO PROPERLY REPRESENT ITS INTENDED ATMOSPHERE UNTIL IT HAS BEEN CONFRONTED WITH SUFFICIENT OBSERVATIONS TO CONSTRAIN THESE PROPERLY, AND IT CAN ''SIMULTANEOUSLY'' (BY WHICH WE MEAN ''WITHIN A SINGLE SIMULATION'') MATCH MULTI-INSTRUMENT OBSERVATIONS OF DISPARATE VARIABLES AND FEATURES. IN THIS WORK WE PROPOSE TO CONSTRAIN OUR EXISTING THREE-DIMENSIONAL GCM   TITANWRF   IN THE THREE AREAS DESCRIBED ABOVE. FOR (1) WE WILL DEVELOP AN OBSERVATION SYSTEM SIMULATION EXPERIMENT FOR THE CASSINI CIRS INSTRUMENT, USING IT TO COMPARE CIRS RADIANCES WITH TITANWRF PREDICTIONS, AND TO ASSESS WHETHER OBSERVATIONS SUPPORT THE EXISTENCE AND NATURE OF THE WAVE DRIVEN ANGULAR MOMENTUM ''TRANSFER EVENTS'' THAT ARE KEY TO PRODUCING STRATOSPHERIC SUPERROTATION IN TITANWRF. FOR (2) WE WILL ADD NEW PARAMETERIZATIONS OF METHANE CYCLE PROCESSES (INCLUDING MOIST CONVECTION AND SUB-SURFACE DIFFUSION) AND VARY TITANWRF''S PHYSICAL PARAMETERS, WITH THE AIM OF PRODUCING THE BEST MATCH TO THE OBSERVED METHANE CYCLE. FOR (3) WE WILL USE REALISTIC TOPOGRAPHY TO PREDICT GLOBAL AND MESOSCALE DUNE CHARACTERISTICS BASED ON THE LONG-TERM WIND FIELD, PROVIDING AN INDIRECT BUT RIGOROUS MEANS OF TESTING THE NEAR-SURFACE ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION PREDICTED BY TITANWRF, CONSTRAINING THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE WINDS (FROM SURFACE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS TO PHYSICAL PROCESSES), AND INVESTIGATING MECHANISMS BEHIND THE OBSERVED CHARACTERISTICS OF TITAN''S DUNES. AS WE REQUIRE TITANWRF TO SIMULTANEOUSLY MATCH OBSERVATIONS IN ALL THREE AREAS, RESULTS OF EACH INVESTIGATION WILL GUIDE WORK IN THE OTHERS, AND OUTPUT FROM OUR EVENTUAL ''MOST REALISTIC'' GCM ENCAPSULATING OUR BEST UNDERSTANDING OF TITAN WILL BE MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE VIA THE PLANETARY DATA SYSTEM (PDS) FOR WIDER COMMUNITY USE."

As shown by helioseismic studies, the zonal and the meridional flow in the upper convection zone vary with the solar cycle. The variation of these flows associated with the new cycle has been detected before any magnetic activity of cycle 24 was present on the surface of the sun. The high-resolution observations available from SDO/HMI allow us to measure these large-scale flows at a great distance from disk center. Sub-surface flows derived from previous observations have been limited to about 60 degrees latitude, while they can be measured to at least 75 degrees using SDO, which is a substantial improvement. For the meridional flow, we will address the question whether there are multiple cells per hemisphere, which is of great importance for flux-transport dynamos. Second, we propose to derive the variation with depth in order to validate hints of multiple cells in depth. For the zonal flow and its cycle variation, we will focus on the poleward branch of this pattern in addition to the equatorward one. The cycle variations of the zonal and the meridional flow are usually studied separately. We propose to treat both flow components as part of a single system. How are these flow variations related to each other? Is their timing the same with regard to the activity cycle? We plan to pursue the proposed goals with multiple techniques and data sets. Local and global helioseismic techniques will be applied to HMI Dopplergrams. The ring-diagram analysis will be used to derive subsurface flows in the upper shear layer of the convection zone, while the time-distance analysis will be used to derive the meridional flow in the deeper convection zone. Global helioseismology will be used to derive the zonal flow throughout the whole  convection zone. Comparing zonal flows derived from global as well as local techniques allows us to cross-validate the results."

The International Astronomical Union has proclaimed 2009 the International Year of Astronomy (IYA), in recognition of the continuing legacy of Galileo's initial observations - and the accompanying opportunity to spread interest in astronomy's contributions to science and culture. The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) propose to bring the NASA Science Mission Directorate's (SMD) contributions to the story of astronomical observation and discovery to communities across the nation through an IYA-themed traveling exhibition designed for libraries and the formal and informal science education audiences that they serve. By providing free and convenient access to educational materials and programs, libraries play an important role in nurturing a lifelong journey of discovery for both children and adults. The IYA presents a unique impetus for libraries to incorporate NASA content and expertise into these offerings. STScI and the SAO will develop and disseminate the traveling exhibition in partnership with the American Library Association (ALA). The proposed effort leverages existing STScI, SAO, and ALA expertise, and includes: 1) IYA-themed exhibit panels; 2) accompanying educational resource collections that invite further learning and discovery; 3) coordinated speaking opportunities that connect local scientists - and their stories - to the youth and families in their communities; 4) professional development for librarians and scientists; 5) formative and summative evaluation. As few NASA E/PO programs target libraries, the proposed work will extend NASA SMD resources to new audiences. The ALA connection also provides a unified approach to reaching and leaving a lasting legacy with formal and informal science education audiences."

SEDNA&#039;S CLOSEST APPROACH AS IT ORBITS THE SUN IS A PERIHELION OF 76 AU, FAR BEYOND THE 30 AU - 50 AU REGION INHABITED BY OVER 1,000 KNOWN KUIPER BELT OBJECTS (KBOS), NEPTUNE AND PLUTO. ITS EXTREME ORBIT IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER BOUND SOLAR SYSTEM OBJECT AS IT TRAVELS FROM 76 AU TO NEARLY 1,000 AU, NEVER VENTURING NEAR THE KUIPER BELT. WE SEEK FUNDING TO DISCOVER MORE SEDNA-LIKE OBJECTS USING GROUND-BASED TELESCOPES IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE BASIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS UNUSUAL POPULATION, WHICH MAY RIVAL THE KBOS IN TOTAL NUMBERS. THE KBOS ARE THOUGHT TO BE THE MOST PRIMITIVE BODIES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM DUE TO THEIR EXTREME DISTANCE. THEY MAY BE REMNANTS FROM THE PLANET FORMING ERA THAT HAVE BEEN STORED IN AN EXTREMELY COLD (&lt;40 KELVIN) ENVIRONMENT SINCE THE PLANET FORMING ERA. ALL KNOWN KBOS TRAVEL CLOSER TO THE SUN THAN ABOUT 50 AU. IT IS THOUGHT THAT SEDNA MAY BE THE FIRST KNOWN AND BEST EXAMPLE OF A TRANSITION CLASS OF OBJECTS BETWEEN THE KBOS AND THE VERY DISTANT OORT CLOUD BODIES AT ROUGHLY 10,000 AU. BECAUSE OF THE OORT CLOUD&#039;S EXTREME DISTANCE (AND THUS, FAINTNESS), IT WILL NOT OBSERVABLE IN OUR LIFETIMES. HOWEVER, ITS PRESENCE IS INFERRED FROM THE LONG-PERIOD COMETS. THUS, BY DISCOVERING MORE SEDNA-LIKE BODIES, WE CAN PUT CONSTRAINTS ON THE OORT CLOUD, AN UNSEEN POPULATION EJECTED FROM THE SOLAR SYSTEM DURING THE PLANET FORMING ERA. SEDNA&#039;S ORBIT MAY PROVIDE US WITH OTHER CLUES TO THE EARLY SOLAR ENVIRONMENT. CURRENT THEORIES SUGGEST THAT SUCH AN EXTREME ORBIT COULD BE PRODUCED BY A CLOSE PASSAGE BETWEEN OUR SUN AND ANOTHER STAR. SUCH AN EVENT COULD ONLY HAPPEN IN THE EARLY SOLAR ENVIRONMENT WHEN THE SUN WAS STILL PRESENT IN ITS BIRTH CLUSTER. THUS, SEDNA&#039;S ORBIT MAY GIVE US CLUES TO THE VERY ANCIENT SOLAR SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT. THE SEARCH FOR OTHER SEDNAS IS DIRECTLY ALIGNED WITH THE FOLLOWING THREE OBJECTIVES OF NASA&#039;S SCIENCE GOALS FOR PLANETARY SCIENCE: 1) INVENTORY SOLAR SYSTEM OBJECTS AND IDENTIFY THE PROCESSES ACTIVE IN AND AMONG THEM CLEARLY, IF THE SEDNA-LIKE BODIES COMPRISE A NEW POPULATION WITHIN THE SOLAR SYSTEM, IT MUST BE INVENTORIED. THIS POSSIBLE TRANSITION POPULATION IS A SET OF OBSERVABLE BODIES BETWEEN TWO DISTINCT POPULATIONS: (A) THE KBOS, WHICH ARE WELL-STUDIED AND (B) THE OORT CLOUD BODIES. 2) UNDERSTAND HOW THE SUN&#039;S FAMILY OF PLANETS, SATELLITES, AND MINOR BODIES ORIGINATED AND EVOLVED A POPULATION OF SEDNAS MAY CONTAIN TRACE INDICATORS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM&#039;S HISTORY SUCH AS CLOSE ENCOUNTERS WITH THE NASCENT SUN&#039;S BIRTH GROUP OF STARS. IN ADDITION, THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SEDNA-LIKE BODIES COULD REPRESENT THE LEAST THERMALLY ALTERED MATERIAL IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 3) UNDERSTAND THE PROCESSES THAT DETERMINE THE HISTORY AND FUTURE OF HABITABILITY OF ENVIRONMENTS ON MARS AND OTHER SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT THE SEDNA POPULATION CONTAINS MARS-SIZED BODIES. A MARS-SIZED BODY AT 400 AU WITH A REFLECTIVITY OF 15% (SIMILAR TO THE KBOS) WOULD HAVE AN APPARENT BRIGHTNESS OF ABOUT R=24 MAGNITUDES, WHICH WOULD BE WELL WITHIN OUR SURVEY DETECTION LIMIT. SUCH A BODY WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO BE FOUND IN PREVIOUS SURVEYS BECAUSE OF THE FAINTNESS OF THE BODY AND ITS EXTREME DISTANCE (I.E. SLOW APPARENT MOTION), OR BOTH. OUR PRIMARY TOOLS FOR THIS SURVEY WILL BE WIDE FIELD 4 TO 10 METER CLASS TELESCOPES. OUR SURVEY WILL BE CONDUCTED IN A MANNER THAT IS SENSITIVE TO THE MOST DISTANT OBJECTS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM, TARGETING BODIES THAT RANGE FROM 60 AU OUT TO 1000 AU. OUR TEAM HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE CONDUCTING SIMILAR SURVEYS TO SUCCESSFULLY SEARCH FOR KUIPER BELT OBJECTS, NEPTUNE TROJANS AND OTHER SMALL BODY POPULATIONS. BY USING NOVEL SEARCH STRATEGIES, WE WILL PROVIDE A UNIQUE DATA SET THAT IS SENSITIVE TO THE MOST DISTANT AND UNUSUAL MINOR BODIES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM, THE SEDNA-LIKE BODIES."

MAST provides public access to 13 missions, three of which (HST, GALEX, and XMM-OM) are actively acquiring new science data, with another, Kepler, scheduled for launch next year. The role of MAST extends beyond the archive basics of providing storage of and user-friendly access to these data. The rapid improvement in interoperability protocols, web services, and information technologies, coupled with the increase in the quantity, quality, and consistency of astronomical data, have largely eliminated the artificial barriers that once partitioned astronomy according to wavelength regimes and techniques. In the past 4 years we have seen many enhancements to interoperability, leading up to the current planned transition to the operational phase of the Virtual Astrophysical Observatory. Our vision is to ensure the continued growth of seamless inter-archive access and collaboration for the scientific benefit of our user community and to maximize the return on the investment made by the U.S. public in our space astrophysics.   The 75 Terabyte MAST data archive is one of the most significant astronomical collections available today. The scientific value of MAST comes from the varied astrophysical phenomena that dominate the optical/UV regions of the electromagnetic spectrum and from the user-friendly implementation of its archive user interfaces. The utility of MAST missions is demonstrated by the publication rate of-875 scientific papers per year that make substantial use of these data. The primary World Wide Web user interface to MAST enables users to search our databases, retrieve data, download mission documentation and analysis software, seek answers to analysis/archive questions, and cross-correlate our holdings with those at other NASA data-centers or with user-provided catalogs. The innovative GALEX science archive interface has many advanced features that allow users to realize the full scientific potential often this unique all-sky survey.   The new Hubble Legacy Archive (HLA) project aims to revolutionize Hubble archival research by creating advanced, science-ready HST data products (stored online for immediate access) with powerful and flexible user interfaces that enable rapid exploration of our archive holdings in the wider context of the Virtual Observatory. The HLA is leading the way toward the next generation of archival interfaces and high-level science products for MAST and the Virtual Observatory."

DOZENS OF CANDIDATES PER YEAR WILL BE SCRUTINIZED WITH MODERATE-PRECISION (1 KM/S) RADIAL VELOCITY OBSERVATIONS AND A FEW OF THOSE WILL BE CONFIRMED TO BE PLANETS WITH (5 M/S) PRECISION. WE WILL PURSUE PRECISE PHOTOMETRIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC FOLLOW UP OBSERVATIONS OF TRANSITING PLANETS. OUR TEAM HAS PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH SCINTILLATION-LIMITED GROUND-BASED PHOTOMETRY, TIME-SERIES PHOTOMETRY WITH SST IRAC, SPECTROPHOTOMETRY WITH HST INSTRUMENTS NICMOS, STIS, FGS, ACS, AND WFC3 (IN GROUND-TESTS), AND IS DEVELOPING SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES TO IMPROVE THE PRECISION OF RADIAL VELOCITIES FROM THE HET AND KECK. USING RADIAL VELOCITIES AND PHOTOMETRY WE WILL SEARCH FOR ADDITIONAL COMPANIONS AROUND STARS KNOWN TO HOST A TRANSITING PLANET. FOR THE PERIOD 2003-2009, THE XO TEAM HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY TWO NASA ORIGINS AWARDS. FOLLOW-UP OBSERVATIONS WITH HST AND SST HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED BY THOSE NASA PROGRAMS. THE TRIPLING OF XO''S CAMERAS AND ASSOCIATED ELECTRONICS HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY PEER-REVIEWED COMPETITION FOR INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS OF THE STSCI DIRECTOR."

NRM enables the highest angular resolution science possible given the telescope's diameter and operating wavelength. It also provides precise information on a telescope's optical state. NRM relies on its high quality self-calibration properties and the robustness of interferometric techniques, whereas coronagraphy requires exquisite wavefront quality. Stability during an observation sets fundamental NRM contrast limits. A non-redundant mask was recently added to JWST's Fine Guidance Sensor Tunable Filter Imager (FGS TFJ) instrument, bringing a no-cost, no impact boost in angular resolution that complements JWST's coronagraphs. The JWST NR.1 search space lies between SO and 400 mas at 3.8 to 5 microns, even in the telescope's image quality does not meet requirements. JWST's NRM will produce 10 magnitudes of contrast in a 10 ks exposure on an M=7 star, placing Taurus protoplanets and nearby Jovians younger than 300 Myr within JWST's reach. Future space telescopes can improve vastly on JWST's NRt l by utilizing more refined observing methods, and instrumentation designed to take full advantage of NRM's high dynamic range, high contrast capabilities. The ATLAST 16 m segmented primary design can deliver to 12 magnitudes of contrast between 0.7 to 6 mas at 0.1 microns. On an 8 m telescope at O.t micron NRM resolution is almost ten times better than ALMA's finest resolution. Polarization with space-based NRM opens new vistas of astrophysics in planetary system and star formation as well as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and structure around Galactic Black Hole Candidates, with miUiarsecond resolution at 10 or more magnitudes of photometric dynamic range. Space NRM explores areas inaccessible to both JWST coronagraphs and future 30-m class ground-based telescopes. Ground-based NRM is limited by atmospheric variability. Optimization of space-based NRM requires consideration of flat fielding accuracy, target placement repeatability, charge diffusion, intrapixel sensitivity, image persistence, charge transfer efficiency, guilding, wavefront stability, and pupil wander. We propose to assess NRM limits realistically to understand the science yield and technological utility of NRM in space, and, simultaneously, develop NRM science for planet and star formation and extragalactic science in the UV -NIR, to help steer high resolution space based astronomy in the coming decade."

The second issue concerns the effects of rapid radial disk structural variations on planet migration by means of 3D simulations. We intend to determine the conditions required for substantial migration slowing by these effects. The third topic deals with the interaction of eccentric orbit planets with disks. We wish to determine the flow pattern near an eccentric orbit planet, the nature of the reduced or outward torque that sometimes occurs, and continue our investigations of whether planet eccentricity can grow through planet-disk interactions. This analysis will be carried out by the use of two independent simulation codes and analytic modeling."

THE DISCOVERY OF A RICH CHEMISTRY IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS VIA A FOREST OF STRONG 3-40 MICRON MOLECULAR EMISSION LINES (H2O, OH, CO2, HCN, C2H2,...) ALLOWS US FOR THE FIRST TIME TO INVESTIGATE CHEMICAL DIVERSITY IN OTHER PLANET-FORMING ENVIRONMMENTS (SALYK ET AL. 2008; CARR&amp;NAJITA 2008). FURTHER EFFORTS, SUPPORTED BY THE ORIGINS PROGRAM, HAS ESTABLISHED THAT THIS MOLECULAR FOREST IS SEEN IN THE DISKS SURROUNDING MOST YOUNG SOLAR-TYPE STARS (PONTOPPIDAN ET AL. 2010).  WE PROPOSE A 3-YEAR PROGRAM TO ANALYZE OUR GROWING MULTI-WAVELENGTH DATABASE OF OBSERVATIONS OF WATER, OH AND ORGANIC MOLECULES IN THE SURFACES OF PROTOPLANETARY DISKS. THE DATABASE INCLUDES HIGH (R#tilde#25,000-100,000) AND MEDIUM RESOLUTION (R#tilde#600-3000) 3-200 MICRON SPECTRA FROM A WIDE RANGE OF FACILITIES (KECK-NIRSPEC, VLT-CRIRES, SPITZER-IRS, VLT-VISIR, GEMINI-MICHELLE AND HERSCHEL-PACS).

THIS MAY BE DUE TO THE SETTLING OF ICY GRAINS AS PART OF THE FORMATION OF ICY  PLANETESIMALS (MEIJERINK ET AL. 2009; BERGIN ET AL. 2010). WE WISH TO QUANTIFY THE DEPLETION FACTOR AND ESTABLISH WHETHER THIS IS A COMMON PROPERTY OF ALL PROTOPLANETARY DISKS.  2)	WE WILL PURSUE CRITICAL NEW DATASETS USING UPCOMING OBSERVATIONAL FACILITIES, INCLUDING SPECTRALLY RESOLVED ROTATIONAL WATER LINES IN THE MID-INFRARED. VLT-VISIR, WITH WHICH WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DETECTED WATER LINES AT HIGH RESOLUTION, IS UNDERGOING A SIGNIFICANT HARDWARE UPGRADE WITH A PLANNED COMMISSIONING AROUND JANUARY 2012. THE UPGRADE INCLUDES A MUCH LARGER AND MORE SENSITIVE DETECTOR BASED ON TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED FOR JWST-MIRI, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE ITS EFFICIENCY BY 1-2 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE.

ONE POSSIBILITY IS THAT THE APPARENT GREAT ENERGIES OF THE LAT BURSTS, AS WELL AS THEIR PROLIFIC PRODUCTION OF HIGH-ENERGY PHOTONS, ARE DUE TO AN INTERACTION WITH AN UNUSUALLY TENUOUS MEDIUM.

ACHIEVING THIS AMBITIOUS GOAL WILL REQUIRE 1E-10 CONTRAST ON A TELESCOPE LARGE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE ANGULAR RESOLUTION AND SENSITIVITY TO PLANETS AROUND A SIGNIFICANT SAMPLE OF NEARBY STARS. SUCH A MISSION MUST OF COURSE ALSO BE REALIZED AT AN ACHIEVABLE COST. LIGHTWEIGHT SEGMENTED MIRROR TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS LARGER DIAMETER OPTICS TO FIT IN ANY GIVEN LAUNCH VEHICLE AS COMPARED TO MONOLITHIC MIRRORS, AND LOWERS TOTAL LIFE-CYCLE COSTS FROM CONSTRUCTION THROUGH INTEGRATION&TEST, MAKING IT A COMPELLING OPTION FOR FUTURE LARGE SPACE TELESCOPES. AT SMALLER SCALES, ON-AXIS DESIGNS WITH SECONDARY OBSCURATIONS AND SUPPORTS ARE LESS CHALLENGING TO FABRICATE AND THUS MORE AFFORDABLE THAN THE OFF-AXIS UNOBSCURED PRIMARY MIRROR DESIGNS ENVISIONED IN MANY PAST MISSION CONCEPT STUDIES. BUT UNTIL RECENTLY, IT WAS BELIEVED THAT INTERNAL CORONAGRAPHS WERE INCAPABLE OF YIELDING VERY HIGH CONTRAST ON SEGMENTED OR OBSCURED TELESCOPES. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS NOW SHOW THAT THERE IS IN FACT A CLEAR PATH TO HIGH CONTRAST CORONAGRAPHY ON SUCH APERTURES. FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS WE HAVE BEEN PURSUING HIGH CONTRAST IMAGING DEVELOPMENT FOR SEGMENTED TELESCOPES, SUPPORTED IN PART BY APRA (AWARD NNX12AG05G, ROSES 2011). THE ACAD ALGORITHM, DEVELOPED IN THE COURSE OF OUR CURRENT APRA, IN PRINCIPLE APPEARS TO ENABLE HIGH CONTRAST CORONAGRAPHY ON OBSCURED APERTURES AS WE SET OUT TO ACHIEVE. THE PRACTICAL LABORATORY DEMONSTRATION OF THIS NEW ALGORITHM NOW REQUIRES ADDITIONAL RESOURCES NOT FORESEEN AT THE TIME OF OUR PRIOR PROPOSAL. CHIEF OF THESE IS THE NEED FOR A SECOND BOSTON MICROMACHINES DEFORMABLE MIRROR. THE ACAD ALGORITHM RELIES ON THE CONVERSION OF PHASE TO AMPLITUDE AS LIGHT PROPAGATES BETWEEN TWO DEFORMABLE MIRRORS AT DIFFERING OPTICAL CONJUGATES; A SECOND DM IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO ITS LABORATORY DEMONSTRATION AND VALIDATION. WE PROPOSE NOW TO DEMONSTRATE THE ACAD ALGORITHM IN AIR AT A CONTRAST OF #tilde#1E-7 IN NARROW SPECTRAL BANDS, AND EXTEND THAT PERFORMANCE THROUGH DEVELOPMENT OF BROAD BAND #tilde# 20%) OPTIMIZATION METHODS. NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS A PROPER SUBSET OF AN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL SUBMITTED TO SAT-TDEM BY OUR TEAM THAT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL HIGHER TRL DEMONSTRATIONS."

FLARES ARE OFTEN SEEN AS A TUMULTUOUS BREAKUP OF A PREVIOUSLY STABLE CONFIGURATION LEADING TO RELEASE OF A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ENERGY, MATERIAL ERUPTION, PARTICLE ACCELERATION, AND RESTRUCTURING OF MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION. THIS MAGNETIC RESTRUCTURING MAY BE A KEY FOR UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSICS OF PROCESSES TAKING PLACE THROUGHOUT THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE IN RESPONSE TO FLARES: MAGNETIC FIELD SUPPLIES ENERGY TO FLARES, AND SERVES AS A TRIGGER AND AS A CONDUIT OF ENERGY TRANSPORT. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO INVESTIGATE THE MAGNETIC RESTRUCTURING ASSOCIATED WITH FLARES AND ITS EFFECTS ON THERMODYNAMIC PROCESSES IN THE LOW SOLAR ATMOSPHERE. THE CHANGES IN THE MAGNETIC FIELD WILL BE EVALUATED IN RESPECT TO TWO ALTERNATIVE MODELS: CORONAL IMPLOSION AND TWIST REMOVAL MODEL. EITHER OF THESE SCENARIOS MAY TAKE PLACE IN FLARES, BUT THE TWO MODELS CAN BE DISTINGUISHED BASED ON EXPECTED MAGNETIC FIELD CHANGES. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS BASED ON FULL VECTOR MAGNETIC FIELD DATA FROM TWO NASA MISSIONS, SDO AND HINODE, AND SUPPLEMENTED WITH OBSERVATIONS FROM TWO GROUND-BASED INSTRUMENTS, GONG (LINE-OF-SIGHT ONLY) AND SOLIS (VECTOR DATA). THESE TWO AUXILIARY DATA SETS WILL ENHANCE THE INTERPRETATION OF SDO DATA, STRENGTHEN THE STATISTICS. THE AUXILIARY DATA SETS COULD BE CRITICAL IN FINDING THE PROPER INTERPRETATION IN CASES WHEN THE MAGNETIC FIELD DERIVATIONS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE POOR SPECTRAL RESOLUTION OF HMI, OR HAMPERED BY THE POOR TEMPORAL CADENCE OF SOT/SP. THESE DATA SETS WILL ALSO ALLOW INCLUDING FLARES PRIOR TO SDO LAUNCH FOR GREATER STATISTICAL SAMPLE, IF NEEDED. SOLIS CA II 854.2 NM LINE-OF-SIGHT (LOS) MAGNETOGRAMS WILL EXPAND THE STUDY TO THE CHROMOSPHERE. USING SDO VECTOR MAGNETOGRAMS WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE CHANGES IN ORIENTATION AND STRENGTH OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD AND THE ASSOCIATED CHANGES IN LORENTZ FORCE. FOR SELECTED CASES, WE WILL ALSO DERIVE PSEUDO-VECTOR FIELDS USING HIGH-CADENCE SDO/HMI AND GONG LINE-OF-SIGHT (LOS) MAGNETOGRAMS BASED ON THE APPROACH OF AZIMUTHAL AVERAGING. EVOLUTION OF THE DERIVED PSEUDO-VECTOR FIELDS DURING FLARES WILL BE INVESTIGATED AND VALIDATED WITH THE RESULT FROM SDO/HMI VECTOR MAGNETOGRAMS. TO INVESTIGATE CHANGES IN THERMODYNAMIC PARAMETERS ASSOCIATED WITH FLARES, WE WILL USE EXISTING OBSERVATIONS OF FLARING REGIONS WITH THE STOKES POLARIMETER ON HINODE. IN ADDITION, WE WILL USE EXISTING FLARE OBSERVATIONS WITH SOLIS FOR A FEW SELECTED FLARES AND CONDUCT NEW OBSERVATIONS IF NEEDED. AS A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT, SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL SOLIS OBSERVATIONAL FLARE CAMPAIGNS WERE CONDUCTED IN THE PAST. THE USE OF SOLIS DATA WILL ENHANCE THE INTERPRETATION OF SDO/HMI SPECTRAL DATA AS SOLIS/VSM HAS HIGHER SPECTRAL SAMPLING AS COMPARED WITH SDO/HMI DATA. CHANGES IN THERMODYNAMIC PARAMETERS WILL SHOW THE EFFECT OF FLARES THROUGH THE FORMATION HEIGHT RANGE OF THE FE I 630.1-630.2 NM PHOTOSPHERIC AND CA I 854.2 NM CHROMOSPHERIC SPECTRAL LINES. FINALLY, WE WILL COMPARE THE LOCATION OF FOOTPOINTS OF FLARE LOOPS DERIVED FROM RHESSI OBSERVATIONS IN AN ENERGY RANGE OF 50-300 KEV WITH THE LOCATIONS THAT SHOW SIGNIFICANT TOPOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE MAGNETIC FIELD. WE WILL EXAMINE THE RATE OF FLUX LOSS IN THE RECONNECTION EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH FLARES. WE EXPECT THAT THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY WILL BRING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF PHYSICS OF FLARE PROCESSES IN ACTIVE REGIONS AND CONSTRAIN SOME EXISTING FLARE MODELS."

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE THEORETICAL NOISE LIMIT  AND THE CONFUSION LIMIT SUGGESTS THAT SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS CAN BE MADE WITH A MORE SOPHISTICATED TREATMENT OF SOURCE CONFUSION. THIS IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE HERSCHEL DEEP FIELDS FROM OTHER WAVELENGTHS.  THE PROJECT WILL USE EXISTING ALREADY-REDUCED DATA FROM HERSCHEL''S DEEPEST OBSERVATIONS, WHICH TARGETED THE CANDELS. THESE DATA HAVE A WEALTH OF OBSERVATIONS FROM HUBBLE, SPITZER, CHANDRA AND MANY OTHER TELESCOPES.

THE FORMER COULD POTENTIALLY BE EXPLAINED IF MANY OF THE DESCENDANTS OF UV-BRIGHT GALAXIES AT Z=4 HAVE TOO MUCH DUST BY Z=3 TO BE INCLUDED IN  LYMAN-BREAK SAMPLES. THE LATTER PROBLEM COULD BE RESOLVED IF THE FLUXES OF MANY FIR AND SUB-MM SELECTED GALAXIES ARE AFFECTED BY BLENDING.  THE PROJECT WILL EMPLOY STATE-OF-THE ART SEMI-ANALYTICAL MODELS FOR GALAXY EVOLUTION, BOTH FOR GUIDANCE IN DEVELOPING FLEXIBLE BAYESIAN PRIORS, AND FOR GUIDANCE ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS. AS PART OF THE WORK WE PLAN TO FURTHER TEST AND IMPROVE THE TREATMENT OF DUST IN THESE MODELS."""

THEY HAVE CHANGED MORPHOLOGICALLY, TRANSITIONING FROM DISK-DOMINATED GALAXIES TO BULGE-DOMINATED SYSTEMS.  THESE BULGE-DOMINATED PASSIVE GALAXIES HAVE DOUBLED IN STELLAR MASS SINCE Z#tilde#1, INDICATING THAT THEY PREVIOUSLY UNDERWENT PERIODS OF ACTIVE STAR FORMATION WHILE THE COSMIC STAR FORMATION RATE (SFR) DECREASED BY OVER AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OVER THIS SAME TIME PERIOD (E.G., MADAU AND DICKINSON 2014). WHAT PROCESS LED TO THE INCREASED SFR AT HIGH REDSHIFT AND WHAT CAUSED THE MORPHOLOGICAL  TRANSFORMATION? IT IS BELIEVED THAT GALAXY MERGERS AND INTERACTIONS COULD HAVE PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN THIS EVOLUTION. OBSERVATIONS OF THE GALAXY MERGER RATE HAVE SHOWN A SIMILAR DECREASE BETWEEN Z#tilde#1 AND TODAY (E.G., KARTALTEPE ET AL. 2007). THE MERGER OF TWO DISK-DOMINATED GALAXIES CAN LEAD TO THE FORMATION OF A BULGE-DOMINATED SYSTEM AND THE MERGER OF TWO GAS RICH GALAXIES CAN ENHANCE STAR FORMATION IN THOSE GALAXIES RELATIVE TO ISOLATED SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, THE PRECISE CONTRIBUTION THAT GALAXY MERGERS HAVE PLAYED IN THE OVERALL EVOLUTION OF THE COSMIC SFR IS STILL  AN OPEN QUESTION.  THE GALAXIES WITH THE HIGHEST STAR FORMATION RATES ARE BEST DETECTED IN THE FAR-INFRARED. THE HERSCHEL SPACE OBSERVATORY HAS DETECTED MANY SUCH OBJECTS OUT TO Z#tilde#4. THESE OBJECTS ARE KNOWN AS LUMINOUS AND ULTRALUMINOUS INFRARED GALAXIES (LIRGS AND ULIRGS) AND ARE DEFINED BY THEIR TOTAL INFRARED LUMINOSITY. THESE GALAXIES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE AT AN IMPORTANT TRANSITION STAGE BETWEEN  GAS-RICH SPIRAL GALAXIES AND MASSIVE ELLIPTICAL GALAXIES AND QUASARS (SANDERS ET AL. 1988). ALTHOUGH THEY ARE QUITE RARE IN THE LOCAL UNIVERSE, (U)LIRGS BECOME MUCH MORE COMMON AND START TO DOMINATE THE COSMIC STAR FORMATION RATE AT Z>0.7 (E.G., LE FLOC''H ET AL. 2005, MAGNELLI ET AL. 2013) AND LIKELY PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE AT THE PEAK OF GALAXY ASSEMBLY (Z#tilde#2). COLLECTIVELY, THESE OBJECTS CONTRIBUTE THE BULK OF THE STAR FORMATION RATE DENSITY AT THIS KEY EPOCH OF STAR FORMATION AND AGN ACTIVITY AND THEREFORE, UNDERSTANDING THE ORIGIN OF THESE EXTREME LUMINOSITIES IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIVE ROLE OF SEVERAL IMPORTANT PROCESSES IN GALAXY  EVOLUTION.  MORPHOLOGICAL STUDIES OF LOCAL (U)LIRGS HAVE SHOWN UNAMBIGUOUSLY THAT A GALAXY''S INFRARED LUMINOSITY IS CORRELATED WITH THE PRESENCE OF GALAXY MERGERS AND INTERACTIONS AS WELL AS WITH THE STAGE THAT THESE MERGERS ARE IN (E.G., VEILLEUX ET AL. 2002). HOWEVER, THE ROLE OF MERGERS AND INTERACTIONS AT HIGHER REDSHIFTS, WHERE THESE POPULATIONS DOMINATE, IS NOT YET WELL CONSTRAINED. WE WILL PUT STRONG CONSTRAINTS ON THIS ROLE AT HIGH REDSHIFT FOR THE FIRST TIME BY CONSTRUCTING AND ANALYZING A LARGE COMPREHENSIVE SAMPLE OF (U)LIRGS AT 0<Z<4 ACROSS SEVERAL OF THE MOST COMMONLY STUDIED DEEP FIELDS. WE WILL SELECT TARGETS FROM THE VARIOUS SURVEY FIELDS THAT OVERLAP WITH HST OPTICAL AND NIR IMAGES (FROM THE GOODS-HERSCHEL, CANDELS-HERSCHEL, PEP, AND HERMES PROGRAMS).

BY COMBINING THESE KEY DATA SETS, WE WILL  BE ABLE TO QUANTIFY THE ROLE OF GALAXY MERGERS AND INTERACTIONS TO THE COSMIC SFR AND AGN ACTIVITY.

TO OVERCOME THIS LIMITATION, WE WILL DEVELOP THE COMPOSITE SYNOPTIC MAPS, WHICH COMBINE TRADITIONAL SYNOPTIC CHARTS FOR WEAK-FIELD AREAS WITH THE FULL VECTOR MAPS FOR AREAS OF STRONG MAGNETIC FIELD. THE USE OF COMPOSITE SYNOPTIC MAPS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE MODELING OF GLOBAL MAGNETIC FIELDS. FINALLY, WE WILL CREATE THE SYNOPTIC CHARTS OF (THE RADIAL COMPONENT OF) THE CHROMOSPHERIC MAGNETIC FIELD. DUE TO THE PREVALENCE OF FORCE-FREE FIELD CONDITIONS, THE CHROMOSPHERIC FIELDS ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE MUCH BETTER BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR THE EXTRAPOLATION MODELS. ONE DIFFICULTY THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE CREATION OF THESE MAPS IS THE DIVERGENCE OF MAGNETIC FIELD WITH HEIGHT AT THE CHROMOSPHERIC LEVEL, WHICH INVALIDATES THE ASSUMPTION OF VERTICALITY OF MAGNETIC FIELD UNDER WHICH THE PHOTOSPHERIC SYNOPTIC CHARTS ARE CONSTRUCTED. TO OVERCOME THAT DIFFICULTY, WE WILL EMPLOY THE MEAN CORRECTION FUNCTION DERIVED FROM THE OBSERVATIONS (JIN ET AL. 2013). ALL CODES DEVELOPED FOR THE CREATION OF THESE NEW DATA PRODUCTS WILL BE MADE PUBLIC BY PROVIDING THEM TO CCMC AND SDO/HMI TEAM. ALL DATA PRODUCTS WILL BE PUT INTO A PUBLIC DOMAIN VIA SDAC AND NSO DIGITAL LIBRARY."

ONEHAG. 2011, A A, 528, A85 FIND THAT SOLAR TWINS IN M67 HAVE PHOTOSPHERIC SPECTRA THAT ARE VIRTUALLY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SUNS AT ECHELLE RESOLUTIONS. THEREFORE, K2 DATA WOULD ENABLE FOR THE FIRST TIME A HIGH PRECISION COMPARISON OF THE VARIABILITY CHARACTERISTICS OF SOLAR ANALOGS TO THAT OF THE SUN, WHICH IS CHARACTERIZED BY CYCLE RELATED VARIABILITY AT THE LEVEL OF ABOUT 0.1   1 MMAG  AND A SUPERIMPOSED ROTATIONAL MODULATION BY SPOTS WITH AMPLITUDES IN THE 1   3 MILLIMAG RANGE. OUR PRIMARY OBSERVATIONAL OBJECTIVE IN THIS PROPOSAL IS TO OBTAIN ESTIMATES OF ROTATION PERIODS OF SOLAR TYPE STARS IN M67 WITH PREVIOUS CA II ACTIVITY MEASUREMENTS FROM GIAMPAPA.  2006, APJ, 651, 444. THE RESULTS FROM THIS PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS FOR  1 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ACTIVITY AND ROTATION AT SOLAR AGE AND  2  THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM EVOLUTION IN SUN LIKE STARS.  THE SOLAR COUNTERPARTS IN M67 HAVE AN APPARENT BRIGHTNESS OF V   14.5. THEREFORE, THE BENCHMARK PRECISION OF 170 PPM FOR V 12 G2 V STARS IN ONE LONG CADENCE  LC  OBSERVATION CAN BE ATTAINED IN 5 HOURS OR THE EQUIVALENT OF 10 LC OBSERVATIONS. ALTERNATIVELY, A PRECISION OF 0.5 MMAG NEEDED TO RESOLVE ROTATIONAL MODULATION IN THE 0.1  0.2  RANGE COULD BE ACHIEVED IN ABOUT 0.6 HOURS OR TWO LC SEQUENCES. APPROXIMATELY 2.8 SOLAR LIKE ROTATION PERIODS   27D  COULD BE OBSERVED IN THE  75 DAY DURATION OF K2 FIELD 5 OBSERVATION. OUR APPROACH WILL BE TO ANALYZE SEQUENCES OF 2   10 LC OBSERVATIONS FOR ROTATION MEASURES AND SINGLE LC SEQUENCES FOR TRANSIENT ACTIVITY. THE K2 DATA WILL BE AUGMENTED BY A CONTEMPORANEOUS SURVEY OF THE PROGRAM TARGETS USING LOWELL OBSERVATORYS NEW 4.3 M DISCOVERY CHANNEL TELESCOPE  DCT.  WHILE THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE IS TO OBTAIN ROTATION MEASURES OF SOLAR COUNTERPARTS IN M67, K2 OBSERVATIONS OF M67 WILL YIELD ADDITIONAL PERSPECTIVES ON THE VARIABILITY OF ITS MANY SOLAR TYPE STARS AT PRECISIONS THAT ARE UNATTAINABLE FROM THE GROUND FOR THE M67 SOLAR ANALOGS  V  14.5. THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE OF  SUPERFLARING   NOTSU. 2013  MAEHARA 2012 IN SUN LIKE STARS AT SOLAR AGE  COULD BE INVESTIGATED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ADDITION TO OTHER FORMS OF TRANSIENT ACTIVITY, EACH OF WHICH COULD IMPACT THE CONDITIONS IN EXOPLANETARY SYSTEMS. IN SUMMARY OF ONE IMPORTANT APPLICATION, THE K2 DATA SET FOR M67 WOULD BE AN INDISPENSIBLE FIRST STEP TOWARDS THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE CONDITIONS OF THE HABITABLE ZONES IN SUN LIKE STARS AT SOLAR AGE. FINALLY, TRANSITS OF SUPER EARTHS AND LARGER EXOPLANETS COULD BE DETECTED. THESE GOALS ARE SCIENTIFICALLY AND TECHNICALLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE K2 MISSION WHILE SCIENTIFICALLY RELEVANT TO NASA PROGRAMS SUCH AS HABITABLE WORLDS AND LIVING WITH A STAR."

THE CATE EXPERIMENT WILL USE MORE THAN 60 IDENTICAL TELESCOPES EQUIPPED WITH DIGITAL CAMERAS LOCATED ACROSS THE CONTINENT FROM OREGON TO SOUTH CAROLINA TO IMAGE THE SOLAR CORONA AND THEN SPLICE THESE IMAGES TOGETHER TO MAKE A 90 MINUTE MOVIE DURING THE TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE OF 21 AUGUST 2017. THE GOALS FOR THE HIGHLY LEVERAGED CATE EXPERIMENT ARE DIVERSE AND RANGE FROM PROVIDING AN AUTHENTIC STEM RESEARCH EXPERIENCE FOR STUDENTS AND LIFELONG LEARNERS, TO MAKING STATE-OF-THE-ART SOLAR CORONAL OBSERVATIONS OF THE PLASMA DYNAMICS OF CORONAL POLAR PLUMES, TO INCREASING THE US SCIENTIFIC LITERACY. THE DATA COLLECTED FOR THE 2017 ECLIPSE WILL BE FREELY AVAILABLE TO THE SCIENTIFIC, EDUCATION AND AMATEUR ASTRONOMY COMMUNITIES.  MAKING THE OBSERVATIONS FROM THE MORE THAN 60 LOCATIONS ESSENTIAL TO THIS EXPERIMENT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION FROM CITIZEN SCIENTISTS. THE CATE PROJECT ALREADY HAS OVER 45 VOLUNTEERS, RANGING FROM HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND TEACHERS TO ADVANCED AMATEUR ASTRONOMERS TO PROFESSIONAL SOLAR PHYSICISTS. THE CATE PROJECT IS DEDICATED TO THE IDEA OF DONATING EACH SITE INSTRUMENT TO THE VOLUNTEER WHO COLLECTS DATA WITH IT, AND FOR THIS REASON NO PUBLIC FUNDING FOR THE CATE EQUIPMENT IS BEING REQUESTED. THE CATE PROJECT CURRENTLY HAS A COMMITMENT FROM DAYSTAR FILTERS LLC TO DONATE BETWEEN 60-100 TELESCOPES AND SOLAR FILTERS NEEDED FOR THE EXPERIMENT, AND CATE PROJECT MEMBERS ARE WORKING TO SECURE THE REST OF THE EQUIPMENT NEEDED FOR THE EXPERIMENT.  TRAINING A TEAM OF 60-100 CITIZEN SCIENTISTS TO TAKE RESEARCH QUALITY ECLIPSE OBSERVATIONS WILL INVOLVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFORT, AND TO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT WE SEEK FUNDS FROM THE HELIOPHYSICS NASA/SMD SCIENCE EDUCATION CAN. THIS TWO-YEAR PROPOSAL WILL TRAIN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TO TAKE ECLIPSE DATA, AND THEN THESE STUDENTS WILL TRAIN VOLUNTEERS FOR THE 2017 CITIZEN CATE EXPERIMENT.   THE CATE TEAM HAS SUCCEEDED WITH TRAINING ALREADY: A PROTOTYPE TELESCOPE SYSTEM WAS PURCHASED AND TESTED BY THE NSO, AND THEN USED BY CATE VOLUNTEER DR. FRED ISBERNER IN THE 20 MARCH 2015 TOTAL ECLIPSE IN THE FAROE ISLANDS. ISBERNER WAS TRAINED WITH THE TELESCOPE BY BOB BAER AT SIU CARBONDALE. ALTHOUGH ISBERNER HAD NO PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH DIGITAL IMAGING USING A TELESCOPE, HE WAS USING TEST SOFTWARE, TRAVELED HALF-WAY AROUND THE WORLD, AND EXPERIENCED MARGINAL WEATHER CONDITIONS, ISBERNER SUCCEEDED IN COLLECTING IMAGES OF THE CORONA DURING ECLIPSE. ISEBERNER''S SUCCESS IS A KEY RESULT THAT SHOWS EVEN INEXPERIENCED CITIZEN ASTRONOMERS CAN BE TRAINED TO COLLECT SCIENTIFIC TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE DATA.  WITH THIS PROPOSAL WE WILL DEVELOP A SET OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT EXPERTS SPREAD GEOGRAPHICALLY ACROSS THE PATH OF THE TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE. WE WILL PURCHASE PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENTS THAT WILL BE PERMANENTLY LOANED TO THE HOST UNIVERSITIES, AND WE WILL TRAIN STUDENTS AT EACH UNIVERSITY THROUGH SEMESTER EMPLOYMENT WITH A LOCAL UNIVERSITY MENTOR, AND DURING A SUMMER INTERNSHIP. THE STUDENTS WILL LEARN TO COMPARE ECLIPSE DATA TO THE SPACE-BASED CORONAL DATA COLLECTED BY SEVERAL NASA HELIOPHYSICS MISSIONS LIKE SOHO/LASCO C2 AND SDO/AIA. THE STUDENTS WILL ALSO BE TRAINED TO USE THE TELESCOPES FOR NIGHT OBSERVATIONS FOR CITIZEN SCIENCE OBSERVATIONS OF COMETS. WE WILL SEND THE STUDENTS AND THEIR MENTORS WITH TELESCOPES TO THE 9 MARCH 2016 TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE IN INDONESIA WHERE THEY WILL COLLECT ECLIPSE DATA, AND LIKE ISBERNER, THEY WILL BECOME EXPERTS FOR THE CATE EXPERIMENT. AFTER THEY RETURN, THESE STUDENT EXPERTS WILL HELP TO TRAIN CATE VOLUNTEERS ALONG THE ECLIPSE PATH. FINALLY, THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES WILL TAKE DATA DURING THE 2017 TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE."

HELICITY PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN A BROAD RANGE OF SOLAR PHENOMENA FROM THE DYNAMO TO FLARES AND CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS CMES. HELICITY-LOADED FIELDS ARE VERY PROBABLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOST GEO-EFFECTIVE SOLAR PHENOMENA SUCH AS CMES AND FLARES. EXCESS OF HELICITY IN CORONAL MAGNETIC STRUCTURES CAN LEAD TOTHEIR INSTABILITY AND ERUPTION. THE SIGNATURE OF HELICITY FLOW FROM THE SOLAR INTERIOR TO THE PHOTOSPHERE AND CHROMOSPHERE IS THEREFORE VITAL FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF HELICITY IN SOLAR FLARE-CME ACTIVITY. THE KINETIC HELICITY OF SUBSURFACE FLOWS CAN BE USED AS A PROXY OF MAGNETIC-CURRENT HELICITY IN THE SOLAR INTERIOR AND WILL BE CRUCIAL FOR STUDIES OF THE EVOLUTION OF ACTIVE REGIONS, THEIR FLARE ACTIVITY, AND THE PROPAGATION OF HELICITY. THE PROPOSED DATA PRODUCT WILL THUS PROVIDE A CRUCIAL LINK BETWEEN THE EVOLUTION OF MAGNETIC FIELDS BELOW THE SURFACE AND THAT OBSERVED IN THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE USING MAGNETOGRAMS. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THAT SUCH A DATA SET WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE COMMUNITY. METHODOLOGY,WE WILL PRODUCE THREE DATA PRODUCTS: THE KINETIC HELICITY,ITS VERTICAL CONTRIBUTION, AND THE NORMALIZED HELICITY GRADIENT VARIANCE NHGV PARAMETER THAT CAPTURES THE VARIATION OF KINETIC HELICITY WITH DEPTH AND TIME. THE INPUT MEASUREMENTS ARE THE DAILY SUBSURFACE FLOWS FROM THE SURFACE TO A DEPTH OF 16 MM DERIVED FROM SDO-HMI DOPPLERGRAMS USING THE DRMS RING-DIAGRAM PIPELINE. FROM THESE MEASUREMENTS, WE WILL CALCULATE THE PROPOSEDDATA PRODUCTS AS A FUNCTION OF DISK POSITION COVERING THE WHOLE SUN INCLUDING ACTIVE AS WELL AS QUIET REGIONS. THE SUBSURFACE HELICITY OF QUIET REGIONS PROVIDES A SOLAR BACKGROUND AND WILL BE USED TO CALIBRATE THE HELICITY OF ACTIVE REGIONS. THE CADENCE AND THE SPATIAL GRID OF THE FULL-DISK MAPS WILL BE GIVEN BY THOSE OF THE INPUT DATA. WE WILL REMOVE ANY SYSTEMATIC EFFECTS PRESENT IN THE SUBSURFACE FLOW MEASUREMENTS BEFORE CALIBRATING THE HELICITY DATA PRODUCTS. WE HAVE ALREADY TESTED OUR METHOD DERIVING THE HELICITY QUANTITIES FROM EXISTING SUBSURFACE FLOW DATA. WORK PLAN: WE WILL CREATE THE DATA PRODUCTS FROM EXISTING ARCHIVED SUBSURFACE FLOW DATA INCLUDING THEIR CALIBRATION AND DOCUMENTATION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO CREATE NEW DATA PRODUCTS AS SOON AS SUBSURFACE FLOW MEASUREMENTS BECOME AVAILABLE, WHICH OCCURS TYPICALLY WITHIN A FEW DAYS FROM SDO-HMI VIA JSOC, AND WILL ADD THEM TO THE DATA SET. IN THIS WAY, WE WILL CREATE A DATASET THAT CAN BE USED FOR STATISTICAL STUDIES WITH LARGE SAMPLES AS WELL AS FOR AN ANALYSIS OF ACTIVE REGIONS THAT ARE STILL PRESENT ON THE SUN. WE WILL MAKE THE DATA PRODUCTS FITS AND ASCII FILES AVAILABLE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN THROUGH WEBSITE ARCHIVESAND VIRTUAL OBSERVATORIES WITH THE HELP OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERS BASED AT NSO. RELEVANCE: MAKING THE SUBSURFACE HELICITY AVAILABLE AS A DATA RESOURCE TO THE HELIOPHYSICS COMMUNITY WILL GREATLY ENHANCE THE SCIENTIFIC RETURN FROM SDO-HMI AND WILL BE CRUCIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING MAGNETIC ACTIVITY FROM THE INTERIOR THROUGH THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE.

NON-GEOMETRIC TERRAIN HAZARDS ARE MISSION-ENDERS FOR AUTONOMOUS GROUND VEHICLES ON EARTH AND BEYOND. SPIRIT WAS MIRED IN SOFT SOIL ON MARS; LUNOKHOD BECAME STUCK IN REGOLITH ON THE MOON. AUTONOMOUS GROUND VEHICLES MUST DETECT AND REACT TO OFF-NOMINAL CONDITIONS TO LIMIT RISK AND MAXIMIZE PERFORMANCE. WHILE VISUAL AND ACTIVE OPTICAL SENSORS (E.G., STEREO CAMERAS AND LIDAR) EXCEL AT SENSING GEOMETRIC OBSTACLES, THEY FAIL TO DETECT HAZARDS LIKE WEAK OR SLIPPERY TERRAIN. RECENT RESEARCH INTO SENSING OF NONGEOMETRIC TERRAIN PROPERTIES TAKES A  DRIVE-BY-FEEL  APPROACH, WHERE TERRAIN PROPERTIES ARE MEASURED BY DRIVING OVER THE TERRAIN AND COMPARING OBSERVED MOTION TO ACTUATION EFFORT. THE MEASUREMENTS ARE CORRELATED WITH TERRAIN APPEARANCE TO PREDICT UPCOMING HAZARDS. WHILE EFFECTIVE AT SHORT RANGE, THIS APPROACH IS INDIRECT AND CANNOT MEASURE TERRAIN PROPERTIES WITHOUT WHEEL-TERRAIN CONTACT. WE PROPOSE A NOVEL, TWO-PRONGED APPROACH INCORPORATING LONG-RANGE SENSING AND RECEDING HORIZON CONTROL TO ENSURE SAFE OPERATION DURING AUTONOMOUS PLANETARY TRAVERSE. THE PROPOSED APPROACH INVESTIGATES AND DEVELOPS DETECTION OF NON-GEOMETRIC HAZARDS WITH MULTIPLE SENSING MODES TO ASCERTAIN TERRAIN PROPERTIES AT RANGE. SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING MAPS MULTI-MODE LONG-RANGE SENSOR DATA TO TERRAIN PROPERTIES MEASURED BY DIRECT-CONTACT INSTRUMENTS AND TO OBSERVED VEHICLE PERFORMANCE.

THE VISION OF RSSA IS TO ACCELERATE THE DISCOVERY OF PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN SAFETY THREATS IN REAL TIME AND ENABLE RAPID MITIGATION OF SAFETY RISKS THROUGH ANALYSIS OF MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF AVIATION DATA. OUR INNOVATION SUPPORTS THIS VISION BY DESIGNING A HYBRID ARCHITECTURE COMBINING TRADITIONAL DATABASE TECHNOLOGY AND REAL-TIME STREAMING ANALYTICS IN A BIG DATA ENVIRONMENT. THE INNOVATION INCLUDES THREE MAJOR COMPONENTS: A BATCH PROCESSING FRAMEWORK, TRADITIONAL DATABASES AND STREAMING ANALYTICS. IT ADDRESSES AT LEAST THREE MAJOR NEEDS WITHIN THE AVIATION SAFETY COMMUNITY. FIRST, THE INNOVATION SUPPORTS THE CREATION OF FUTURE DATA-DRIVEN SAFETY PROGNOSTIC DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS THAT MUST PULL DATA FROM HETEROGENEOUS DATA SOURCES AND SEAMLESSLY COMBINE THEM TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR NAS STAKEHOLDERS. SECOND, OUR INNOVATION OPENS UP THE POSSIBILITY TO PROVIDE REAL-TIME NAS PERFORMANCE ANALYTICS DESIRED BY KEY AVIATION STAKEHOLDERS. THIRD, OUR PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE PROVIDES A MECHANISM FOR SAFETY RISK ACCURACY EVALUATIONS. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS INNOVATION, WE HAVE THREE TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES AND RELATED WORK PLAN EFFORTS. THE FIRST OBJECTIVE IS THE DETERMINATION OF THE SYSTEM AND FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS. WE IDENTIFY THE SYSTEM AND FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS FROM AVIATION SAFETY STAKEHOLDERS FOR A SET OF USE CASES BY INVESTIGATING HOW THEY WOULD USE THE SYSTEM AND WHAT DATA PROCESSING FUNCTIONS THEY NEED TO SUPPORT THEIR DECISIONS. THE SECOND OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE A BIG DATA TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE.

OUR INNOVATION IS RESEARCHED THROUGH ACHIEVEMENT OF FIVE OBJECTIVES AND ASSOCIATED WORK EFFORTS. THE FIRST OBJECTIVE IS THE REFINEMENT OF USE CASES FOR THE BIG DATA APPLICATION. WE DRAW UPON OUR KNOWLEDGE GAINED IN PHASE I RESEARCH AND CONTINUED INTERACTIONS WITH AVIATION STAKEHOLDERS TO NARROW THE USE CASES TO SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS THAT ARE A CHALLENGE TO NASA AND THE BROADER AVIATION COMMUNITY RELATED TO RSSA, SMARTNAS, AND OTHER ATM RESEARCH EFFORTS. THE SECOND OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE A BIG DATA TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE AND PROCESSING CAPABILITIES FOR THE MORE SPECIFIC USE CASES DEVELOPED TO MEET OBJECTIVE 1. THE THIRD OBJECTIVE IS TO ACHIEVE A SUBCOMPONENT DEMONSTRATION FOR EACH REFINED USE CASE SO THAT WE CAN MEASURE THE BENEFIT OF USING THESE TECHNIQUES TO SOLVE ATM ANALYTICS CHALLENGES.

ANALYTICS TO MEET A VARIETY OF RESEARCH NEEDS. FINALLY, OUR FIFTH OBJECTIVE IS TO PURSUE COMMERCIALIZATION VIA OUTREACH TO GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS. MOST CURRENT AVIATION RESEARCH FOCUSES ON SMALLER DATASETS OR SPECIFIC DATA-TYPES. A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF DATA THUS SITS UN-ANALYZED AND POTENTIALLY HOLDS A RICH SET OF UNDISCOVERED TRENDS THAT MAY BE VALUABLE FOR AVIATION SAFETYASSURANCE AND NAS EFFICIENCY-ENHANCEMENT.

NASA\'S \'SIMILAR DAYS IN THE NATIONAL AIRSPACE SYSTEM (NAS)\' RESEARCH ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE, BUT, THE RESEARCH TOOLS PRODUCE NOT A SINGLE RECOMMENDED TMI CHOICE BUT AN ARRAY OF CHOICES, WITH THE FINAL DECISION AGAIN LEFT TO THE MANAGER\'S INTUITION. THE PROPOSED SBIR RESEARCH PROVIDES A CAPABILITY FOR DOWN-SELECTING TO THE MOST EFFECTIVE TMI CHOICE BY DEVELOPING A WHAT-IF ANALYSIS FUNCTIONALITY FOR EXPLORING MULTIPLE TMI OPTIONS BY REALISTICALLY SIMULATING NAS-WIDE OPERATIONS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF INDIVIDUAL TMI OPTIONS. THIS WHAT-IF ANALYSIS CAPABILITY ACHIEVES ACCURATE MODELING OF NAS TRAFFIC FLOWS UNDER UNCERTAINTY BY CREATIVELY INTEGRATING TWO INNOVATIONS. THE FIRST IS A TRAFFIC FLOW MODELING FRAMEWORK FOR ENABLING FAST AND ACCURATE SIMULATION OF INDIVIDUAL AIRCRAFT TRANSITS THROUGH THE NAS NETWORK. THIS TRAFFIC FLOW MODELING FRAMEWORK, WHICH WE CALL THE HYBRID TRAFFIC FLOW MODEL COMBINES DESIRABLE FEATURES OF TRAJECTORY-BASED MODELS WITH AGGREGATE TRAFFIC FLOW MODELS TO ALLOW FAST, NEAR REAL-TIME NAS PERFORMANCE EVALUATION UNDER MULTIPLE CANDIDATE TMI OPTIONS. EACH OPTION IS EVALUATED UNDER MULTIPLE SCENARIOS TO CAPTURE THE WHOLE RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES AS PER THE UNDERLYING REAL WORLD UNCERTAINTIES,. THE SECOND IS BAYESIAN NETWORKS FOR MODELING VARIATIONS CAUSED BY UNDERLYING NAS UNCERTAINTY FACTORS WITH EXPLICIT ENCODING OF HUMAN REASONING BEHIND MULTIPLE INFLUENCING DECISIONS (E.G., CENTER MIT RESTRICTION IMPOSITIONS, AIRLINE CANCELLATIONS), THIS ENABLES REALISTIC TRAFFIC DEMAND AND CAPACITY FORECASTING FOR FEEDING THE TRAFFIC FLOW MODEL-BASED TFM EVALUATIONS."

THE 8 HTT MIXER IS THE LOW VELOCITY REGION IMMEDIATELY UPSTREAM OF THE M5HIQ NOZZLE.  INSIDE THE FACILITY MIXER, DILUTION AIR AND HOT FLOW FROM THE FACILITY COMBUSTOR ARE MIXED TOGETHER TO FORM THE ENTRANCE FLOW TO THE M5HIQ NOZZLE.  FOR A NOMINAL MACH 5 TEST, THE MIXED FLOW TEMPERATURE IS APPROXIMATELY 2150 RANKINE.  THE FACILITY HAS CONDUCTED NUMEROUS TESTS AT THIS NOMINAL MACH 5 CONDITION AND IS CAPABLE OF DELIVERING STEADY OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS FOR PERIOD OF 100 SECONDS WITHOUT EXCEEDING HIGH TEMPERATURE INTERLOCKS INSTALLED AT KEY LOCATIONS ON THE MIXER LINER AND M5HIQ NOZZLE. FUTURE CUSTOMERS HAVE IDENTIFIED TEST REQUIREMENTS AT CONDITIONS SIMULATING FLIGHT AT MACH 5.5. THIS SIMULATION REQUIRES THAT BOTH THE MIXER LINER AND THE EXISTING MACH 5 NOZZLE BE OPERATED AT TEMPERATURES THAT EXCEED THE DESIGN VALUE.  IT IS KNOWN THAT EXCEEDING THE DESIGN TEMPERATURE IS ACCEPTABLE AS LONG AS THE RUN TIME IS SHORTENED SO THAT RED-LINE TEMPERATURE LIMITS ARE NOT VIOLATED DURING A TEST RUN.  HOWEVER, THE ALLOWABLE RUN DURATION IS NOT KNOWN.  THE ALLOWABLE RUN TIME DURATION AT TEMPERATURES EXCEEDING THE NOMINAL DESIGN VALUE MUST BE KNOWN SO THAT FUTURE FACILITY USERS CAN DETERMINE HOW MANY RUNS ARE REQUIRED FOR THEM TO COMPLETE THEIR REQUIRED TEST MATRIX.  2.0SCOPE&OBJECTIVE(S):2.1THE SCOPE OF THIS TASK ORDER IS TO CONDUCT AN ANALYTICAL STUDY TO DETERMINE THE ALLOWABLE RUN TIME (SECONDS) FOR THE MIXER AND THE M5HIQ NOZZLE AT STAGNATION TEMPERATURE LEVELS EXCEEDING THE NOMINAL DESIGN LEVEL AT NOZZLE INLET STAGNATION PRESSURE LEVELS PROVIDED AS GOVERNMENT FURNISHED INFORMATION (GFI) UNDER THIS TASK ORDER. 2.2 THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS TASK ORDER ARE TO:2.2.1ANALYTICALLY DETERMINE THE ALLOWABLE RUN TIME FOR THE EXISTING 8HTT MIXER AND M5HIQ NOZZLE AT TWO CONDITIONS EXCEEDING THE NOMINAL DESIGN TEMPERATURE LEVEL. 2.2.2IDENTIFY THE LIMITING FACTOR ON RUN TIME FOR EACH MACH CONDITION AND INVESTIGATE DESIGN MODIFICATIONS THAT WOULD EXTEND THE RUN TIME LIMITS.  3.0DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK/TASKS TO BE PERFORMED:  THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PERFORM THE FOLLOWING TASKS:   3.1MIXER LINER AND M5HIQ TRANSIENT THERMAL ANALYSIS:  (DELIVERABLE ITEM 4.3)3.1.1THE CONTRACTOR SHALL CONSTRUCT A SINGLE TRANSIENT THERMAL MODEL OF THE MIXER AND M5HIQ NOZZLE.  THE THERMAL MODEL SHALL BE CONSTRUCTED FROM MIXER LINER AND M5HIQ HARDWARE GEOMETRY AND MATERIAL INFORMATION FURNISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT (GFI 5.1).   3.1.2THE CONTRACTOR SHALL UTILIZE THE TRANSIENT THERMAL MODEL DEVELOPED IN SOW TASK 3.1.1 TO CONDUCT TRANSIENT THERMAL ANALYSES AT TWO DIFFERENT CONDITIONS SPECIFIED BY THE NASA TECH POC.  THE TWO DIFFERENT ANALYSIS CONDITIONS PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT (GFI 5.2) WILL CONSIST OF THE MIXER STAGNATION PRESSURE, THE MIXER STAGNATION TEMPERATURE, AND THE TOTAL FLOW RATE THROUGH THE MIXER AND M5HIQ NOZZLE.  THE CONDITIONS PROVIDED AS GFI 5.2 WILL BE REPRESENTATIVE OF FLIGHT SIMULATION AT MACH 5.3 AND MACH 5.5.  THE TRANSIENT THERMAL ANALYSIS SHALL BE UTILIZED BY THE CONTRACTOR TO PREDICT THE TIME REQUIRED FOR THE MIXER AND / OR M5HIQ NOZZLE TO EXCEED RED-LINE TEMPERATURE LIMITS AT THE TWO FLIGHT SIMULATION CONDITIONS.  3.1.3THE CONTRACTOR SHALL IDENTIFY THE AXIAL LOCATIONS IN THE MIXER / NOZZLE ASSEMBLY WHERE THE TEMPERATURE EXCEEDS MATERIAL LIMITS.

THE WORK WILL INVOLVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODEL POSTPROCESSORS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO UNDERSTAND THE DETAILED MECHANISMS THAT ARE AT WORK, AND THEIR COMPLEX INTERACTIONS.  THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS STUDY ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE RELEVANCE TO OTHER PLASMA SYSTEMS COUPLED VIA NEUTRAL-IONIZED INTERACTIONS THROUGHOUT THE HELIOSPHERE.  THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ADDRESSES THREE CRITICAL SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS:1)  WHAT ARE THE PHYSICAL MECHANISMS THAT GENERATE THE QUIET TIME LOW LATITUDE DYNAMO AND PRE?  2)  WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF LOWER AND MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE DISTURBANCES SUCH AS SUDDEN STRATOSPHERIC WARMING S ON THE IONOSPHERIC ELECTRODYNAMICS?   3)  WHAT ARE THE ION-NEUTRAL COUPLING PROCESSES THAT GENERATE DENSITY DEPLETIONS IN THE EQUATORIAL IONOSPHERE?THE RESEARCH WILL EMPLOY AN IMPROVED FIRST-PRINCIPLES NUMERICAL MODELING CAPABILITY OF THE IONOSPHERE-THERMOSPHERE SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED UNDER OTHER NASA FUNDING. THIS NEW MODEL HAS COUPLED THE SAM13 MODEL OF THE IONOSPHERE WITH THE TIMEGCM MODEL OF THE THERMOSPHERE.  NEW MODEL POSTPROCESSORS WILL BE DEVELOPED, AND USED TOGETHER WITH GROUND-BASED RADAR AND C/NOFS SATELLITE DATA TO UNCOVER THE DETAILED MECHANISMS DRIVING: (A) THE IONOSPHERIC DYNAMO AND PRE, (B) THE EFFECT OF SUDDEN STRATOSPHERIC WARMING S ON THE ION-NEUTRAL COUPLING AND RESULTING ELECTRODYNAMICS, AND (C) THE RECENTLY DISCOVERED THE EQUATORIAL DAWN DENSITY DEPLETIONS, THE DATA FROM THE C/NOFS SATELLITE, TOGETHER WITH GROUND-BASED RADARS WILL BE USED TO TEST AND VALIDATE THE FINDINGS FROM THE MODEL AND THE POSTPROCESSORS.  THE PROPOSED STUDY DIRECTLY ADDRESSES KEY ELEMENTS OF THE NASA LIVING WITH A STAR FOCUSED SCIENCE TOPIC PLASMA-NEUTRAL GAS COUPLING. SPECIFICALLY THE PROGRAM WILL INVESTIGATE THE PHYSICAL ISSUES OF PLASMA-NEUTRAL COUPLING IN THE IONOSPHERE AS WE SEEK TO RESOLVE STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE TRANSITION FROM A WEAKLY IONIZED PLASMA WITH THE LINKAGE OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD, AND OUR PHYSICAL UNDERSTANDING OF SUCH SYSTEMS IN THE HELIOSPHERE. THE AIMS OF THIS RESEARCH DIRECTLY ADDRESS NASA NEAR- AND LONG-TERM GOALS, AS OUTLINED IN THE 2009 LIVING WITH A STAR ANNOUNCEMENT (ROSES 2009), THE 2006 NASA STRATEGIC PLAN, AND THE HELIOPHYSICSDIVISION ROADMAP FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: 2005-2035.  THE PROPOSED WORK BRINGS TOGETHER EXPERTS ON THERMOSPHERE-IONOSPHERE COUPLING FROM THREE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS (ASTRA, NRL,AND UTD).  IT COMBINES MODELING AND DATA ANAL)''SIS, AND PROVIDES TRAINING FOR A NEW POSTDOC."

SSW EVENTS ARE CAUSED BY RAPID CHANGES IN THE MEAN STRATOSPHERIC ZONAL FLOW ACCOMPANIED BY AN ENHANCEMENT IN PLANETARY WAVE ACTIVITY, WHICH AS A RESULT CAN PRODUCE LARGE PERTURBATIONS IN THE ELECTRODYNAMICS AND ELECTRON DENSITY AT IONOSPHERIC HEIGHTS EVEN AT LOW-LATITUDES.  IT IS NOW RECOGNIZED THAT, FOR A BETTER SPECIFICATION OF THE IONOSPHERIC VARIABILITY, A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF SSW EVENTS AND THE COUPLING WITH THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE IS NEEDED. MUCH OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE IONOSPHERIC VARIABILITY DURING SSWS, HOWEVER, HAS COME FROM OBSERVATION MADE INDEPENDENTLY AND ONLY AT A FEW LOCATIONS. NEVERTHELESS, THESE OBSERVATIONS HAVE PROVIDED IMPORTANT BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE SSW EFFECTS IN THE IONOSPHERE. A BROADER, MORE GLOBAL, OBSERVATIONAL CAPABILITY AND MORE COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSES ARE REQUIRED TO UNAMBIGUOUSLY REVEAL THE GLOBAL RESPONSE OF THE IONOSPHERE TO SSW EVENTS. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ELUCIDATE THE GLOBAL IONOSPHERIC SIGNATURES ASSOCIATED WITH SSW EVENTS IN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE. TO REACH THIS GOAL, WE WILL ANSWER THE FOLLOWING SCIENCE QUESTIONS: A) WHAT IS THE TIME-DEPENDENT THREE-DIMENSIONAL (LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, ALTITUDE) RESPONSE OF THE IONOSPHERE TO SSW EVENTS AND HOW DOES THE IONOSPHERE EVOLVE THROUGH THE SSW RECOVERY PHASE? B) HOW DO THE EFFECTS OF SH SSW EVENTS ON THE EQUATORIAL AND LOW-LATITUDE IONOSPHERE COMPARE WITH THOSE DUE TO THE NH SSWS? C) WHAT IS THE GLOBAL STRUCTURE OF THE LUNAR SEMI-DIURNAL PERTURBATION IN THE IONOSPHERE AND TO WHAT EXTENT IS IT MODIFIED BY THE SSWS? TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS WE WILL USE FOUR-DIMENSIONAL (LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, HEIGHT AND TIME) IMAGES OF THE GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE IONOSPHERIC ELECTRON DENSITY. THESE IMAGES WILL BE OBTAINED USING A VARIETY OF DATA SOURCES AND THE IONOSPHERIC DATA ASSIMILATION FOUR-DIMENSIONAL (IDA4D) ALGORITHM. AN INVESTIGATION OF THE VARIABILITY IN THE ELECTRON DENSITY IMAGES AND UNDERLYING ELECTRODYNAMIC PROCESSES TAKING PLACE DURING THE MOST RECENT SSW EVENTS WILL BE AIDED BY UNIQUE OBSERVATIONS OF EQUATORIAL ELECTRIC FIELDS MADE BY THE ION VELOCITY METER (IVM) INSTRUMENT ONBOARD THE COMMUNICATION/NAVIGATION OUTAGE FORECASTING SYSTEM (C/NOFS) SATELLITE. THE RESULTS OF THE PROPOSED WORK WILL PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE, GLOBAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE IONOSPHERIC RESPONSE TO DIFFERENT TYPES AND MAGNITUDES OF SSW EVENTS. OUR ANALYSIS WILL PROVIDE THE TIME EVOLUTION OF THE IONOSPHERIC DISTURBANCES ASSOCIATED WITH SSW EVENTS.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT THESE RESULTS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO TEST AND VALIDATE NUMERICAL MODELING AND OTHER THEORETICAL EFFORTS PUT FORWARD BY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LWS FOCUS TEAM."

TO REACH THIS GOAL, WE WILL ANSWER THREE SCIENCE QUESTIONS 1. WHAT IS THE ENERGETIC AND CHEMICAL RESPONSE OF THE UPPER MESOSPHERE AND LOWER THERMOSPHERE TO WATER DEPOSITED IN THE LOWER THERMOSPHERE? 2. HOW DOES THE INJECTION OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER VAPOR CHANGE THE THERMODYNAMICS AND IMPACT THE PHYSICS OF PMC FORMATION? 3. HOW IS THE WATER VAPOR THAT GETS INJECTED INTO THE LOWER THERMOSPHERE, REDISTRIBUTED VERTICALLY TO THE PMC REGION NEAR 82 KM? TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS WE PROPOSE TO RELEASE A PLUME OF WATER VAPOR AT HIGH LATITUDES FROM A ROCKET PAYLOAD AND OBSERVE HOW THE ATMOSPHERE RESPONDS BOTH DURING AND AFTER THE RELEASE. WE WILL OBSERVE THE EVOLUTION OF THE PLUME OF WATER WITH LIDAR MEASUREMENTS FROM POKER FLAT RESEARCH RANGE PFRR. THE LIDAR IS CAPABLE OF TRACKING BOTH THE OPTICAL EMISSIONS FROM THE REGION AND MEASURING THE TEMPERATURE PROFILES. IN ADDITION, AN ADVANCED MESOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE MAPPER AMTM INSTRUMENT WILL BE DEPLOYED AT PFRR TO OBSERVE THE UPPER MESOSPHERE 87 KM BEFORE AND DURING THE WATER RELEASE TO PROVIDE QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION ON ANY DYNAMICS WAVE ACTIVITY AND CHANGES IN MESOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE. THE COMBINATION OF THE LIDAR AND MAPPING IMAGER THUS PROVIDES STRONG GROUND BASED DIAGNOSTICS FOR THE LAUNCH. THE LAUNCH WILL BE AT TWILIGHT SO THAT ANY FORMATION OF PMCS FROM THE PLUME WILL BE VISIBLE FROM THE GROUND. TRIMETHYL ALUMINUM TMA TRAILS WILL BE RELEASED IN ADDITION TO THE WATER FROM A SEPARATE PAYLOAD CANISTER. THE TMA IS CHEMILUMINESCENT AND CAN BE TRACKED OPTICALLY FROM THE GROUND WITH CAMERAS AND THE NAKED EYE. THE MOVEMENT OF THE TMA TRAILS WILL THUS PROVIDE A DIRECT INDICATION OF HOW THE WATER IS MOVING SINCE BOTH WILL BE TRANSPORTED BY THE BACKGROUND WINDS. THE TMA MEASUREMENTS WILL BE HELPFUL BOTH FOR REAL TIME WAATER CLOUD TRACKING AND FOR POST FLIGHT ANALYSIS. OUR GROUND BASED OBSERVATIONS WILL BE SUPPORTED BY OBSERVATIONS FROM THE NASA TIMED AND AIM MISSIONS AND MODELING RESULT FROM THE THERMOSPHERE IONOSPHERE MESOSPHERE ENERGETICS GENERAL CIRCULATION MODEL TIMEGCM. WE WILL INTERPRET THE OBSERVATIONS OF PMCS AND TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS FROM THE TIMED SATELLITE THAT ARE DRIVEN BY THE PLUME CHEMISTRY WITH OUR TIMEGCM MODEL. THE TIMEGCM WILL BE AUGMENTED TO INCLUDE ALL HEATING AND COOLING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE PLUME WATER VAPOR, ANY RESULTANT ICE FORMATION AS WELL AS VERTICAL TRANSPORT AND HEATING OF THE AMBIENT ATMOSPHERE BY THE ICE. MODEL RESULTS WILL BE COMPARED WITH OBSERVED PMC DATA FROM AIM AND CORRESPONDING TIMED SABER TEMPERATURES TO ELUCIDATE AND UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PMCS AND BULK THERMODYNAMICS.

THE APPROACH IS TO EXAMINE HOW FRESHWATER FLUXES CAN BE EXPRESSED AS A COMBINATION OF OCEAN VARIABLES BASED ON A MIXED-LAYER SALINITY BUDGET, COMPUTED WITHIN DYNAMICALLY-CONSISTENT, CONSTRAINED ESTIMATIONS OF THE OCEANIC STATE; AND TO USE THIS INFORMATION TO GUIDE THE INFERENCE OF FRESHWATER FLUX VALUES USING A PURE OBSERVATIONAL APPROACH.

THIS RISK IS GEOGRAPHICALLY VARIABLE, AS BOTH THE RATE OF SLR AND SOCIOECONOMIC EXPOSURE VARY WITH LOCATION.  BECAUSE REGIONAL SEA LEVEL IS A VALUABLE TOOL FOR UNDERSTANDING AND MONITORING CLIMATE, AND BECAUSE OF ITS ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS, MANY RECENT GOVERNMENT REPORTS HAVE UNDERSCORED THE NEED FOR A STANDARDIZED SET OF REGIONAL SEA LEVEL INDICATORS.

Of particular interest to the proposed research are polymers reinforced with carbon nanotubes and nanofibers. These nanocomposites have shown great potential as structural materials and adhesives under static loading conditions. However, knowing the quasi-static fracture and failure properties of aerospace materials is typically insufficient, as most materials become more brittle at high-strain rate and/or cryogenic temperatures. Additionally, aerospace structures often encounter dynamic transient loading events ranging from tool drop to space debris impact. The destructive capability of seemingly harmless foam traveling at high speeds and cold temperatures was demonstrated tragically in 2003 with the Columbia space shuttle. An understanding of the dynamic failure behavior of aerospace materials is therefore critical for structural safety. The proposed experimental methods can be utilized to accurately determine dynamic crack initiation toughness (Kcr), as well as dynamic fracture toughness as a function of crack growth parameters such as velocity and acceleration. The current setup is designed for testing relatively small samples (1##x1##), but the methodology can easily be scaled down to characterize even smaller specimens. Optically measured stress intensity factors for isotropic acrylic samples have been verified with a computational model. A linear relationship has also been found between pressure input and stress output from the device, allowing for dynamic material characterization over a broad range of strain rates. By altering the material of the pulse shaper and/or striker, an even wider array of strain rates has been attained. The final objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of this device for measuring fracture parameters of novel anisotropic materials, including orthotropic nanocomposites and adhesives employed in joining dissimilar materials. A gas-gun has been constructed that delivers a one-point impact to a relatively small sample in a controlled fashion. The gas gun launches a cylindrical striker into the long incident bar, sending a stress pulse along the incident bar and into the specimen. Ultra-high-speed digital photography of pre-notched acrylic samples tested on the apparatus show that fracture occurs over a few microseconds, whereas the sample##s motion is perceived in the millisecond time scale (due to inertial effects). Therefore, no additional supports are necessary to insure that crack initiation and propagation occur within the field-of-view of the camera. Using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method, images collected at #tilde#300,000 frames/sec are compared to those recorded in the undeformed state in order to map deformations in the region of interest. These displacement fields are used to extract fracture parameters, including fracture toughness, stress intensity factors, and crack velocity. Strain gages on the incident bar can then be used to independently verify optically measured stress intensity factors using finite element analysis. The device is designed to cost-effectively test the dynamic fracture properties of materials, both at crack initiation and during crack propagation. Test results will describe not only the initial toughness of the material, but also its ability to resist further crack growth once crack propagation has begun. The apparatus was created for the dynamic fracture testing of newly engineered materials which are expensive to produce in traditional specimen sizes. This methodology is also ideal for testing biomaterials such as bone and bone cement, which are difficult to procure in large sizes. This simple device is inexpensive to construct. By scaling down these methods, current camera technology will allow the future testing of significantly smaller samples, thereby decreasing development costs."

IN THE CASE OF EARTH, SEVERAL MULTICELLULAR GROUPS AROSE INDEPENDENTLY, BUT ONLY ANIMALS HAVE EVOLVED TISSUES THAT ALLOW ACTIVE, RAPID MOVEMENT AND FAST INTERCELLULAR COMMUNICATION. IN ORDER TO DISCERN HOW THESE FEATURES AROSE, WE MUST FIRST UNRAVEL THE EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE EARLIEST ANIMAL GROUPS AND IDENTIFY GENETIC MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING ADVANCED SYSTEMS SUCH AS NERVOUS AND MUSCULE TISSUE. A CANDIDATE GENE APPROACH HAS PROVIDED RESEARCHERS SOME INSIGHT AS TO IMPORTANT GENES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN INITIALLY IMPORTANT IN SHAPING NERVOUS AND MUSCULAR SYSTEMS, BUT OUR KNOWLEDGE IS LIMITED TO A FEW MODEL ANIMALS SPECIES. MOREOVER, RECENT STUDIES HAVE CHALLENGED THE LONG HELD VIEW THAT SPONGES, WHICH LACK NERVES AND MUSCLES, ARE THE BASAL-MOST ANIMAL GROUP. IN CONTRAST, PHYLOGENOMIC ANALYSES SUGGEST THAT CTENOPHORES, OR COMB JELLIES, MAY BE BASAL-MOST. THESE CONTRASTING HYPOTHESES HAVE RADICALLY DIFFERENT IMPLICATIONS FOR UNDERSTANDING WHICH ATTRIBUTES WERE PRESENT IN EARLY ANIMAL LINEAGES AND RAISE THE POSSIBILITY THAT NERVOUS SYSTEMS AND MUSCLES MAY HAVE INDEPENDENTLY EVOLVED TWICE IN METAZOANS. WITHIN  EXOBIOLOGY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,  NASA HAS TAKEN PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THE EVOLUTION OF ADVANCED LIFE. EXPLORING HOW MULTICELLULAR LIFE ON EARTH EVOLVED COMPLEX FEATURES SUCH AS NERVES AND MUSCLE WILL INFORM UNDERSTANDING OF CONDITIONS NEEDED FOR ADVANCED LIFE TO EVOLVE ELSEWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE. HEREIN WE FOCUS ON ANIMALS BECAUSE DUE TO THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEMS THEY POSSESS INTELLIGENCE AND DUE TO THEIR MUSCULAR SYSTEM THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACTIVELY CONTROL THEIR DISPERSAL. WE PROPOSE TO USE A GENOMIC APPROACH TO UNDERSTAND THE ORIGINS AND EARLY HISTORY OF ANIMALS. WE WILL FOCUS ON EXANT ANIMAL LINEAGES THAT BRANCHED OFF NEAR THE BASE OF THE ANIMAL TREE. THESE INCLUDE SPONGES, CNIDARIANS (ANEMONES AND JELLIES), CTENOPHORES (COMB JELLIES), AND PLACOZOANS (MICROSCOPIC, SPONGE-LIKE ANIMALS). MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE PROPOSE TO SEQUENCE AT LEAST 12 GENOMES AND 30 TRANSCRIPTOMES OF BASAL ANIMAL GROUPS. BY COLLECTING AND ANALYZING SUCH DATA FROM STRATEGICALLY CHOSEN TAXA, WE WILL ADDRESS THREE BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT EARLY ANIMAL LINEAGES: 1) WHAT ARE THE EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE MAJOR GROUPS? 2)HOW HAVE GENETIC MECHANISMS OF NERVOUS AND MUSCLE SYSTEMS EVOLVED? AND 3) DO THE THE BASAL ANIMAL LINEAGES HAVE UNIQUE GENE SYSTEMS UNKNOWN OR ABSENT IN BILATERIANS? TO THIS END, WE HAVE ASSEMBLED A COLLABORATIVE TEAM BETWEEN KEN HALANYCH S LAB, WHICH HAS LONG STANDING INTERESTS IN DEEP ANIMAL EVOLUTION, AND LEONID MOROZ S LAB, WHICH IS EXAMINING DIVERSITY AND FUNCTIONS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM ACROSS ANIMALS. BOTH LABS UTILIZE NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING APPROACHES AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP BIOINFORMATIC EXPERTISE.

PHASE I OF THIS PROPOSAL WILL STUDY APPROACHES FOR SAW SENSOR EMBODIMENTS THAT CAN BE EMBEDDED IN COMPOSITES (ANTENNA DESIGN FOR EMBEDDING OR ON THE SURFACE OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS) AND THE USE OF CLUSTERED SENSORS FOR ENHANCED REDUNDANCY, ACCURACY, AND RANGE. THE TARGET SENSOR MEASURANDS WILL BE TEMPERATURE, RANGE DATA, AND GAS DETECTION. PHASE I WILL STUDY TRADEOFFS IN CENTER FREQUENCY, BANDWIDTH, DEVICE EMBODIMENTS, AND TRANSCEIVER APPROACHES FOR LAUNCH, SPACE VEHICLE AND EXPLORATION. THE PHASE I STUDY AND PROTOTYPING WILL ENHANCE THE CURRENT UCF SAW SENSOR TRANSCEIVER CAPABILITIES BY MAKING AN ADVANCED TRANSCEIVER THAT WILL BE LESS THAN 1 KG IN WEIGHT, BE LESS THAN .05 M3 IN VOLUME, AND USE LESS THAN 5 W OF POWER. STUDIES AND EXPERIMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED TO ACHIEVE SINGLE ACQUISITION TIMES OF APPROXIMATELY 1 MS, OR LESS, AND MULTIPLE COHERENT INTERROGATION INTEGRATIONS AT A RATE OF 10 MS, OR LESS, FOR ENHANCED SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT RANGES OF 50-100 FEET WILL BE DEMONSTRATED AND MULTIPLE COHERENT INTEGRATIONS WILL BE STUDIED FOR DESIRED RANGES OF 0.5 TO 1 KM.

Though this concept has broad scientific application, it unequivocally supports the GEO-CAPE trace gas and aerosol measurements. GEO-TASO has three goals: advance the TRL of an optimally compact GEO-CAPE prototype spectrometer, provide a re-usable tool for addressing GEO-CAPE sensor trades, and test sensor-retrieval system performance over a range of spectral and spatial sampling scales using real scene data. Laboratory and airborne sensor data coupled with retrieval algorithm developments enable this IIP to determine the optimal spectral and spatial sampling and resolution values to meet the GEO-CAPE measurement objectives. This activity saves critical mission dollars through reduction of the mission formulation time; it reduces mission risk by closing the loop between the Science Traceability Matrix (STM) measurement objectives, sensor requirements, performance, and retrievals by providing relevant data for crucial trades. The compact spectrometer form being proposed offers a 3 times volume reduction compared to other design forms. This savings is critical for a geostationary mission. This IIP offers tangible cost savings across the GEO-CAPE mission life from formulation to flight by assisting in mission definition and advancing hardware to a flight ready TRL. This 3 year effort includes mission and system requirements definition, sensor assembly integration and performance testing, environmental testing, and two NASA DC-8 campaigns. Calibrated laboratory and flight data will be used in state of the art trace gas retrievals to assess the coupled sensor and algorithms ability to achieve the GEO-CAPE measurement objectives.

ACHIEVING A SHORT REVISIT TIME, HIGH SPATIAL AND SPECTRAL RESOLUTION AND HIGH SIGNAL-TO-NOISE-RATIO (SNR) USING CONVENTIONAL TECHNOLOGIES CAN REQUIRE RISKY, COMPLEX, ND LARGE PAYLOADS. HE OBJECTIVE OF THIS IIP IS TO ADVANCE THE TECHNOLOGICAL READINESS LEVEL (TRL) OF THE MULTI-SLIT OFFNER SPECTROMETER TECHNOLOGY. THIS TECHNOLOGY, EMPLOYED IN A GEOSTATIONARY REMOTE SENSING PAYLOAD, CAN ACCOMPLISH THE OCEAN COLOR MISSION WITH A SMALL PACKAGE, FAST REVISIT TIME, AND HIGH SNR BY PRODUCING HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGES AT MULTIPLE POSITIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY. DURING THIS THREE-YEAR IIP, WE PROPOSE TO BUILD A PROTOTYPE MULTI-SLIT OFFNER SPECTROMETER THAT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE GEO-CAPE EVENT IMAGER MISSION (A TIER II EARTH SCIENCE DECADAL SURVEY MISSION). WE WILL RAISE THE TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVEL (TRL) FROM TRL 3 TO TRL 6 BY SUBJECTING IT TO LAUNCH VIBRATION LEVELS, AND CHARACTERIZING ITS PERFORMANCE IN AN OPERATIONAL THERMAL VACUUM ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, WE WILL PERFORM SEVERAL STUDIES, WHICH DEMONSTRATE THE MULTI-SLIT OFFNER SPECTROMETER CAPABILITY TO PRODUCE COASTAL PRODUCTS REQUIRED FOR GEO-CAPE. THE BENEFITS OF A MULTI-SLIT OFFNER SPECTROMETER ARE CLEAR. IT CAN PRODUCE HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGERY FROM BOTH US COASTS AT A SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF 375 M IN LESS THAN 54 MINUTES, WHILE MAINTAINING A 1000:1 SNR IN A PAYLOAD OF ONLY 147 KG (33 CM APERTURE). IN CONTRAST, A CONVENTIONAL SPECTROMETER REQUIRES A PAYLOAD OF 550 KG (72 CM APERTURE). THE SMALLER PAYLOAD REDUCES BOTH RISK AND COST FOR THE MISSION."

WHILE LIDAR IS AN IDEAL INSTRUMENT TO MAKE RANGE RESOLVED AEROSOL SCATTERING MEASUREMENTS, SIMPLE SINGLE CHANNEL BACKSCATTER LIDARS (E.G. CALIPSO) CANNOT DIRECTLY PROVIDE THE DESIRED CALIBRATED AEROSOL SCATTERING PROFILES BECAUSE THE BACKSCATTER SIGNAL DEPENDS ON BACKSCATTER CROSS SECTION FROM EACH RANGE AND THE OPTICAL DEPTH TO THE SCATTERING VOLUME. FORTUNATELY, MOLECULAR BACKSCATTER IS DOPPLER BROADENED, WHILE AEROSOL BACKSCATTER REMAINS NARROW. THE HIGH SPECTRAL RESOLUTION LIDAR (HSRL) TECHNIQUE SPECTRALLY SEPARATES MOLECULES AND AEROSOLS LIDAR RETURNS. WITH KNOWN AIR DENSITY, HSRL SEPARATELY MEASURES EXTINCTION AND SCATTERING AT EVERY RANGE.

OPERATION OF SUAS MAY BE HIGHLY AUTOMATED, BUT HUMAN OVERSIGHT IS STILL REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A LAST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST FAILURES, ESPECIALLY THOSE DUE TO ERRORS IN THE GUIDANCE, NAVIGATION AND CONTROL (GNC) SYSTEM. OVERSIGHT OF THE SYSTEMS IS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THE VERIFICATION, VALIDATION, AND CERTIFICATION (V&V/C) ACTIVITIES REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE A HIGH SOFTWARE DESIGN ASSURANCE LEVEL (DAL) TYPICALLY HAVE NOT BEEN CONDUCTED FOR THESE SYSTEMS. IN SOME CASES THIS IS BECAUSE THE GNC SYSTEMS CONTAIN ELEMENTS SUCH AS ADAPTIVE AND LEARNING CAPABILITIES THAT MAKE V&V/C WITH EXISTING METHODS DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE, WHILE IN OTHER CASES THE ISSUE IS PRIMARILY COST, WHICH CAN BE PROHIBITIVE ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL, LOW-COST SYSTEMS. BARRON ASSOCIATES PROPOSES DEVELOPMENT OF AUTOMATED MONITORING CAPABILITIES THAT CAN ASSUME THE LOW-LEVEL MONITORING RESPONSIBILITIES CURRENTLY ALLOCATED TO HUMANS, ENABLING SAFE UAS OPERATIONS WITH REDUCED HUMAN OVERSIGHT.

HEAT WAVES HAVE BEEN INCREASING GLOBALLY IN THE PAST 5-10 YEARS AND ARE PROJECTED TO CONTINUE INCREASING THROUGHOUT THE 21ST CENTURY. THE VULNERABILITY OF A CITY''S POPULATION TO HEAT WAVES REFLECTS EXPOSURE TO EXTREME HEAT EVENTS, SENSITIVITY OF THE POPULATION TO IMPACTS, SUCH AS ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS, AND ADAPTIVE CAPACITY TO PREPARE FOR AND RESPOND TO HEAT WAVES. VULNERABILITY CAN BE ASSESSED AT THE CITY LEVEL AND ALSO COMPARATIVELY AMONG DIFFERENT PARTS OF A CITY. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME SUB-POPULATIONS ARE LESS RESILIENT TO HEAT WAVES THAN OTHERS, SUCH AS THE ELDERLY, THE VERY YOUNG AND THE ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED. IN ADDITION, VULNERABILITY TO HEAT WAVES IS EXACERBATED BY THE NON-CLIMATE STRESSOR OF URBAN HEAT ISLANDS (UHIS). AS NOTED AT THE NCA INDICATORS WORKSHOPS, SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS ARE ESPECIALLY AT RISK TO THE IMPACTS OF HEAT WAVES, DUE TO INCREASING ENERGY COSTS, AIR POLLUTION, AND HEAT-RELATED ILLNESS AND MORTALITY. THE PROJECT TEAM WILL ENGAGE URBAN STAKEHOLDERS IN A PROCESS TO DEVELOP A SET OF VULNERABILITY INDICATORS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON HEAT WAVES IN URBAN AREAS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSED WORK IS TO ELUCIDATE FOR URBAN GOVERNMENTS THE DEGREE TO WHICH HEAT WAVES ARE CHANGING, THE REAL-LIFE IMPACTS OF HEAT WAVES ON URBAN POPULATIONS, AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ADAPTATION ACTIONS TO REDUCE URBAN TEMPERATURES. THE PROPOSED APPROACH INTEGRATES PHYSICAL, ECOLOGICAL, AND SOCIOECONOMIC INFORMATION INTO A SET OF FIVE RELATED INDICATORS THAT ADDRESS VULNERABILITY. BASED ON STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT IN A 1ST PILOT CITY, THE INDICATOR METHODOLOGY WILL BE FINALIZED AND THEN IMPLEMENTED FOR THE 1ST PILOT CITY AND A 2ND PILOT CITY AS A TEST OF SCALE-UP. THE PROJECT TEAM WILL UTILIZE THE FOLLOWING DATASETS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE HEAT WAVE INDICATORS: *LAND SURFACE TEMPERATURE FROM AQUA/MODIS, *LAND COVER FROM TERRA AND AQUA/MODIS, TO DELINEATE URBAN AREAS,*NDVI FROM AQUA/MODIS, TO ASSESS GREENNESS AS A COOLING MECHANISM, *SOCIOECONOMIC DATASETS FROM NASA SEDAC, SUCH AS U.S. CENSUS GRIDS, TO IDENTIFY DISADVANTAGED/VULNERABLE GROUPS,*NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE (NWS) HEAT ADVISORIES/WARNINGS, TO HELP DEFINE CITY CONTEXT-SPECIFIC HEAT WAVES,*U.S. EPA''S UHI COMMUNITY ACTIONS DATABASE, TO IDENTIFY AND TEST ADAPTATION PROGRAMS TO BOOST RESILIENCE, AND *URBAN OZONE LEVELS FROM U.S. EPA''S AIR QUALITY SYSTEM. THE PROPOSED SET OF 5 INDICATORS INCLUDES: EXPOSURE INDICATORS: *URBAN HEAT WAVE INDICATOR: HEAT INDEX DEGREE DAYS IN A SINGLE SUMMER FOR \HEAT WAVES\"" DEFINED BY NWS HEAT ADVISORIES AND WATCHES/WARNINGS *URBAN HEAT ISLAND INDICATOR: DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AVERAGE URBAN AND RURAL LSTS DURING HEAT WAVES *AIR QUALITY INDICATOR: DAILY 8-HR MAXIMUM METROPOLITAN O3 VALUES DURING HEAT WAVES SENSITIVITY INDICATOR: *URBAN SOCIOECONOMIC AND HOTSPOT INDICATOR: CLASSIFICATION OF SENSITIVITY OF CENSUS BLOCK GROUPS BASED ON SOCIOECONOMIC CENSUS AND URBAN GREENNESS DATA ADAPTIVE CAPACITY INDICATOR: *URBAN ADAPTATION EFFECTIVENESS INDICATOR: MEASURED REDUCTIONS IN LST OR INCREASES IN NDVI IN NEIGHBORHOODS RELATED TO UHI REDUCTION MEASURES THE SCALE FOR EACH INDICATOR WILL BE CATEGORIES OF EQUAL INTERVALS, WHICH WILL REFLECT BOTH ABSOLUTE VALUES AND TRENDS WITH REFERENCE TO A BASELINE PERIOD.

THE LACK OF INSIGHT INTO CHROMOSPHERIC ENERGETICS IS IN PART BECAUSE IT IS A HIGHLY DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPLEX REGION WITH VARIOUS PHYSICAL PROCESSES PLAYING AN IMPORTANT ROLE: RADIATIVE TRANSFER, SCATTERING, TIME DEPENDENT PARTIAL IONIZATION EFFECTS, ION-NEUTRAL INTERACTION EFFECTS (INIE), SUCH AS AMBIPOLAR DIFFUSION AND THE HALL TERM, AND THERMAL CONDUCTION ALONG THE MAGNETIC FIELD, WHICH IS IMPORTANT IN THE UPPER CHROMOSPHERE, TRANSITION REGION (TR), AND CORONA.

THE TWO MECHANISMS ARE IMPACT EROSION, WHEN GASES ARE LOST AS A RESULT OF LARGE BODY IMPACTS, AND HYDRODYNAMIC ESCAPE, WHEN ATMOSPHERES EXPAND AND ESCAPE BECAUSE OF HEATING BY STELLAR IRRADIATION.

Recent studies suggest that even small changes in stratospheric humidity may have climate impacts that are significant compared to those of decadal increases in greenhouse gases. Future changes in stratospheric humidity and ozone concentration in response to changing climate are significant climate feedbacks. While the tropospheric water vapor climate feedback is well represented in global models, predictions of future changes in stratospheric humidity are highly uncertain because of gaps in our understanding of physical processes occurring in the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL, -13-18 Ian), the region of the atmosphere that controls the composition of the stratosphere. Uncertainties in the TTL chemical composition also limit our ability to predict future changes in atmospheric ozone. We propose a series of measurement campaigns using the long-range NASA Global Hawk (GH) unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to directly address these problems. A number of TTL processes affect stratospheric humidity and ozone: deep convective transport of water vapor and other chemical constituents into the TTL; the formation of ubiquitous thin cirrus in the TTL (which themselves have a large effect on the radiation budget and climate); limitation of stratospheric humidity by sedimenting ice crystals in TTL thin cirrus; slow vertical transport through the TTL; the effects of tropical atmospheric waves on TTL thermal structure, dehydration, and transport; and the chemistry of short-lived trace gases. Observations of TTL composition are sparse compared to those in other climatical1y important regions, partly because the high TIL altitude limits aircraft sampling. Further the utility of satellite measurements of TTL composition is reduced by the characteristically strong vertical gradients in the TTL. As a result, TTL processes are not well represented in global models. This investigation will provide data needed to address these shortcomings: high spatial resolution (only obtainable by aircraft) measurements over large geographical regions (requiring the GH range) and over multiple seasons. The proposed investigation fills several significant gaps in atmospheric science identified in the NASA Decadal Survey involving climate change, stratospheric ozone, and stratosphere-troposphere exchange. Science questions that will be addressed include the following: 1. What processes control the tropical tropopause temperature and the humidity of air entering the stratosphere (including their seasonal cycles)? 2. What are the dominant pathways for vertical transport from convective detrainment altitudes in the TTL up to the tropical tropopause in different seasons? 3. What are the formation processes, microphysical properties and climate impact of TTL cirrus, and how do these clouds regulate the humidity of air entering the stratosphere? 4. What are the chemical and transport processes that drive the budgets of precursors of ozone-destroying substances such as short-lived halogen compounds? 5. How will TTL cirrus, stratospheric humidity, and stratospheric ozone respond to a changing climate, and what are the resulting feedback effects?"

HOWEVER, EVEN AFTER DECADES OF SPACEFLIGHT MISSIONS, WE DO NOT KNOW IF MEDICATIONS ACT THE SAME IN THE SPACEFLIGHT ENVIRONMENT AS THEY DO ON EARTH.

THE POTENTIAL FOR THERAPEUTICALLY RELEVANT ALTERATION IN EITHER PHARMACOKINETICS (HOW THE BODY HANDLES ADMINISTERED MEDICATIONS) OR PHARMACODYNAMICS (HOW ADMINISTERED MEDICATIONS ACT UPON THE BODY) HAS LONG BEEN A CONCERN. THIS OBSERVATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDY IS A PROACTIVE STEP TOWARD ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE VIA REGULAR DIRECT QUESTIONING OF CREWMEMBER VOLUNTEERS, A MODEL THAT THE JSC NUTRITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY DISCIPLINE HAS PROVEN TO BE BOTH FEASIBLE AND USEFUL. A TABLET- OR HANDHELD DEVICE-BASED QUESTIONNAIRE WILL BE USED TO PERMIT FAST AND EFFICIENT COLLECTION OF DATA REGARDING CREWMEMBERS  MEDICATION USE ON A NEAR REAL-TIME BASIS, ELIMINATING THE CURRENT PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH RECALL OVER PERIODS OF WEEKS. SPECIFIC QUESTIONS REGARDING MEDICATION USE (SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THE QUESTIONS THAT PHYSICIANS ASK REGARDING PATIENT HEALTH) WILL BE ASKED OF EACH PARTICIPATING CREWMEMBER. THE DATA COLLECTION PROCESS WILL BE STREAMLINED BY USING A FLEXIBLY PROGRAMMED COMPUTERIZED SURVEY APPLICATION THAT LEVERAGES THE LIMITED MEDICATION CHOICES ABOARD, THE DOSES AVAILABLE, TYPICAL DOSING FREQUENCY, AND SIDE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH MEDICATION TO PROVIDE AN INDIVIDUALIZED SHORT QUESTIONNAIRE FOR EACH MEDICATION USE BY THE CREWMEMBER. CODED (DE-IDENTIFIED) DATA WILL BE DELIVERED WEEKLY TO A SECURE SERVER ON THE GROUND FOR ANALYSIS BY STUDY INVESTIGATORS. POST-FLIGHT (AFTER RE-ADAPTATION TO EARTH S GRAVITY), EACH PARTICIPATING CREWMEMBER WILL REPEAT RECORDING THEIR MEDICATION USAGE, SO THAT THEIR GROUND MEDICATION USAGE FREQUENCIES, DOSES, AND PERCEPTIONS MAY BE COMPARED TO THOSE RECORDED DURING FLIGHT."

THE ADVANCED AIR TRANSPORT TECHNOLOGY (AATT) PROJECT AND THE PRECEDING SUBSONIC FIXED WING (SFW) PROJECT HAVE IDENTIFIED METRICS AND GOALS FOR THE REDUCTION OF ENERGY COSTS, ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION, AND NOISE POLLUTION FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS (N+2 AND N+3) OF COMMERCIAL AIR VEHICLES. WHILE THE N+2 AND N+3 CONCEPT VEHICLES ARE EXPECTED TO OPERATE IN DIFFERENT ENVELOPES COMPARED TO TODAY S AIR VEHICLES, FUTURE VEHICLES EMPLOYING N+2 AND N+3 TECHNOLOGIES WILL STILL BE EXPECTED TO BE CERTIFIED FOR AND TO FLY THROUGH DANGEROUS ICING CONDITIONS. TO MITIGATE AIRFRAME ICE ACCRETION DANGERS ON AIRCRAFT EMPLOYING N+2 AND N+3 TECHNOLOGIES, DEVELOPING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ICING PHYSICS AND CONVECTIVE HEAT TRANSFER RELATED TO THE INITIAL ICE ROUGHNESS FORMED IN ICING CONDITIONS EXPECTED FOR N+2 AND N+3 BASED AIRCRAFT IS CRUCIAL. THE INITIAL ICE ROUGHNESS FORMED ON THE AIRFOIL SURFACE IS CRITICAL TO THE ACCRETION PROCESS BECAUSE IT INCREASES SKIN FRICTION DRAG, INCREASES DROPLET AND LIQUID WATER COLLECTION EFFICIENCY, AND DRAMATICALLY INCREASES THE CONVECTIVE HEAT TRANSFER RATES. RECENT ICE SHAPE LASER SCANNING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ICING RESEARCH TUNNEL (IRT) AT NASA GLENN RESEARCH CENTER HAVE ENABLED TRANSFORMATIVE INSIGHTS INTO THE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL EVOLUTION OF ROUGHNESS ON SYMMETRIC AIRFOILS IN LOW SPEED CONDITIONS. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL INCLUDE 1) CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF THE AIRFOIL ROUGHNESS EVALUATION SYSTEM (ARES) SOFTWARE FOR LASER SCAN POINT CLOUDS MEASURED ON SWEPT SURFACES OF VARYING CROSS SECTIONAL AREA, 2) ANALYSIS OF ICE ROUGHNESS ACCRETED ON LAMINAR FLOW WINGS AND BLENDED BODY SHAPES REPRESENTATIVE OF N+2 AND N +3 GEOMETRIES USING THE APPROACH OF MCCLAIN AND KREEGER (2013), AND 3) CHARACTERIZATION OF CONVECTION ON SURFACES USING REALISTIC UNWRAPPED ROUGHNESS AND MODEL ROUGHNESS IN A FLAT PLATE SUBSONIC WIND TUNNEL EMPLOYING THIN-FILM HEATERS AND INFRARED SURFACE TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS IN STEADY STATE CONDITIONS. PHASE I EFFORTS WILL FOCUS ON CHARACTERIZING ROUGHNESS EVOLUTION AND ENHANCED CONVECTION ON LAMINAR-FLOW AIRFOILS.

THE PROPOSED COLLABORATIVE ACTIVITIES WILL 1) ILLUMINATE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL ROUGHNESS EVOLUTION FOR N+2 AND N+3 GEOMETRIES AND FLIGHT ENVELOPES, 2) VERIFY PROPER ROUGHNESS SCALING APPROACHES FOR N+2 AND N+3 GEOMETRIES AND FLIGHT ENVELOPES, 3) REVEAL CONVECTIVE ENHANCEMENT CAUSED BY THE ROUGHNESS ON N+2 AND N+3 BASED GEOMETRIES, AND 4) VALIDATE CONVECTION MODELING APPROACHES BASED ON THE DISCRETE-ELEMENT ROUGHNESS APPROACH. THE ROUGHNESS CHARACTERIZATION EFFORTS ARE EXPECTED TO INCLUDE COLLABORATIVE WORK PERFORMED IN THE IRT.

THESE MEASUREMENTS CONSIST OF O3 AND H2O MEASUREMENTS FROM LAUDER, NEW ZEALAND; CLO MEASUREMENTS FROM MAUNA KEA, HAWAII; O3 AND H2O MEASUREMENTS FROM MAUNA LOA, HAWAII; CLO MEASUREMENTS FROM SCOTT BASE, ANTARCTICA; AND H2O MEASUREMENTS FROM TABLE MOUNTAIN, CALIFORNIA. THESE PROGRAMS ARE BEING COMBINED IN ORDER TO BEST PROVIDE LONG-TERM CONTINUITY AND SUPPORT OF THE INSTRUMENTS AND MEASUREMENTS. ALL THREE OF THESE SPECIES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE CLIMATE SYSTEM. OZONE MEASUREMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL TO MONITOR THE BEGINNING OF ITS RECOVERY, AND CLO MEASUREMENTS ARE NEEDED TO INTERPRET THIS PROCESS. WATER VAPOR IS THE RESERVOIR OF ODD HYDROGEN IN THE MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE, AND IS THEREFORE ALSO IMPORTANT TO OZONE CHEMISTRY. IT HAS ALSO BEEN SUGGESTED THAT VARIATIONS IN STRATOSPHERIC H2O HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON DECADAL-SCALE GLOBAL SURFACE CLIMATE CHANGE. THE MOST IMPORTANT GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO MAINTAIN STABLE MEASUREMENTS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE ACCURATE DETECTION OF LONG-TERM CHANGE. IN ORDER TO ENSURE CONTINUED STABLE OPERATION INSTRUMENTS NEED TO BE UPDATED SO THAT THEY CAN BE MAINTAINED WITH CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY. THE H2O INSTRUMENTS HAVE UNDERGONE SIGNIFICANT UPDATES, ESPECIALLY OVER THE LAST #tilde#4 YEARS, AND WE HAVE SHOWN THAT, AT MAUNA LOA AND TABLE MOUNTAIN, IT IS POSSIBLE WITH THESE NEW INSTRUMENTS TO EXTEND THE ALTITUDE RANGE OVER WHICH STABLE MEASUREMENTS CAN BE MADE TO 26-80KM (FROM THE ORIGINAL 40-80KM). BETWEEN 2010 AND 2011 OBSERVATIONS AT TABLE MOUNTAIN SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN H2O AT 26KM, CONSISTENT WITH SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS. THE NEW H2O INSTRUMENTS SHOULD, OVER THE PERIOD OF THIS PROPOSAL, REQUIRE MINIMAL ATTENTION. THE O3 AND CLO INSTRUMENTS PRESENTLY REMAIN ESSENTIALLY AS-BUILT BY MILLITECH #tilde#20 YEARS AGO, AND SEVERAL COMPONENTS NEED TO BE REPLACED. A NEW CLO RECEIVER HAS BEEN DESIGNED, COMPLETED, AND RECENTLY DEPLOYED ON THE CLO INSTRUMENT AT MAUNA KEA. A SECOND SUCH RECEIVER IS BEING BUILT AS PART OF A NEW, NRL FUNDED, CLO INSTRUMENT. THIS RECEIVER WILL BE COUPLED TO A REDESIGNED BACK END, AND THIS NEW INSTRUMENT WILL BE DEPLOYED AT MAUNA KEA ALONGSIDE THE EXISTING CLO INSTRUMENT. BECAUSE OF DIFFICULTIES WITH MAINTAINING AN INSTRUMENT AT MAUNA KEA WE WILL, IF OBSERVING CONDITIONS PROVE ADEQUATE, CONTINUE THIS LONG-TERM TIME SERIES FROM THE NEARBY MAUNA LOA SITE. IN ADDITION TO OUR WORK ON LONG-TERM VARIATIONS, WE WILL CONTINUE OUR ANALYSIS OF DIURNAL O3 VARIATIONS. UNDERSTANDING THESE VARIATIONS IS IMPORTANT FOR THE HOMOGENIZATION OF O3 RECORDS, SUCH AS THOSE FROM THE SBUV INSTRUMENTS, WHERE THE MEASUREMENTS ARE MADE AT VARIOUS TIMES OF DAY."

HOWEVER, MANY REEFS HAVE DETERIORATED DUE TO LOCAL HUMAN ACTIVITIES, AND THE REST MAY NOT BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND THE ADDED STRESSES BROUGHT BY CLIMATE CHANGE. PREDICTIONS ARE DIRE, BUT THE UNDERLYING DATA ARE SURPRISINGLY SPARSE. FOR THE HAWAIIAN ARCHIPELAGO, FROM THE BIG ISLAND TO KURE ATOLL, NO MORE THAN 5 PERCENT OF REEF AREA HAS BEEN QUANTITATIVELY SURVEYED IN THE PAST 10 YEARS. FURTHER, THE DATA THAT DO EXIST SHOW PATTERNS THAT ARE COUNTER TO PRESENT UNDERSTANDING OF HOW ENVIRONMENT IMPACTS REEFS. THE HYSPIRI PREPARATORY AIRBORNE ACTIVITIES BRINGING HIGH ALTITUDE AVIRIS FLIGHTS TO HAWAII IN 2016 IS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO FILL THE DATA GAP AND THEN TO REEVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CORAL REEF CONDITION AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS THAT ARE THOUGHT TO BE INFLUENTIAL. ADDITIONALLY, SINCE AVIRIS HAS PREVIOUSLY CONDUCTED A SIMILAR CAMPAIGN IN 2000, THERE IS VERY GOOD POTENTIAL TO INVESTIGATE HOW AT LEAST SOME OF HAWAII''S REEFS MAY HAVE CHANGED OVER A DECADE AND A HALF.  WE PROPOSE TO USE THE 2016 DATA TO QUANTIFY BENTHIC COVER AND PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY FOR ALL REEFS SURVEYED BY AVIRIS. WE WILL CONDUCT A MODEST FIELD STUDY IN KANEOHE BAY, OAHU FOR CALIBRATION AND VALIDATION OF THE REMOTE SENSING DATA AND PRODUCTS. WE WILL ANALYZE THE REMOTE SENSING DATA PRODUCTS AGAINST A SUITE OF BIO GEOPHYSICAL PARAMETERS READILY AVAILABLE FROM ANCILLARY SOURCES - OCEANOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS (SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE, SIGNIFICANT WAVE HEIGHT, ARAGONITE SATURATION), REEF GEOMORPHOLOGY AND AGE (INCREASING FROM THE BIG ISLAND TO KURE ATOLL), LAND COVER AND LAND-USE CHANGE, KNOWN PATTERNS OF BIODIVERSITY, AND LOCAL HUMAN THREATS (POLLUTION, DEVELOPMENT, OVERFISHING). PENDING AVAILABILITY AND SUITABILITY OF THE 2000 DATA SET, WE WILL INVESTIGATE HOW REEF CONDITION HAS CHANGED OVER TIME, AS WELL AS HOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REEF CONDITION AND THE ENVIRONMENT HAS CHANGED OVER TIME.  RESULTS WOULD BE IMPORTANT ON MANY LEVELS. ACHIEVING OUR OBJECTIVES REQUIRES DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A REMOTE SENSING DATA PROCESSING FLOW THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE MODIFIED FOR USE IN OTHER OPTICALLY SHALLOW WATER SYSTEMS BESIDES REEFS. THE MAPS OF REEF CONDITION WOULD PROVIDE A DENSE DATA SET OF REGION-SCALE REEF CONDITION, WHICH WOULD BE VALUABLE TO BOTH SCIENTISTS IN GENERAL AND HAWAII REEF MANAGERS IN PARTICULAR. THE ANALYSIS RELATING REEF CONDITION TO ENVIRONMENT WOULD PRODUCE A SET OF QUANTITATIVE, EMPIRICAL MODELS THAT CAN BE USED TO EVALUATE THE ROLES OF SPECIFIC DRIVERS OF CURRENT REEF CONDITION AND FORECAST REEF CONDITION UNDER PREDICTED SCENARIOS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. FINALLY, THE CHANGE ANALYSIS, WOULD BE, TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THE FIRST SYNOPTIC, AS OPPOSED TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF SMALL SITES, ANALYSIS OF CORAL REEF CHANGE AT THE REGION SCALE, POTENTIALLY IDENTIFYING BOTH BROAD REGIONAL TRENDS AND SITE-SPECIFIC AREAS OF CONCERN."

IT IS INCONTROVERTIBLY CLEAR THAT MANY REEFS ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DECLINE, OFTEN ATTRIBUTED TO DIRECT HUMAN IMPACTS. REEF ECOSYSTEMS MAY BE UNABLE TO WITHSTAND THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. HOWEVER, THE DATA ON  GLOBAL REEF CONDITION ARE VERY SPARSE: ONLY 0.01-0.1 OF THE WORLDS REEF AREA HAS BEEN SURVEYED, AND THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT GAP IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORAL REEFS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT. THE GOAL OF THE CORAL REEF AIRBORNE LABORATORY (CORAL) IS TO PROVIDE THE CRITICAL DATA AND NEW MODELS NEEDED TO ANALYZE THE STATUS OF CORAL REEFS AND TO PREDICT THEIR FUTURE. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, CORAL MAKES HIGH DENSITY OBSERVATIONS FOR A LARGE SAMPLE OF REEFS 8 PERCENT OF GLOBAL REEF AREA THAT OCCUR ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IMPLEMENTED IN EIGHT CAMPAIGNS ACROSS 10 CORAL REEF REGIONS IN THE INDIAN, PACIFIC, AND ATLANTIC OCEANS. CORAL ACQUIRES SPECTRAL IMAGE  DATA USING THE PORTABLE REMOTE IMAGING SPECTROMETER INSTRUMENT, OPERATED BY NASAS JET PROPULSION  LABORATORY, INSTALLED IN A POD UNDERNEATH A GULFSTREAM- III AIRPLANE, FLOWN BY NASAS JOHNSON SPACE CENTER. IN-WATER DATA ARE OBTAINED AT SELECT REEF SITES TO CALIBRATE AND VALIDATE THE REMOTE OBSERVATIONS AND PRODUCTS. FOR EACH REEF, THE SPECTRAL IMAGE DATA ARE PROCESSED TO PROVIDE THE REEF CONDITION DESCRIBED BY MEASURABLE QUANTITIES OF BENTHIC COVER OF CORAL, ALGAE, AND SAND PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; AND CALCIFICATION. CORAL IMAGE PRODUCTS ARE  ANALYZED AGAINST VALUES FOR BIOGEOPHYSICAL FORCINGS E.G. SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE, CARBONATE  CHEMISTRY, WHICH ARE ACQUIRED FROM PRE- EXISTING DATA SOURCES. THE RESULT IS A SET OF QUANTITATIVE, EMPIRICAL MODELS THAT CAN BE USED TO ESTIMATE CURRENT GLOBAL REEF CONDITION AND FORECAST REEF CONDITION UNDER SCENARIOS OF PREDICTED GLOBAL CHANGE. WITH THESE MODELS, SCIENTISTS,  RESOURCE MANAGERS, AND POLITICIANS CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW NATURAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC PROCESSES IMPACT REEFS, AND THUS MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS TOWARD THEIR CONSERVATION. CORAL OFFERS THE CLEAREST, MOST EXTENSIVE PICTURE TO DATE OF THE CONDITION OF A LARGE PORTION OF THE WORLDS CORAL REEFS FROM A UNIFORM DATA SET. THE DATA WILL REVEAL TRENDS BETWEEN CORAL REEF CONDITION AND  BIOGEOPHYSICAL FORCINGS, BOTH NATURAL AND THOSE ARISING FROM HUMAN ACTIVITIES. WITH THIS NEW UNDERSTANDING OF REEF CONDITION, WE CAN BETTER PREDICT THE FUTURE OF THIS GLOBAL ECOSYSTEM AND PROVIDE POLICY MAKERS WITH BETTER INFORMATION FOR THEIR DECISIONS REGARDING RESOURCE MANAGEMENT."

THUS, EXPOSURE TO MICROGRAVITY INDUCES MARKED BONE LOSS IN BOTH HUMANS AND ANIMALS, AND IS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR ASTRONAUTS EXPOSED TO LONG DURATION SPACEFLIGHT, AS THEY MAY BE AT INCREASED RISK FOR SKELETAL FRAGILITY AND BONE FRACTURES. MOST PRIOR STUDIES HAVE RELIED ON DUAL ENERGY XRAY ABSORPTIOMETRY (DXA), A 2D TECHNIQUE USED TO ASSESS BONE MASS AT DIFFERENT SKELETAL SITES, TO ASSESS EFFECTS OF SPACEFLIGHT ON BONE STRENGTH AND FRACTURE RISK. HOWEVER, DXA BASED MEASUREMENTS ARE LIMITED IN SEVERAL REGARDS. FIRST, WHOLE BONE STRENGTH IS DETERMINED BY BONE MASS, BONE GEOMETRY AND INTRINSIC PROPERTIES OF THE BONE MATRIX AND DXA IS ONLY ABLE TO ASSESS BONE MASS. SECOND, DXA MEASUREMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO TECHNICAL ARTIFACTS DUE TO OVERLYING STRUCTURES (E.G., AORTIC CALCIFICATION), DEGENERATIVE CHANGES (E.G., OSTEOPHYTES), AND DIFFERENCES IN BODY SIZE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND WITHIN AN INDIVIDUAL OVER TIME. THIRD, DXA MEASUREMENTS ARE INADEQUATE FOR IDENTIFYING MECHANISMS UNDERLYING SKELETAL FRAGILITY, AS THEY CANNOT DISTINGUISH CHANGES IN TRABECULAR VERSUS CORTICAL BONE. NEWER TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING 3D QUANTITATIVE COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (QCT) ARE ABLE TO OVERCOME THE LIMITATIONS OF DXA. MOREOVER, QCT IMAGES CAN BE USED TO ESTIMATE BONE STRENGTH USING A STANDARD ENGINEERING APPROACH CALLED FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS. INDEED, QCT IMAGES HAVE BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY TO DEMONSTRATE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SPACEFLIGHT ON HIP BONE DENSITY AND STRENGTH. HOWEVER, A SIMILAR EXAMINATION OF THE EFFECTS OF SPACEFLIGHT ON VERTEBRAL STRENGTH HAS NOT BEEN PERFORMED. THUS THE DEGREE OF SPINAL DECONDITIONING AND SUBSEQUENT RISK OF VERTEBRAL FRACTURE FOLLOWING LONG DURATION SPACEFLIGHT REMAINS UNKNOWN. OUR CENTRAL OBJECTIVE IS TO ADDRESS THIS GAP IN KNOWLEDGE BY ASSESSING CHANGES IN VOLUMETRIC BONE DENSITY AND STRENGTH OF LUMBAR VERTEBRAE USING PREVIOUSLY COLLECTED QCT SCANS FROM LONG DURATION ISS CREWMEMBERS. IN ADDITION, SINCE BONE FRACTURES OCCUR WHEN THE FORCES APPLIED TO THE BONE EXCEED ITS STRENGTH, WE WILL ALSO ESTIMATE THE RISK OF SPINE FRACTURE BY COMPUTING A LOAD TO STRENGTH RATIO IN EACH ASTRONAUT FOR DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. VERTEBRAL STRENGTH WILL BE MEASURED USING AN FDA APPROVED METHOD THAT EMPLOYS FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSES OF QCT SCANS, AND HAS BEEN VALIDATED AGAINST IN VITRO BONE STRENGTH TESTING AS WELL AS IN LARGE, POPULATION BASED STUDIES OF SPINE FRACTURE. WE WILL ESTIMATE LOADS APPLIED TO THE SPINE USING A MUSCULOSKELETAL MODEL OF THE LUMBAR AND THORACIC SPINE THAT CAN BE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE ASTRONAUTS HEIGHT, WEIGHT, SPINAL SHAPE AND SPECIFIC TRUNK MUSCLE ANATOMY ALL FACTORS THAT ARE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS TO SPINAL LOADING. THIS WORK IS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT TO NASA AS BONE LOSS AND INCREASED FRACTURE RISK FOLLOWING LONG DURATION SPACEFLIGHT REMAIN KEY OPERATIONAL CONCERNS. SPECIFICALLY, THE PROPOSAL DIRECTLY ADDRESSES SEVERAL RISKS OUTLINES IN THE HUMAN RESEARCH PROGRAM (HRP) PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT FROM 2009  1) RISK OF INJURY FROM DYNAMIC LOADS 2) RISK OF BONE FRACTURE AND 3) RISK OF EARLY ONSET OSTEOPOROSIS DUE TO SPACEFLIGHT.  FURTHER, THE PROPOSED WORK ADDRESSES SEVERAL GAPS IDENTIFIED IN THE INTEGRATED RESEARCH PLAN, INCLUDING 1) OP5 WE DO NOT KNOW THE EXTENT TO WHICH SPACEFLIGHT DECONDITIONING DECREASES INJURY TOLERANCE FOR DYNAMIC LOADS 2) FRACTURE 3 WE NEED A VALIDATED METHOD TO ESTIMATE THE RISK OF FRACTURE BY EVALUATING THE RATIO OF APPLIED LOADS TO BONE FRACTURE LOADS AND 3) OSTEO 3 WE NEED A VALIDATED CLINICALLY RELEVANT METHOD FOR ASSESSING THE EFFECT OF SPACEFLIGHT ON OSTEOPOROSIS OR FRACTURE RISK IN LONG DURATION ASTRONAUTS. IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECTS OF SPACEFLIGHT ON VERTEBRAL FRAGILITY AND SPINAL LOADING WILL ALLOW DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE COUNTERMEASURES TO REDUCE THE RISK OF BONE FRACTURE IN ASTRONAUTS, AND MAY LEAD TO IMPROVEMENTS IN ASSESSMENT OF SPINE FRACTURE RISK IN OLDER ADULTS."

THUS, DESPITE RIGOROUS EXERCISE PROTOCOLS AND OTHER COUNTERMEASURES, MUSCLE ATROPHY AND BONE LOSS ARE STILL VIRTUALLY INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCES OF SPACEFLIGHT. ONE APPROACH FOR AMELIORATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE UNTOWARD CONSEQUENCES OF SPACE TRAVEL IS BY THE INDUCTION OF ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY DURING SPACEFLIGHT VIA CENTRIFUGATION. THE STRENGTH OF THE ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY DEPENDS BOTH ON THE SPEED OF ROTATION AND DIAMETER OF THE SHIP. WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE EQUIVALENT 1.0G, IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT LOWER LEVELS OF FORCE MAY ALSO BE EFFECTIVE FOR PREVENTING MUSCLE ATROPHY AND IRREVERSIBLE BONE LOSS. IN THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSE TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY FOR THE PREVENTION OF MUSCLE ATROPHY AND WEAKNESS AND BONE LOSS BY STUDYING RATS USING AN INNOVATIVE SYSTEM FOR PARTIAL UNLOADING THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED PREVIOUSLY FOR MICE BY MEMBERS OF OUR TEAM. WE WILL STUDY THE MUSCULOSKELETAL RESPONSE OF ADULT MALE RATS (N=L 4 I GROUP) FOLLOWING EXPOSURE TO DIFFERENT DEGREES OF UNLOADING REPRESENTING 0.2G, 0.4G, AND 0. 7G AS WELL AS FULLY LOADED ANIMALS FOR 1, 2 AND 4 WEEKS.

IN ADDITION, WE WILL PERFORM BOTH SEROLOGICAL AND TISSUE MOLECULAR ANALYSES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS AND TIME COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT OF THESE CHANGES AT DIFFERENT DEGREES OF UNLOADING.

IN THE LAST DECADE, IT APPEARS THAT NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY (NPP) IN THE AO HAS INCREASED CONSIDERABLY, AS ESTIMATED FROM REMOTELY-SENSED OBSERVATIONS; HOWEVER, WE DO NOT YET HAVE SUFFICIENT SPATIAL DATA COVERAGE TO VALIDATE SUCH TRENDS OVER THE ENTIRE AO. ALTHOUGH ARCTIC MARINE NPP IS STRONGLY SEASONAL, SOME ARCTIC SHELF SEAS RANK AMONG THE MOST PRODUCTIVE REGIONS IN THE WORLD OCEAN, WHEREAS MEAN NPP IN DEEP AO BASINS IS AMONG THE LOWEST. THROUGH BOTTOMUP FORCING IN THE FOOD WEB, MARINE NPP CONSTRAINS PELAGIC AND BENTHIC HIGHER TROPHIC LEVELS,INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT NATIONAL AND LOCAL COMMUNITY FISHERIES. THEREFORE, CHANGES IN NPP ARE LIKELY TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ARCTIC''S LIVING MARINE RESOURCES AND MANY BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES. HOWEVER, CONSENSUS ABOUT THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF VARIABLES AND PROCESSES CONTROLLING NPP IN THE AO AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND IN DIFFERENT REGIONS IS LACKING. SEA ICE, COLORED DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER, AND STRATIFICATION ARE THE MAJOR CONTROLS OF THE LIGHT REGIME FOR PHYTOPLANKTON WHILE WINTER WIND MIXING, UPWELLING, EDDIES, RIVER DISCHARGE AND STRATIFICATION ARE INVOLVED IN NUTRIENT REPLENISHMENT. GIVEN PROJECTED HIGH SENSITIVITY OF THE AO TO CLIMATE CHANGE, COMBINED WITH THE OBSERVED CONTEMPORARY CHANGES, A REGIONAL AO PP ASSESSMENT WILL PROVIDE AN ESSENTIAL STEP FORWARD IN THIS REGION. WE PROPOSE TO CONDUCT A PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY ALGORITHM ROUND ROBIN ACTIVITY (PPARR) AS A FRAMEWORK IN WHICH THE SKILL AND SENSITIVITIES OF NPP MODELS IN THE AO, INCLUDING BOTH SATELLITE NPP MODELS AND COUPLED BIOGEOCHEMICAL-CIRCULATION MODELS, CAN BE ASSESSED THROUGH MULTIPLE TYPES OF COMPARISONS. REGIONAL NPP MODELS ARE BECOMING AVAILABLE FOR THE AO AND HELPING TO UNDERSTAND THE BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF THIS REGION, ESPECIALLY AT TIMES AND IN SECTORS WHERE FIELD SAMPLING IS DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, DUE TO EXTREMELY HARSH CONDITIONS OR DIPLOMATIC LACK OF ACCESS TO MAJOR PORTIONS OF THE AO. MOST OCEAN COLOR MODELS ESTIMATE NPP FROM CONCENTRATIONS OF SURFACE CHLOROPHYLL-A, WHICH IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN THE AO WHERE THE HETEROGENEITY IN SPACE AND TIME OF THE AVAILABLE IN SITU CHLOROPHYLL-A AND NPP DATA MAKE THE EXTENSIVE COVERAGE OF SATELLITE DATA PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE. HOWEVER, THE AO PRESENTS SEVERAL OBSTACLES TO REMOTE SENSING OF OCEAN COLOR AND DERIVATION OF ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF SURFACE CHLOROPHYLL-A, SUCH AS SEA ICE, CLOUD COVER, LAND-DERIVED RIVER-BORNE COLORED DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER, DEEP SUBSURFACE CHLOROPHYLL-A MAXIMA, AND CLIMATE CHANGE. OUR PROPOSED PPARR5 WILL INCLUDE A COMPARISON OF 20-30 OCEAN COLOR, BIOGEOCHEMICAL OCEAN CIRCULATION MODELS, AND 7-10 FULLY-COUPLED EARTH SYSTEM MODELS CONTRIBUTING TO THE FIFTH ASSESSMENT OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (IPCC). MODEL ESTIMATES OF NPP WILL BE COMPARED TO EACH OTHER IN TERMS OF BIAS AND VARIABILITY. AVERAGE AND INDIVIDUAL MODEL SKILL WILL BE ASSESSED ON A REGIONSPECIFIC BASIS (E.G., NERITIC VERSUS PELAGIC) BY COMPARING ESTIMATES OF INTEGRATED AND DEPTH-SPECIFIC NPP TO IN SITU 14C MEASUREMENTS. NEXT, THE EFFECT OF DEEP CHLOROPHYLL-A MAXIMUM ON INTEGRATED VS. SURFACE NPP WILL BE DETERMINED. FINALLY, WE WILL COMPARE PROJECTIONS OF NPP UP TO THE YEAR 2100 FOR THE AO FROM THE EARTH SYSTEM MODELS UNDER THE CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS IN THE FIFTH IPCC ASSESSMENT.

OVER THE PAST 100 YEARS, HIGH NORTHERN LATITUDE REGIONS HAVE EXPERIENCED MORE RAPID WARMING THAN ELSEWHERE ON EARTH. THIS TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE OVER THE NEXT CENTURY AND AS SUCH, ARCTIC ECOSYSTEMS HAVE BECOME AN INTENSE FOCUS OF CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH. IN ADDITION TO THIS REGION BEING CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO OUR UNDERSTANDING AND MODELING OF KEY BIOLOGICAL AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES, AND SHORT-TERM CLIMATE FORCINGS AND FEEDBACK LOOPS THAT POTENTIALLY ACCELERATE LOCAL WARMING, ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE IN THE ARCTIC IS INCREASINGLY AFFECTING SOCIETY IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. WHILE THERE IS A LEGACY OF RESEARCH ON THE NATURE AND EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE ARCTIC, MAJOR GAPS REMAIN IN UNDERSTANDING THE VULNERABILITY, RESPONSE AND RESILIENCE OF ARCTIC COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS TO CONTINUED ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCES. WITH A FOCUS ON COASTAL OCEAN PROCESSES, THE PROPOSED CAMPAIGN WILL PROVIDE A CRITICALLY NEEDED LINKAGE BETWEEN PAST FIELD CAMPAIGNS FOCUSING ON THE ARCTIC OPEN OCEAN ENVIRONMENT, SUCH AS NASA''S ICESCAPE PROJECT, AND OTHER PAST AND ON-GOING FIELD ACTIVITIES FOCUSING ON ARCTIC RIVER PROCESSES, CHEMISTRY AND FLUXES. A KEY COMPONENT OF THE PROPOSED FIELD CAMPAIGN WILL BE THE USE OF SPATIALTEMPORAL INFORMATION PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM REMOTELY-SENSED DATA TO EXTEND OBSERVATIONS TO LARGER SPATIAL AND LONGER TEMPORAL SCALES, AND THE PROPOSED INTEGRATION OF SATELLITE AND FIELD OBSERVATIONS WITH COUPLED PHYSICAL-BIOGEOCHEMICAL MODELS FOR PREDICTING IMPACTS OF FUTURE PRESSURES ON ARCTIC, COASTAL OCEAN, BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES. AT THE INCEPTION OF OUR SCOPING EFFORTS, THE STUDY REGIONS WILL BE THE CONTINENTAL MARGIN AND COASTAL OCEAN OFF THE MACKENZIE AND YUKON RIVERS. THESE TWO DRAINAGE BASINS PROVIDE THE LARGEST DISCHARGE AND THE LARGEST FLUXES OF DISSOLVED AND PARTICULATE CARBON TO THE ARCTIC OCEAN FROM THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTINENT. FURTHER, THESE TENTATIVE LOCATIONS MINIMIZE THE TEMPORAL GAP WITH THE NASA-FUNDED ICESCAPE (CURRENTLY IN ITS FINAL STAGES) WHILE COORDINATING AND LEVERAGING DIRECTLY WITH THE UPCOMING MULTIDISCIPLINARY NASA FIELD CAMPAIGN ABOVE (ARCTIC-BOREAL VULNERABILITY EXPERIMENT) THAT AIMS AT BETTER UNDERSTANDING DRIVERS AND CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN ARCTIC TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS. THROUGH ORGANIZATION OF TWO DEDICATED WORKSHOPS AND PRESENTATIONS AT NASA OCEAN BIOLOGY AND BIOGEOCHEMISTRY (OBB) SCIENCE TEAM MEETINGS, THE PROPOSED SCOPING STUDY WILL ENGAGE THE BROADER SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND INVITE PARTICIPATION OF EXPERTS FROM A WIDE RANGE OF DISCIPLINES (INCLUDING PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES), TO REFINE OUR RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND OUTLINE DETAILED RESEARCH STRATEGIES NEEDED TO ATTAIN THESE OBJECTIVES. THE SCOPING STUDY WILL ALSO INVOLVE INTERAGENCY AND INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS. THE DELIVERABLE WILL BE A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT TO NASA OUTLINING THE MAJOR SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS, AND DEVELOPING THE INITIAL STUDY DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION CONCEPT FOR THIS NEW NASA OBB FIELD CAMPAIGN. THE PROPOSED CAMPAIGN IS STRONGLY RELEVANT TO NASA''S OBB OVERARCHING PROGRAMMATIC GOALS, AND IS PARTICULARLY TIMELY AS IT CORRESPONDS WITH THE RELEASE OF THE NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR THE ARCTIC REGION IN MAY 2013, WHICH INCLUDES AS ITS PRIORITY PROTECTION OF THE ARCTIC ENVIRONMENT AND THE CALL TO INCREASE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ARCTIC THROUGH SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE."

SPECIFICALLY, WE HAVE FIVE OBJECTIVES: 1) DEFINE THE IMPORTANT SCALES OF VARIABILITY OF PIC BY COMPARING RESULTS FROM MODIS AND MISR SENSORS (THE FORMER HAS 1KM RESOLUTION, THE LATTER HAS 275M RESOLUTION), 2) ADDRESS WHETHER PIC HAS SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED OVER THE MODIS MISSIONS, BOTH GLOBALLY AND REGIONALLY (IN THE LONGHURST BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROVINCES), 3) EXAMINE WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES IN THE ANNUAL PHENOLOGY (TIME OF ANNUAL BLOOM AND SENESCENCE) OF COCCOLITHOPHORES, ON A GLOBAL OR REGIONAL BASIS, 4) ASSESS WHETHER THE TURNOVER OF PIC (SET BY PRODUCTION RATES MINUS LOSS RATES ASSOCIATED WITH GRAZING, DISSOLUTION, AND SINKING) HAS VARIED OVER THE PERIOD OF THE MODIS MISSIONS, AND 5) DETERMINE WHETHER THE GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION OF COCCOLITHOPHORE PIC IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION OF HYDROGRAPHIC FRONTS AND WHETHER BLOOM TIMING IS BEING AFFECTED BY MAJOR WIND EVENTS AND CHANGES THEREOF. UNDER THE RUBRIC OF \""CARBON CYCLE&ECOSYSTEMS,\"" THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED WORK FOCUSES ON THE CYCLING OF CARBON WITHIN THE OCEAN, SPECIFICALLY BY ONE FUNCTIONAL GROUP, THE CALCIFIERS. ELUCIDATION OF LONG-TERM TRENDS AND CHANGES IN PHENOLOGY WILL HAVE STRONG RELEVANCE TO OCEAN BIOGEOCHEMISTRY, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF PIC TO THE RATE OF THE BIOLOGICAL PUMP. OUR APPLICATION OF MISR TO COCCOLITHOPHORE STUDIES WILL ALLOW SMALLER-SCALE MEASUREMENTS OF BLOOMS AT #tilde#1/4 THE SPATIAL SCALE OF MODIS, WHICH WILL PROVIDE INSIGHTS ABOUT THE VARIOUS PHYSICAL PROCESSES AFFECTING THEIR DISTRIBUTION IN SPACE AND TIME. THE ADVENT OF AQUARIUS SALINITY DATA, WHEN COMBINED WITH MODIS SST DATA, NOW ALLOWS THE ESTIMATION OF SEA SURFACE DENSITY AND, USING GRADIENT FINDING ALGORITHMS, WILL ALLOW US TO DETERMINE WHETHER STEEP GRADIENTS IN COCCOLITHOPHORE DENSITY FALL AT MAJOR OCEAN HYDROGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES. VARIOUS OTHER DATA SETS AVAILABLE FROM THE CURRENT CONSTELLATION OF EARTH OBSERVING SATELLITES (E.G., WIND SPEED) WILL ALSO ALLOW BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPORTANCE OF FRONTAL BOUNDARIES AND WIND MIXING (USING AMSR-E; AQUARIUS), AS THEY INFLUENCE GLOBAL CALCITE PRODUCTION IN THE SEA. THIS PROPOSED WORK DIRECTLY FOCUSES ON TWO OF NASA''S FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS IN EARTH SCIENCE: (A) \""HOW IS THE GLOBAL EARTH SYSTEM CHANGING?\"" AND (B) \""WHAT ARE THE SOURCES OF CHANGE IN THE EARTH SYSTEM, THEIR MAGNITUDES, AND TRENDS?\"" THE WORK ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO OTHER CRITICAL NASA EARTH SCIENCE GOALS: TO QUANTIFY GLOBAL PRODUCTIVITY, BIOMASS, AND CARBON FLUXES; AND TO UNDERSTAND HOW MARINE ECOSYSTEMS (OF WHICH PIC IS A MAJOR PART OF THE GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE) ARE CHANGING. THIS RESEARCH WILL YIELD NEW KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE TURNOVER WITHIN THE CARBONATE SYSTEM AS OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS RESPOND TO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE."""

WE PROPOSE TO USE A COMBINATION OF SATELLITE AND GNATS DATA (SHIPBOARD AND AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE MEASUREMENTS) TO CONSTRAIN A COUPLED PHYSICAL/ECOSYSTEM MODEL OF THE GOM CARBON CYCLE. THE OVERALL SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS IS THAT GNATS HAS PROVIDED CRITICAL CALIBRATION/VALIDATION DATA FOR SEAWIFS, MODIS, AND VIIRS SENSORS, AS WELL AS INSIGHTS ABOUT THE LONG-TERM OCEANOGRAPHIC CARBON CYCLE CHANGES IN THE GOM, A SEMI-ENCLOSED SHELF SEA, WITH STRONG LAND-SEA CONNECTIONS VIA 25 SURROUNDING WATERSHEDS. WE DIRECT THIS PROPOSAL TO THE SECOND RESEARCH THEME OF THE NASA ROSES 13 CARBON CYCLE SCIENCE PROGRAM: CARBON DYNAMICS ALONG TERRESTRIAL-AQUATIC INTERFACES, INCLUDING LAND-OCEAN, LAND-FRESHWATER, AND COASTAL OCEAN REGIONS. THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE MAJOR IMPORTANCE OF RIVER RUNOFF TO THE PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, OPTICAL AND BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY OF THE GOM, INCLUDING ITS CARBON CYCLE. THIS WORK IS PRIMARILY RELEVANT TO NASA (GIVEN THE NASA-CENTRIC GNATS SAMPLING) AND SECONDARILY TO NOAA, SPECIFICALLY FOR WORK ON PRODUCTIVITY, ALGAL BIOMASS, AND PHYTOPLANKTON FUNCTIONAL GROUPS OF U. S. COASTAL WATERS, AS WELL AS CALIBRATION/VALIDATION OF THE NPP/VIIRS SENSOR. ALONG WITH A WHOLE HOST OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES, GNATS MEASURES ALL FOUR PARTS OF THE MARINE CARBON CYCLE: PARTICULATE ORGANIC CARBON (POC), PARTICULATE INORGANIC CARBON (PIC; CALCITE), DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC), AND DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON (DIC; E.G., CO2, HCO3-, AND CO3=, WHICH ARE COUPLED TO PH AND ALKALINITY). THESE FOUR PARTS OF THE CARBON CYCLE (INCLUDING RESERVOIRS AND FLUXES) PROVIDE INSIGHTS ABOUT THE MAJOR PROCESSES AFFECTING THE COASTAL OCEAN, FROM CHANGES IN PRODUCTIVITY (I.E. POC VARIABILITY THROUGH TIME ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN HYDROGRAPHY, DIFFERENT PHYTOPLANKTON FUNCTIONAL GROUPS, ETC.), LAND-SEA CARBON TRANSPORT (I.E. DOC AND POC VARIABILITY CAUSED BY MAJOR RIVERINE FLOOD EVENTS AND DROUGHTS), AND CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH OCEAN ACIDIFICATION (I.E. VARIABILITY IN DIC AND PIC CAUSED BY CHANGES IN CARBONATE SATURATION). SIMPLY PUT, THE ONLY WAY TO PREDICT CHANGES TO ALL FOUR PARTS OF THE MARINE CARBON CYCLE AS A FUNCTION OF LONG-TERM CLIMATE CHANGE WILL BE THROUGH A COMBINED MEASUREMENT AND MODELING APPROACH. THE ECOSYSTEM MODEL TO BE USED FOR THE GULF OF MAINE CARBON CYCLE CONSISTS OF SIZE-STRUCTURED CARBON POOLS OF DETRITAL MATERIAL, PHYTOPLANKTON FUNCTIONAL TYPES RANGING FROM PICOPLANKTON TO MICROPLANKTON, AND A SIZE-BASED ZOOPLANKTON PREDATOR GROUP. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN COMPONENTS WILL BE DETERMINED BY BOTH SIZE AND FUNCTIONAL ROLE, AND THE MODEL WILL BE FORCED BY GOM PHYSICAL CONDITIONS. WE WILL VALIDATE THE MODEL AGAINST GNATS DATA, AND TEST THE ABILITY OF REMOTELY-SENSED PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS, COUPLED WITH THE ECOSYSTEM MODEL, TO REPRODUCE THE OBSERVED DYNAMICS. WE WILL THEN USE THE MODEL TO TEST HYPOTHESES REGARDING THE FATE OF CARBON RESULTING FROM CLIMATE-DRIVEN CHANGES SUCH AS INCREASED PRECIPITATION AND TEMPERATURE. ANTICIPATED SCIENTIFIC OUTCOMES FROM THIS WORK WILL BE A) A LONGER DURATION, NASA-CENTRIC, COASTAL TIME SERIES THAT CAN RESOLVE CLIMATOLOGICAL PHENOMENA SPANNING TIME SCALES OF DAYS TO DECADES AND B) A COUPLED PHYSICAL/ECOSYSTEM MODEL BASED ON GNATS THAT USES REMOTELY-SENSED, SHIP AND AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE DATA TO CONSTRAIN THE MODEL AND TEST HYPOTHESES RELEVANT TO EACH PART OF THE GOM CARBON CYCLE AND THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE."

TO DATE, THE PIC ALGORITHM HAS BEEN BASED ON AN EVER-INCREASING, BUT STILL RELATIVELY SMALL, SET OF FIELD MEASUREMENTS (SMALL AS COMPARED TO THE CHLOROPHYLL A VALIDATION DATA SET, WHICH CONTAINS #tilde#350X MORE DATA SIMPLY BECAUSE MORE INVESTIGATORS HAVE SAMPLED IT OVER THE YEARS AND CHLOROPHYLL ANALYSES ARE CHEAPER TO RUN). THE MERGED TWO-BAND/THREE-BAND ALGORITHM IS FUNDAMENTALLY A CASE I ALGORITHM; THAT IS, IT IS DESIGNED FOR AREAS WHERE SUSPENDED SEDIMENTS,RIVER-BORN SEDIMENTS OR COLORED DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OCEAN OPTICAL PROPERTIES. THE PIC ALGORITHM ACCOUNTS FOR 78% OF THE VARIANCE IN FIELD-MEASURED PIC AND THE STANDARD ERROR OF PIC DETERMINATIONS (COMPARED TO SHIPBOARD VALIDATION DATA) IS +/-0.08MMOL M^-3, COMPARABLE TO THE PIC CONCENTRATIONS FOUND IN OLIGOTROPHIC GYRES. BUT THERE IS STILL CONSIDERABLE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE PIC ALGORITHM. THESE STATISTICS CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED IF THE SATELLITE DATA ARE BINNED IN SPACE AND TIME (RELATIVELY EASY TO DO WITH SATELLITE DATA, BUT THIS OBVIOUSLY COMPROMISES TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION). IN CASE I WATERS, ERRORS IN THE ALGORITHM RESULT FROM: (A) THE CALCITE-SPECIFIC BACKSCATTERING CROSS-SECTION ATTRIBUTED TO COCCOLITHOPHORES; (B) ERRORS IN THE CHLOROPHYLL-DEPENDENT BACKSCATTERING ATTRIBUTED TO PHYTOPLANKTON; AND (C) PRESENCE OF OTHER SCATTERING MINERALS, SUCH AS BIOGENIC SILICA FROM DIATOM FRUSTULES, WHICH DO NOT SCATTER AS INTENSELY AS PIC, BUT NONETHELESS CAN CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANT OPTICAL BACKSCATTERING. I PROPOSE TO CONTINUE EVALUATING NEW DATA SETS FOR PIC (GENERATED FROM OTHER ONGOING STUDIES) IN ORDER TO REVISE PIC ALGORITHM COEFFICIENTS AND LOOK-UP TABLES. REGARDING THE FIRST SOURCE OF ERROR, I WILL FOCUS ON BETTER DEFINING THE BACKSCATTERING CROSS-SECTION OF CALCITE COCCOLITHS GEOGRAPHICALLY. IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR ESTIMATE OF THE BACKSCATTERING CROSS-SECTION FOR CALCITE COCCOLITHS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF THE PIC ALGORITHM. REGARDING THE SECOND SOURCE OF ERROR, I WILL EXPERIMENT WITH NEW ALGORITHMS FOR DERIVING CHLOROPHYLL CONCENTRATION (E.G., THE REFLECTANCE DIFFERENCING ALGORITHM OF HU ET AL., 2012). THIS WILL PROVIDE A BETTER DERIVATION OF THE BACKSCATTERING ASSOCIATED WITH CHLOROPHYLL CONTAINING PHYTOPLANKTON, WHICH, IN TURN, WILL ALLOW IMPROVED ESTIMATES OF PIC. THIS WORK WILL BE IN COLLABORATION WITH DR. CHUAMIN HU (UNIV. SOUTH FLORIDA). REGARDING THE THIRD SOURCE OF ERROR, I WILL CORRECT FOR THE PRESENCE OF BIOGENIC SILICA, WHICH IS UBIQUITOUS OVER THE GLOBE AND A POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT LIGHT SCATTERING CONTRIBUTOR IN ITS OWN RIGHT. MOREOVER, BIOGENIC SILICA CAN NOW BE ESTIMATED REMOTELY (BALCH ET AL., 2010). ACCOUNTING FOR THIS COMPONENT OF THE BACKSCATTERING SIGNAL WILL ALLOW BETTER ESTIMATES OF PIC BACKSCATTERING AND DERIVATION OF PIC CONCENTRATION. I WILL COMPARE ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION FOR BOTH MODIS AQUA AND MODIS TERRA SATELLITES AND PERFORM FULL ERROR ANALYSES OF THE REVISED ALGORITHM IN THE INTEREST OF PROVIDING SEAMLESS, CLIMATE-QUALITY, PIC DATA. ALTHOUGH THE FOCUS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS ON CONTINUITY OF THE TERRA AND AQUA PIC PRODUCT, THE ALGORITHM CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO VIIRS IMAGERY. DR. HOWARD GORDON (UNIV. MIAMI) WILL BE COLLABORATING ON THE OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE REVISED PIC ALGORITHM. THE OUTCOME OF THIS ALGORITHM MAINTENANCE WORK WILL BE AN IMPROVED PIC PRODUCT WITH LOWER RMS ERROR."

THIS ALGORITHM IS CRITICAL FOR UNDERSTANDING THE GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION OF  COCCOLITHOPHORES (CALCIFYING PHYTOPLANKTON) AND UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON  THESE ORGANISMS, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE FUNCTIONING OF THE OCEAN BIOLOGICAL PUMP.  THIS WORK  HAS THREE CENTRAL OBJECTIVES:   A) PIC ALGORITHM IMPROVEMENTS:  THERE ARE SEVERAL SOURCES OF ERROR  WITHIN THE PIC ALGORITHM THAT NEED IMPROVEMENT: DERIVATION OF THE DIFFUSE ATTENUATION COEFFICIENT  USED IN THE MODEL, DETERMINATION OF THE COCCOLITH BACKSCATTERING CROSS-SECTION AND DERIVATION OF  THE BACKSCATTERING ATTRIBUTABLE TO PHYTOPLANKTON CHLOROPHYLL.  THIS PROPOSED WORK WILL INVESTIGATE  ALL THREE ASPECTS WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR AN IMPROVED VIIRS PIC ALGORITHM. THIS WORK ALSO WILL RESULT  IN AN UPDATED PIC ALGORITHM THEORETICAL BASIS DOCUMENT (ATBD).   B) PIC ALGORITHM EVALUATION:  THE  MAJOR CHALLENGE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF THE PIC ALGORITHM IN THE SUOMI NPP ERA IS THE STILL-LIMITED  SEA-TRUTH PIC DATA TAKEN SINCE THE LAUNCH OF NPP IN OCTOBER, 2011, AVAILABLE FOR PRODUCT  EVALUATION. THE PIC ALGORITHM HAS BEEN BASED ON AN EVER-INCREASING, BUT STILL RELATIVELY SMALL, SET  OF FIELD MEASUREMENTS (SMALL AS COMPARED TO THE CHLOROPHYLL VALIDATION DATA SET, WHICH CONTAINS  #tilde#350X MORE DATA SIMPLY BECAUSE MORE INVESTIGATORS HAVE SAMPLED IT FOR SEVERAL MORE DECADES).

THE WORK PROPOSED HERE  WILL INVOLVE A MODEST FIELD VALIDATION EFFORT (240 STATIONS WITHIN THE NORTH AND SOUTH ATLANTIC) TO  AUGMENT THE FIELD PIC DATA AVAILABLE FOR EVALUATION OF THE VIIRS PIC PRODUCT. WE PROPOSE TO  PARTICIPATE IN THREE ATLANTIC MERIDIONAL TRANSECT CRUISES FROM VASTLY UNDER-SAMPLED REGIONS OF THE  NORTH AND SOUTH ATLANTIC, SPECIFICALLY IN SUPPORT OF THE SUOMI NPP MISSION.  THIS WORK WILL PROVIDE  COLLECTION/ANALYSIS OF OTHER VARIABLES, TOO: CHLOROPHYLL CONCENTRATION AND PARTICULATE ORGANIC  CARBON (POC), INHERENT OPTICAL PROPERTIES (IOPS; E.G. PARTICLE ABSORPTION AND SCATTERING) AND  APPARENT OPTICAL PROPERTIES (AOPS; FOR VALIDATING VIIRS NORMALIZED WATER-LEAVING RADIANCE  MEASUREMENTS), ALL IN SUPPORT OF THEIR EVALUATION AS VIIRS EDRS AND CDRS.  NASA WILL INCUR NO SHIP  TIME EXPENSES FOR THE FIELD WORK; ALL THREE CRUISES ARE PART OF THE ATLANTIC MERIDIONAL TRANSECT  PROGRAM, LONG SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF THE U.K.  C) CONTINUITY  OF THE PIC SCIENCE DATA PRODUCT:  THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO SEAMLESSLY TRANSITION THE  PIC SCIENCE DATA PRODUCT FROM THE EOS ERA TO THE SUOMI NPP ERA (AND ULTIMATELY TO THE JPSS AND PACE  ERAS).  CRITICAL IN THIS GOAL IS DEFINING THE ERROR BUDGETS OF THE VIIRS PIC ALGORITHM FOR  COMPARISON TO THE SAME PRODUCT DERIVED FROM MODIS AND TRACEABLE TO THE ATBD.  THIS WORK WILL BE  WELL-COORDINATED WITH THE OCEAN SCIENCE INVESTIGATOR-LED PROCESSING SYSTEMS (OCEAN SIPS).

DURING MUCH OF EARTH''S HISTORY, PROBABLY STARTING AROUND 3 BILLION YEARS AGO, WHEN O2 LEVELS WERE MUCH LOWER OR FLUCTUATED BETWEEN OXIC AND ANOXIC CONDITIONS, THE OCEANS WERE REPLETE WITH FERROUS IRON. IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT FEOB FLOURISHED. THESE BACTERIA COULD HAVE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN SHAPING CONDITIONS FOR LIFE ON THE EARLY EARTH, FURTHERMORE, DUE TO THE OVERALL ABUNDANCE OF IRON ON PLANETS AND PLANETARY BODIES, FE REDOX CHEMISTRY COULD BE A FUNDAMENTAL METABOLISM FOR EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT AS A CONSEQUENCE OF MICROBIAL GROWTH ON IRON AT CIRCUMNEUTRAL PH, FEOB PRODUCE UNIQUE ORGANO-METALLIC NANO-AND MICRO-STRUCTURES THAT ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE ROCK RECORD, FORMING A BIOSIGNATURE FOR THEIR EXISTENCE AND ACTIVITY. NONETHELESS, OXYGEN-DEPENDENT FE-OXIDATION AT CIRCUMNEUTRAL PH REMAINS AMONG THE LEAST WELL UNDERSTOOD MAJOR LITHOTROPHIC METABOLISMS ON EARTH.

WITHIN THIS CONTEXT, A MAJOR TECHNICAL CHALLENGE WILL BE DEVELOPMENT OF A ROBUST PIPELINE FOR ANALYZING SINGLE CELL TRANSCRIPTOMES FROM BACTERIA. SINGLE CELL TRANSCRIPTOMICS IS A NOVEL APPROACH THAT WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION, NOT ONLY ABOUT THE GENETIC POTENTIAL OF UNCULTIVATED MICROBES, BUT ALSO ABOUT WHAT GENES THEY ARE ACTUALLY EXPRESSING, PROVIDING DIRECT INSIGHT TO IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS THE BACTERIA ARE CARRYING OUT. IN ADDITION, IN TARGETING A POORLY UNDERSTOOD METABOLISM LIKE FE-OXIDATION, TRANSCRIPTOMIC ANALYSIS MAY PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION AS TO THE SPECIFIC GENES OR GENE FAMILIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN ENERGY CONSERVATION FROM FE-OXIDATION. WHILE THE SINGLE CELL GENOMICS CENTER AT BIGELOW HAS PROVEN ITS SUCCESS AT ACQUIRING DNA AND GENOMIC SEQUENCES FROM SINGLE CELLS, THE ACQUISITION OF MRNA AND DETERMINATION OF MRNA SEQUENCES HAS NOT BEEN DONE BEFORE ON ENVIRONMENTAL MICROORGANISMS. THUS, THIS APPROACH WILL OFFER SEVERAL TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES THAT, IF SUCCESSFULLY MET, WILL GREATLY ENHANCE OUR CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND DIVERSE MICROBIAL METABOLISMS, INDEPENDENT OF OUR ABILITY TO CULTIVATE THE MICROBES RESPONSIBLE. IN ADDITION TO THIS SINGLE CELL TRANSCRIPTOMICS APPROACH, WORK WILL CONTINUE WITH THE EXPLORATION OF GENOMES FROM CURRENTLY AVAILABLE SINGLE AMPLIFIED GENOMES OF BOTH FRESHWATER AND MARINE FEOB, AS WELL AS ANALYSIS OF IN-SITU HABITATS USING MORE CONVENTIONAL METAGENOMIC AND METATRANSCRIPTOME METHODS. DUE TO THE UNIQUE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF THESE TWO MAJOR GROUPS OF FE-OXIDIZERS, THIS KIND OF COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS COULD WELL INFORM US ABOUT MODES OF MICROBIAL EVOLUTION RELATED TO IRON METABOLISM. THE FEOB ARE AN EXCELLENT GROUP OF MICROBES TO TEST THESE METHODS ON DUE TO THEIR UNIQUE PHYSIOLOGY, DIVERSE, BUT CONSERVED PHYLOGENY AND EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY, AS WELL THERE BEING A GROUP OF CULTURED REPRESENTATIVES WITHIN A MUCH LARGER GROUP OF UNCULTIVATED MEMBERS.

THE POTENTIAL FOR THESE RIBOZYME ACTIVITIES TO SUPPORT LIFE PRIOR TO CODED PROTEIN SYNTHESIS DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON THEIR MERE EXISTENCE, BUT ALSO ON THEIR ABUNDANCE WITHIN RANDOM SEQUENCE SPACE, THE MINIMAL LENGTH NEEDED FOR FUNCTION, AND THE EFFICIENCY AND FIDELITY WITH WHICH THESE FUNCTIONS CAN BE CARRIED OUT. ALL OF THE ABOVE FACTORS ARE COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT THEY NOT ONLY DEPEND ON THE PROPERTIES OF RNA, BUT THEY ALSO DEPEND UPON THE ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THESE FUNCTIONS EVOLVE. IT IS THE IMPACT OF THE ENVIRONMENT ON THESE FACTORS THAT IS THE FOCUS OF THIS PROPOSAL. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT ON THE FUNCTIONAL POTENTIAL OF RNA. THE FUNCTIONS EXHIBITED BY RNA IN MODERN BIOLOGY AND THOSE DISCOVERED INDEPENDENT OF BIOLOGY THROUGH IN VITRO EVOLUTION HAVE BEEN USED TO DEVELOPED AND CONSTRAIN THEORIES ABOUT THE ROLE OF RNA IN THE EMERGENCE OF LIFE. THE RANGE OF CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH IN VITRO EVOLUTION HAS BEEN USED TO PROBE RANDOM SEQUENCE SPACE FOR FUNCTIONAL RNAS IS FAR NARROWER THAN THE RANGE OF CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH RNA IS PROPOSED TO HAVE FUNCTIONED IN THE VERY EARLIEST FORMS OF LIFE, OR UNDER WHICH IT IS KNOWN TO BE FUNCTIONAL IN EXTANT BIOLOGY. THIS PROPOSAL WILL DRAMATICALLY EXPAND THE RANGE OF CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH RANDOM SEQUENCE SPACE HAS BEEN PROBED FOR FUNCTION. THIS WILL PROVIDE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FUNCTIONAL POTENTIAL OF THIS EARLY BIOPOLYMER, AND THEREBY PROVIDE A MORE SOLID EXPERIMENTAL BASIS FOR THEORIES OF ANCIENT LIFE."

VARIATIONS IN STELLAR INSOLATION DUE TO THE TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF THESE ORBITAL QUANTITIES CAN ESTABLISH PERIODIC CYCLES BETWEEN ICE FREE, ICE CAP, AND ICE COVERED STATES IN A PLANETS CLIMATE HISTORY. EVIDENCE OF THIS MILANKOVITCH ORBITAL FORCING ON EARTH IS SHOWN IN ICE CORES AND DEEP SEA OXYGEN ISOTOPIC RECORDS AS LONG TERM CYCLES IN THE EXTENT OF GLOBAL ICE COVERAGE. THE 41,000 AND 23,000 YEAR CYCLES IN CLIMATE DIRECTLY CORRESPOND TO CHANGES IN INSOLATION DUE TO VARIATIONS IN OBLIQUITY AND ORBITAL PRECESSION HOWEVER, THE 100,000 YEAR CYCLE THAT CORRESPONDS TO ORBITAL ECCENTRICITY VARIATION ONLY WEAKLY AFFECTS SOLAR INSOLATION, AND NOT BY ENOUGH TO DRIVE A STRONG CLIMATE CYCLE. AN EXPLANATION FOR THIS DISCREPANCY IS THAT INTERNAL CLIMATE MECHANISMS AMPLIFY THESE SMALL CHANGES IN INSOLATION TO YIELD A MUCH STRONGER SIGNAL, WHICH IS A CONCEPT KNOWN AS A CLIMATIC RESONANCE. THIS ABILITY OF A TERRESTRIAL PLANET TO RESONATE WITH CHANGES IN INSOLATION DUE TO ORBITAL VARIATIONS CAN BE USED TO ESTABLISH AN IMPROVED HZ ESTIMATE BASED UPON THE PARTICULAR ORBITAL PARAMETERS OF A PLANET AND THE COMPOSITION OF ITS CLIMATE. EXTRASOLAR TERRESTRIAL PLANETS DISCOVERED THROUGH GROUND BASED SURVEYS, THE KEPLER MISSION, AND FUTURE MISSIONS SUCH AS JWST AND TESS PROVIDE PRIMARY CANDIDATES FOR ANALYSIS OF THEIR ORBITAL HZ, WHICH WILL CHARACTERIZE THE HABITABILITY HISTORY OF A SYSTEM BASED UPON OBSERVABLE QUANTITIES.  THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL IMPROVE ESTIMATES OF THE ORBITAL HZ OF INDIVIDUAL PLANETARY SYSTEMS USING A STOCHASTIC LATITUDINAL ENERGY BALANCE MODEL SEBM. THIS SEBM HAS BEEN EMPLOYED IN PREVIOUS STUDIES OF TERRESTRIAL CLIMATE AND CAN BE RUN IN A DETERMINISTIC OR STOCHASTIC MODE TO SIMULATE BOTH STEADY STATE CLIMATE CONFIGURATIONS AS WELL AS TIME DEPENDENT CLIMATE RESONANCES BASED UPON ORBITAL VARIATIONS. THE SEBM HAS BEEN CONFIGURED WITH A STATE OF THE ART RADIATIVE TRANSFER PARAMETERIZATION BASED UPON RECENT DERIVATIONS OF ABSORPTION COEFFICIENTS FROM THE HITRAN 2012 DATABASE, WHICH ALLOWS FULL EXPLORATION OF A PARAMETER SPACE OF N2 H2O CO2 ATMOSPHERES FOR SURFACE PRESSURES RANGING FROM 0.5 TO 5 BAR. THE REQUIRED WORK WILL INVOLVE CONFIGURING THE SEBM WITH OBSERVED OR ESTIMATED ORBITAL PARAMETERS FOR PARTICULAR EXTRASOLAR PLANETS TO CALCULATE THE TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF THE ORBITAL HZ LIMITS AS A FUNCTION OF ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION.  THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH IS RELEVANT TO NASAS HABITABLE WORLDS PROGRAM AS A THEORETICAL STUDY OF THE CLIMATES OF EXTRASOLAR TERRESTRIAL PLANETS AND THEIR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN THE PRESENCE OF WATER. THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH WILL HELP TO IDENTIFY THE CHARACTERISTICS AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF POTENTIALLY HABITABLE ENVIRONMENTS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND BEYOND  C.41  BY APPLYING KNOWLEDGE OF CLIMATE RESONANCE ON EARTH TO BETTER CONSTRAIN ORBITAL HZ ESTIMATES FOR EXTRASOLAR PLANETS. THE SCOPE OF THIS RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE HABITABILITY OF EXTRASOLAR PLANETS, SO THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT RELEVANT TO THE EMERGING WORLDS PROGRAM, THE EXOBIOLOGY PROGRAM, OR ANY EXISTING DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAMS."

THE BLUECOM TEAM PROPOSES TO DESIGN AND DEVELOP WACRS DURING THE PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT BY INTEGRATING A REAL-TIME RECONFIGURABLE RADIO FRONT-END AND A FIELD PROGRAMMABLE GATE ARRAY IMPLEMENTED COGNITIVE ENGINE ON TO A SOFTWARE-DEFINED RADIO (SDR) PLATFORM.   WACRS WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO SENSE STATE OF THE RF SPECTRUM AND NETWORK AND SELF-OPTIMIZE ITS PERFORMANCE IN RESPONSE TO THE SENSED STATE. THE COGNITIVE ENGINE IS MADE OF MACHINE-LEARNING AIDED ALGORITHMS TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. THE SDR PLATFORM COUPLED WITH A REAL-TIME RECONFIGURABLE RF FRONT-END WILL ALLOW THE WACR TO RECONFIGURE ITS COMMUNICATION MODE AS DIRECTED BY THE COGNITIVE ENGINE. THIS WILL ENABLE A WACR TO OVERCOME COMMUNICATIONS CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED IN SPACE APPLICATIONS INCLUDING INTERFERENCE, DEEP FADING, WAVEFORM AGILITY, DELAY AND VERY LOW SNR BY DYNAMICALLY CHANGING ITS MODE OF OPERATION. THIS TYPE OF SELF-AWARE, AUTONOMOUS AND INTELLIGENT COMMUNICATION IS WHAT WILL BE REQUIRED TO EXPLOIT THE FULL BENEFITS OF NETWORKED CLUSTERS OF SATELLITES (E.G. CUBESATS) IN VARIOUS MISSION TYPES INCLUDING EARTH MONITORING AND UNMANNED AUTONOMOUS LUNAR/ PLANETARY EXPLORATION.

A RICH TROVE OF DATA FROM NASA GRB MISSIONS AND GROUND-BASED FOLLOW UP OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN COLLECTED. CAREFUL DATA MINING WITH WELL-DEFINED SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES HOLDS THE KEY TO ADDRESS OPEN QUESTIONS IN GRB PHYSICS, SUCH AS JET COMPOSITION, RADIATION MECHANISM, PROGENITOR AND CENTRAL ENGINE PHYSICS. WE PROPOSE TO PERFORM DATA ANALYSES IN THE FOLLOWING THREE DIRECTIONS. 1. THE TIME RESOLVED GRB SPECTRA HAVE A DOMINANT COMPONENT THAT CAN BE FIT WITH A PHENOMENOLOGICAL ``BAND'''' FUNCTION. THE PHYSICAL MEANING OF THIS FUNCTION REMAINS UNCLEAR. RECENTLY WE MADE A BREAKTHROUGH IN THEORETICAL MODELING, AND SHOWED THAT FAST-COOLING SYNCHROTRON RADIATION OF ELECTRONS IN A DECREASING MAGNETIC FIELD CAN MIMIC THE BAND FUNCTION IN DETECTOR''S BANDPASS, BUT DIFFERS FROM BAND FUNCTION SLIGHTLY. WE PROPOSE TO APPLY THIS HYSICALLYMOTIVATED MODEL TO SYSTEMATICALLY FIT THE GRB PROMPT EMISSION DATA COLLECTED BY FERMI GBM AND LAT, AND TEST WHETHER THE DOMINANT GRB EMISSION MECHANISM IS FAST COOLING SYNCHROTRON RADIATION. WE WILL ALSO FIT TIME-DEPENDENT SPECTRA WITH A TIME-DEPENDENT MODEL TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER A QUASI-THERMAL \PHOTOSPHERE'''' EMISSION COMPONENT IS INDEED NEEDED TO FIT THE OBSERVED SPECTRA. THIS WOULD SHED LIGHT ONTO THE UNKNOWN COMPOSITION OF GRB JETS. BY FITTING THE TIME RESOLVED SPECTRA, WE WILL ALSO CONSTRAIN IMPORTANT PHYSICAL PARAMETERS OF GRB PROMPT EMISSION, SUCH AS THE EMISSION SITE OF GRBS, THE STRENGTH OF MAGNETIC FIELDS, AS WELL AS THEIR EVOLUTION WITH RADIUS. 2. RECENT GRB MULTI-WAVELENGTH OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT IT IS NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD TO DEFINE THE PHYSICAL CATEGORY OF A GRB BASED ON THE TRADITIONAL CLASSIFICATION IN THE \""DURATION''''-\""HARDNESS'''' DOMAIN. SOME LONG-DURATION GRBS MAY NOT HAVE A MASSIVE STAR ORIGIN, WHILE SOME SHORT-DURATION GRBS MAY INSTEAD HAVE A MASSIVE STAR ORIGIN. WE PROPOSE TO SYSTEMATICALLY STUDY THE GAMMA-RAY SWIFT/BAT, FERMI/GBM-LAT), X-RAY (SWIFT/XRT, CHANDRA), AND OPTICAL (GROUND-BASED AND HST) PROPERTIES OF ALL SHORT GRBS, AND APPLY MULTI-WAVELENGTH OBSERVATIONAL CRITERIA TO CONSTRAIN THE POSSIBLE PROGENITOR(S) OF THEM. 3. THE GRB CENTRAL ENGINE IS STILL NOT IDENTIFIED. GROWING OBSERVATIONAL DATA AND THEORETICAL MODELING SUGGEST THAT AT LEAST SOME GRBS MAY HOST A MAGNETAR (IN CONTRAST TO A HYPER-ACCRETING BLACK HOLE) CENTRAL ENGINE. WE PROPOSE TO CARRY OUT A STATISTICAL STUDY OF THE PROMPT EMISSION AND AFTERGLOW PROPERTIES OF GRBS THAT SHOW POSSIBLE EVIDENCE OF MAGNETAR BEHAVIOR AND COMPARE THEIR PROPERTIES WITH THOSE THAT DO NOT SHOW SUCH EVIDENCE. WE WILL DEFINE THREE SAMPLES: A GOLD SAMPLE THAT SHOW A STEADY X-RAY EMISSION FOLLOWED BY A RAPID DECLINE, WHICH ARE LIKELY POWERED BY INTERNAL DISSIPATION OF A MAGNETAR WIND, A SILVER SAMPLE SHOWING A SHALLOW DECAY SEGMENT FOLLOWED BY A NORMAL DECAY, WHICH CAN BE INTERPRETED AS EXTERNAL SHOCK EMISSION WITH A MAGNETAR CONTINUOUS ENERGY INJECTION INTO THE BLASTWAVE, AND A SAMPLE THAT INCLUDES OTHER GRBS THAT DO NOT SHOW ANY EVIDENCE OF MAGNETAR. WE WILL COMPARE VARIOUS OBSERVATIONAL PROPERTIES (E.G. ISOTROPIC ENERGY/LUMINOSITY, JET-CORRECTED ENERGY/LUMINOSITY, JET OPENING ANGLE, PEAK ENERGY) OF THESE SAMPLES AND INVESTIGATE WHETHER THERE ARE NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCES AMONG THESE SAMPLES.

VOLATILE ELEMENTAL ABUNDANCES IN PHOSPHATE MINERALS WITHIN MARTIAN METEORITES ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS RECORDERS OF MAGMATIC CONDITIONS ON MARS, AND CAN SHED LIGHT ON THE EVOLUTION OF WATER CONTENT WITHIN MARTIAN MAGMAS. THE ANHYDROUS NATURE OF MERRILLITE HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN INTERPRETED AS EVIDENCE OF WATER-LIMITED LATE-STAGE MARTIAN MELTS. HOWEVER, RECENT RESEARCH, BASED ON HIGH OH ABUNDANCES IN APATITE, SUGGESTS HIGH H2O CONCENTRATIONS (1.53.0 WT.%) IN THE RESIDUAL MELTS THAT FORMED THE PARENT ROCK OF THE SHERGOTTY MARTIAN METEORITE, DESPITE THE PRESENCE OF MERRILLITE IN THAT METEORITE. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION AS TO WHY ANHYDROUS MERRILLITE WOULD FORM RATHER THAN WHITLOCKITE IN MELTS THAT WOULD HAVE HAD AVAILABLE H2O AT THE TIME OF PHOSPHATE CRYSTALLIZATION. ONE POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THE PRESENCE OF MERRILLITE IN MARTIAN METEORITES IS THAT THE SHOCK THAT ALL MARTIAN METEORITES HAVE EXPERIENCED HAS DEVOLATILIZED (I.E. DEHYDROGENATED) WHAT WAS WHITLOCKITE TO FORM MERRILLITE. DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF MERRILLITE TO UNDERSTANDING MAGMATIC CONDITIONS ON MARS, TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, NO EXPERIMENTS HAVE EXAMINED SHOCK OF WHITLOCKITE TO DETERMINE WHETHER WHITLOCKITE TO MERRILLITE SHOCK FORMATION CAN OCCUR. THEREFORE, WE PROPOSE TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT MERRILLITE PRESENT IN MARTIAN METEORITES MAY RESULT FROM SHOCK INDUCED DEHYDROGENATION AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF WHITLOCKITE TO MERRILLITE. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW SHOCK AFFECTS INDICATOR MINERALS SUCH AS MERRILLITE WILL GREATLY IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF MARTIAN GEOLOGIC PROCESS, FROM THE MANTLE TO THE SURFACE. IN ORDER TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING TASKS: 1). SYNTHESIZE WHITLOCKITE AND MERRILLITE WITH CATION CHEMISTRY SIMILAR TO THAT SEEN IN MARTIAN METEORITE SAMPLES. 2). PERFORM SHOCK EXPERIMENTS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF SHOCK PRESSURES, ANALOGOUS TO THOSE GENERALLY OBSERVED IN MARTIAN METEORITES, ON THE MINERALOGY OF WHITLOCKITE. 3).

IN THIS PROPOSED GRANT, WE WILL SPOTLIGHT THREE HYPOTHESES THROUGH WHICH BIOMASS BURNING AND LAND SURFACE CHANGE MAY AFFECT PRECIPITATION DURING THE TRADITIONAL BURNING SEASON USING THE NUMBER OF PRECIPITATION FREE DAYS AS A METRIC: 1) BOTH LAND SURFACE CHANGE AND BIOMASS BURNING EQUALLY REDUCE THE FREQUENCY OF LIGHT PRECIPITATION FROM SMALL WARM CONVECTION LEADING TO THE OBSERVED INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ZERO RAIN DAYS AT SURFACE STATIONS. 2) DETRAINMENT OF SMOKE PARTICLES AT MID-TROPOSPHERIC LEVELS IN DEEP CONVECTION WILL INHIBIT PRECIPITATION IN TROPICAL MID-LEVEL STRATIFORM CLOUDS, FURTHER INCREASING THE NUMBER OF ZERO RAIN DAYS.  3) THE PRESENCE OF SMOKE LEADS TO MORE ISOLATED BUT MORE INVIGORATED THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE NW COAST OF SARAWAK, BORNEO. THE NULL HYPOTHESIS FOR THESE IS THAT BULK METEOROLOGY ALONE, WITHOUT ANY AEROSOL OR LAND SURFACE EFFECTS, CAN EXPLAIN THE NATURE OF ZERO RAIN DAYS IN OUR AREA OF INTEREST. USING THE ABOVE HYPOTHESES AS FOCAL POINTS, WE WILL EMPLOY A COMPREHENSIVE OBSERVATION AND MODELING FRAMEWORK. FIRST, BOTH IN SITU AND SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS OF AEROSOL PARTICLES, CLOUDS, AND PRECIPITATION WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP A BASELINE CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF CONVECTION CHARACTERISTICS IN OUR TARGET AREAS IN THE CONTEXT OF BIOMASS BURNING METEOROLOGY. SECOND, THE MODEL SENSITIVITIES OF BOTH SHALLOW AND DEEP CONVECTION TO LAND COVER CHANGE AND BIOMASS BURNING WILL BE EXPLORED USING MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO METHODOLOGY, AND A SEPARATE LES STUDY FOR SEVERAL IDEALIZED CASES OF SHALLOW CONVECTION. THIRD, BASED ON THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, DETERMINISTIC WRF RUNS WILL BE CONFIGURED TO HELP UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF LAND COVER CHANGE AND BIOMASS BURNING SMOKE IN EL NINO AND NEUTRAL CASES. FINALLY, BASED ON THE PREVIOUS THREE COMPONENTS, OUR HYPOTHESES WILL BE EVALUATED AND AN ASSESSMENT WILL BE MADE AS TO OBSERVATIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO MONITOR REGIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE."

(1) PM2.5 AIR QUALITY APPLICATIONS. WE WILL (A) EVALUATE AND IMPROVE THE APPLICATION OF THE (MODIS-TYPE IF POSSIBLE) VIIRS AEROSOL PRODUCT FOR THE OPERATIONAL MONITORING OF PM2.5 AIR QUALITY IN REMOTE SENSING INFORMATION GATEWAY (RSIG) AT THE U.S.ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA), (B) SUBSEQUENTLY TRANSFER RSIGS PM2.5 ESTIMATES TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH TRACKING NETWORK (EPHTN) AT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC), AND (C) EVALUATE AND IMPROVE VIIRS-RSIG PM2.5 ESTIMATES FOR ENHANCED SPATIAL PREDICTIONS IN ON-GOING EPA-CDC EPHTN EFFORTS, CURRENTLY USING CMAQ MODEL OUTPUT AND FILTER-BASED PM2.5 OBSERVATIONS FROM EPA-AQS. THE PM2.5 DERIVATION WILL BUILD UPON THE TEAMS EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA AND ASSOCIATED PUBLISHED METHODS BY EXTENDING THE USE OF AEROSOL VERTICAL PROFILES FROM CHEMISTRY TRANSPORT MODELS FROM GEOS-CHEM TO REGIONAL MODELS, WRF-CHEM AND WRF-CMAQ.

DUST EMISSIONS CANNOT BE ESTIMATED WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OF WIND SPEED AND SOIL CHARACTERISTICS; HENCE, THEIR LONG-TERM SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO CHANGES IN REGIONAL AND GLOBAL CLIMATE.  SINCE DUST PARTICLES HAVE IMPORTANT RADIATIVE EFFECTS ON CLIMATE, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE CLIMATE OF SPECTRAL REFLECTANCES IN SHORTWAVE AND OUTGOING RADIATION AT THERMAL INFRARED SPECTRA CONTAIN CRITICAL SIGNALS FOR RECOVERING CHANGES IN DUST EMISSIONS AND, CONVERSELY, FOR DIAGNOSING HOW DUST EMISSIONS MANIFEST CHANGE IN LARGE-SCALE GENERAL CIRCULATION. TO EVALUATE THIS HYPOTHESIS, OUR METHODS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING STEPS: (1) GENERATE SYNTHETIC SPECTRAL CLIMATE DATA IN THE SHORTWAVE AND THERMAL IR SPECTRA BY INTEGRATING THE GEOS-CHEM MODEL WITH THE UNIFIED LINEARIZED VECTOR RADIATIVE TRANSFER MODEL (UNL-VRTM). (2) COMPARE AND ANALYZE DUST EMISSION INFORMATION CONTENT WITHIN SYNTHETIC DATA AND DATA FROM GOME, SCIAMACHY, AIRS, AND IASI. (3) USE DECADAL DATA FROM GOME, SCIAMACHY, AIRS, AND IASI TO RECOVER DUST EMISSIONS THROUGH ADJOINT-BASED INVERSE MODELING.

ADDRESSING THESE QUESTIONS IS ENABLED BY UNIQUE INTEGRATION OF THE CAPABILITIES OF THE UNLVRTM RADIATIVE TRANSFER MODEL WITH THE GEO-CHEM ADJOINT AND WRF-CHEM CHEMICAL TRANSPORT MODELS. AT HYPERSPECTRAL RESOLUTIONS, THE UNL-VRTM CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY COMPUTE THE STOKES 4-VECTOR ELEMENTS AND THEIR SENSITIVITIES (JACOBIANS) WITH RESPECT TO AEROSOL SINGLE SCATTERING PARAMETERS (SUCH AS AEROSOL MASS AND SIZE) IN EACH ATMOSPHERIC LAYER.

THE FORESTS AND THEIR BIOTA HAVE EVOLVED TOGETHER WITH THE PHYSICAL LANDSCAPE, CLOSELY LINKING PROCESSES IN THE EARTH''S INTERIOR WITH SURFACE LANDSCAPES, CLIMATE, HYDROLOGY, ECOSYSTEMS, AND, ULTIMATELY, BIOTIC DIVERSITY. WE PROPOSE A SET OF WORKSHOPS TO EXAMINE THE INTERCONNECTED RELATIONSHIPS THAT GOVERN ALL ASPECTS OF GEOPHYSICAL DIVERSITY AND PLANT DIVERSITY ACROSS THE DYNAMIC SPATIAL GRADIENTS THAT CHARACTERIZE THE EASTWARD TRANSITION FROM THE HIGH ELEVATION ANDES OF PERU INTO THE LOWLAND AMAZON AND THE WESTWARD TRANSITION FROM THE ANDES OF ECUADOR AND COLOMBIA THROUGH THE CHOCO FOREST TO THE PACIFIC COAST. WE WILL UNDERTAKE GEOPHYSICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THESE REGIONS AT FINE (METER) SPATIAL SCALES AND AT A RANGE OF TEMPORAL SCALES, FROM HOURS TO MILLIONS OF YEARS. OUR INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM WILL INCLUDE BIOLOGISTS, GEOLOGISTS, LEADERS IN TROPICAL REMOTE SENSING, CLIMATE DYNAMICISTS, AND MODELERS, WITH EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE REGION AND WITH ACCESS TO EXISTING DATA SETS. TOGETHER THIS TEAM WILL EXAMINE HOW PATTERNS OF BIOTIC DIVERSITY OF TROPICAL ECOSYSTEMS, FROM THE HIGH ANDES TO THE EASTERN AND WESTERN LOWLANDS OF PERU, ECUADOR, AND COLOMBIA ARE RELATED TO, AND CONTROLLED BY, BOTH (1) CONTEMPORARY GRADIENTS IN CLIMATE, SOILS, AND LANDFORMS; AND (2) PROCESSES ON EVOLUTIONARY TIMESCALES, INCLUDING TECTONISM, GEOMORPHOLOGY, CLIMATE, AND PHYLOGENETIC HISTORY. OUR PROXIMATE GOAL IS TO ESTABLISH A LINK BETWEEN DISPARATE FIELDS WORKING ON FACTORS CONTROLLING BIODIVERSITY AND ITS ASSESSMENT USING HIGH RESOLUTION ACTIVE AND PASSIVE REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES, WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF ASSEMBLING A MECHANISTIC MODEL OF THE PROCESSES THAT COUPLE GEODIVERSITY AND BIODIVERSITY IN BOTH A SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL CONTEXT FOR THESE TWO GLOBALLY UNSURPASSED CENTERS OF BIODIVERSITY. THIS MODEL WILL ENABLE US TO UNDERSTAND AND EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF CREATING PROTECTED AREAS TO PRESERVE PLANT AND ANIMAL BIODIVERSITY ON THE BASIS OF GEOPHYSICAL DIVERSITY, AS WELL AS ADVANCE THE ABILITY TO ASSESS GEOLOGY AND BIODIVERSITY IN TROPICAL SYSTEMS USING ADVANCED REMOTE SENSING METHODS. OUR WORKSHOPS WILL BRING TOGETHER SEVERAL ACTIVE RESEARCH GROUPS WITH EXTENSIVE RESEARCH EXPERIENCE IN TROPICAL SOUTH AMERICA THAT HAVE NOT COLLABORATED PREVIOUSLY AND THAT ARE MAKING USE OF RECENT ANALYTICAL, TECHNOLOGICAL, AND CONCEPTUAL INNOVATIONS TO ADVANCE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL PATTERNS AND HISTORY IN THE NEOTROPICS. OUR EFFORTS WILL CAPITALIZE ON AN EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF TREE INVENTORY PLOTS ALONG THE ELEVATION GRADIENT FROM THE HIGHLANDS TO EASTERN LOWLANDS IN PERU, ECUADOR, AND COLOMBIA THAT ENABLE US TO MAP THE CONTEMPORARY ABUNDANCE, DISTRIBUTION, DIVERSITY, AND EARLY RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE OF FOREST TREES, AND TO PLAN FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF A SIMILAR ALTITUDINAL NETWORK OF TREE PLOTS IN THE CHOCO FOREST. OUR SPATIAL DOMAINS FOCUS ON THREE REGIONS WITH EXCEPTIONAL BIODIVERSITY AND ENDEMISM: (1) PERU, WHICH ALREADY HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED WITH BOTH ACTIVE AND PASSIVE REMOTE SENSING DATA OF FOREST STRUCTURE AND BIODIVERSITY AND WITH STUDIES OF GEOLOGY, GEOMORPHOLOGY, AND CLIMATE; (2) ECUADOR, WHICH HAS BEEN LITTLE STUDIED FOR ANY OF THESE PARAMETERS; AND (3) COLOMBIA, WITH THE LARGEST AREA OF REMAINING CHOCO FOREST ALONG THE PACIFIC COASTS. THIS NETWORK OF SITES ALSO ALLOWS A STUDY OF LATITUDINAL GRADIENTS OF DIVERSITY FROM THE SOUTHERN PERUVIAN ANDES TO NORTHERN COLOMBIA.

TO EXPAND THE IMPACT OF THE PROGRAM, AND THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS REACHED, SIPI WILL PARTNER WITH THREE REGIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH PREDOMINANTLY NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENT POPULATION. UTILIZING SIPI S EXPERIENCE IN PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT THE TRIBAL COLLEGES (TCU S), MEMBERS OF THE TCU ENGINEERING PROGRAMS WORKING GROUP, WILL DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT SIMILAR PROGRAMS FROM THEIR CAMPUS TO REACH OUT TO UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THE ROBOTIC ELEMENTS OF THIS PROGRAM WILL FOCUS HEAVILY ON PERFORMING REMOTE SCIENCE OPERATIONS, AKIN TO THE MARS EXPLORATION ROVERS, TO PROVIDE AN INTERESTING AND TECHNICALLY RICH IT ENVIRONMENT FOR STUDENTS TO LEARN. STUDENTS WILL GET HANDS ON EXPERIENCE IN OPERATING ROBOTS FROM REMOTE LOCATIONS TO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF COMPUTERS FOR COMPUTATION AND CONTROL, AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS TO TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE INFORMATION. ADDITIONALLY STUDENTS WILL WORK DIRECTLY WITH ROBOTS TO PROGRAM THEM AND CONFIGURE THEM WITH VARIOUS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PAYLOADS. THE CONCEPTS OF SYSTEM INTEGRATION WILL BE LEARNED THROUGH THESE EXPERIENCES TO CREATE A BIG-PICTURE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW IT INFRASTRUCTURE IMPACTS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. THE INTELLECTUAL MERIT OF THIS PROGRAM LIES IN ITS APPLICATION OF A GLOBALLY RECOGNIZED HIGH TECHNOLOGY ACCOMPLISHMENT, THE EXPLORATION OF MARS WITH ROBOTS, AND BRINGING THOSE SAME CONCEPTS TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS SO THEY CAN EXPERIENCE FIRSTHAND MANY OF THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT MAKE THESE MISSIONS POSSIBLE. WITHOUT AN ENGAGING CONTEXT TO LEARN IT AND STEM DISCIPLINES, STUDENTS CAN EASILY BE ATTRACTED TO OTHER PROSPECTS AND MAY FIND LITTLE MOTIVATION FOR ENGAGING IN THE HARD WORK OF STUDYING STEM AND IT AT HIGHER LEVELS. FEW IF ANY PROFESSIONALS WORKING IN THE STEM INDUSTRY CHOSE THEIR FIELD BECAUSE IT WAS DIFFICULT. THEY LIKELY CHOSE IT BECAUSE AT SOME POINT THE POSSIBILITY OF CREATING SOMETHING BIGGER THAN THEMSELVES SEEMED POSSIBLE. ONE BROADER IMPACT OF THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF STUDENTS BEING EXPOSED TO THE APPLICATIONS OF IT AND STEM. BY BRINGING CONCEPTS AND TECHNOLOGY THAT ARE COMMONLY VIEWED AS BEING PERFORMED ELSEWHERE BY OTHER PEOPLE DIRECTLY INTO THESE STUDENTS  LIVES THEY WILL REACH NEW LEVELS OF UNDERSTANDING OF IT UNLIKELY TO BE OBTAINED OTHERWISE. THE GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM IS THAT THESE STUDENTS MAY ONE DAY ALSO BE ABLE TO REALIZE DREAMS BY USING TECHNOLOGY TO ACCOMPLISH THINGS WHICH TODAY HAVE YET TO BE IMAGINED."

THESE ARE BEING EXPLORED FOR POTENTIAL USE ON FUTURE NEAR-EARTH COMMUNICATIONS RELAY SATELLITES IN GEOSYNCHRONOUS EARTH ORBIT (GEO).  OPTIONS OF INTEREST IN THIS STUDY ARE ADVANCED ALTERNATIVES TO SERVICE PROVISION TECHNIQUES USED ON THE CURRENT TRACKING AND DATA RELAY SATELLITES (TDRS). THOSE ARE S-BAND MULTIPLE ACCESS (SMA) VIA PHASED ARRAY WITH GROUND-BASED BEAM-FORMING, AND S-BAND&KA-BAND SINGLE ACCESS (SSA&KASA) VIA BY MECHANICALLY STEERED PARABOLIC DISHES.  KU-BAND SINGLE ACCESS SERVICE IS EXPECTED TO END WITH THE CURRENT FLEET OF TDRSS.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL OF ELECTRONICALLY STEERED OR SWITCHED MULTIPLE BEAM ANTENNA SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE ADVANCED MULTIPLE ACCESS SERVICES IN KA-BAND.MB/MA ANTENNAS UNDER CONSIDERATION IN THIS STUDY ARE: (1) DIRECT PHASED ARRAYS (POSSIBLY SEPARATE TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE ARRAYS) PROVIDING MULTIPLE SIMULTANEOUS ELECTRONICALLY-STEERED BEAMS; (2) PHASED ARRAY-FED REFLECTORS THAT USE A REFLECTOR TO INCREASE THE ARRAY''S GAIN WHILE MAINTAINING THE REQUIRED FIELD OF REGARD (FOR) (NOTE THAT THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM A CONFOCAL-FED PHASED ARRAY CONCEPT); AND (3) AND MULTIPLE SIMULTANEOUS SPOT BEAMS WHERE SPOT BEAMS ARE ELECTRONICALLY SWITCHED TO TRACK USER MISSIONS AND THE USER MISSION HAND-OFFS ARE HANDLED ONBOARD THE RELAY.  IN ALL THREE CASES, BEAM-FORMING, BEAM STEERING OR SWITCHING, AND CONTROLLING IS PERFORMED ONBOARD THE RELAY SATELLITE.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT HAND-OFFS OF USER MISSIONS BETWEEN SPOT BEAMS AND THE NEED FOR DIRECTIONAL BEAMS ON USER MISSION SPACECRAFT HAVE BEEN ASSUMED TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL, UNWANTED USER BURDEN BY SOME IN THE SCAN PROGRAM.  THE KA-BAND SPACE-TO-SPACE SPECTRUM ALLOCATION FOR SCIENCE USE HAS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT BANDWIDTH (1.5 GHZ) TO ACCOMMODATE ANY PROJECTED AGGREGATE NASA MISSION USE.  CANDIDATE MB/MA TECHNIQUES IDENTIFIED BY THE OFFEROR SHOULD CONSIDER PARTITIONING OR CHANNELIZING THE AVAILABLE SPECTRUM INTO A LOW-DATA RATE MULTI-USER SERVICE SIMILAR TO THE CURRENT SMA SPREAD SPECTRUM FUNCTIONALITY, AND A FLEXIBLE SPECTRUM CHANNELIZATION AND MULTIPLE ACCESS TECHNIQUE FOR HIGHER DATA RATE USERS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY SERVE MULTIPLE HIGH DATA-RATE USERS AT ONCE DEPENDING ON DATA NEEDS.A KEY CONCERN FOR THIS STUDY IS BALANCING BETWEEN THE COMMUNICATIONS LINK BURDEN BETWEEN THE RELAY SATELLITE AND THE USER MISSIONS.  MANY OF THE CURRENT TDRS USERS ACCESS THE SSA SERVICE VIA OMNI-DIRECTIONAL ANTENNAS TO PROVIDE LOW DATA-RATE (1-8 KBPS) TRACKING, TELEMETRY AND CONTROL (TT&C) FUNCTIONALITY.  FUTURE USERS WITH SIMILAR NEEDS WOULD REQUIRE A HIGHER RELAY G/T THAN TDRS SMA FOR THE FUTURE RELAY MB/MA PAYLOAD TO PROVIDE THESE SAME SERVICES VIA A KA-BAND OMNI ANTENNA ON THE USER MISSION SPACECRAFT. OR, THE USER WOULD NEED TO INCORPORATE A HIGHER GAIN, STEERABLE ANTENNA OF SOME FORM. ALTERNATIVES FOR KA-BAND USER MISSION ANTENNAS IS THE TOPIC OF A SEPARATE RTAPS2 TASK ORDER STUDY CONTRACT.FINALLY, THE 2ND AND 3RD GENERATION TDRS KASA SYSTEMS HAVE A RELATIVELY HIGH KA-BAND G/T, AND HAVE SET EXPECTATIONS FOR FUTURE RELAY SYSTEMS.  ACHIEVING THE DESIRED G/T MAY BE PROHIBITIVELY DIFFICULT FOR SOME OF THE FUTURE CANDIDATE SOLUTIONS. THEREFORE THIS STUDY SHOULD ALSO INVESTIGATE LOWER PERFORMANCE MB/MA SOLUTIONS AS OPTIONS.  LOWER RECEIVER G/T ON THE RELAY WITH INCREASED USER BURDEN FOR EIRP IS ONE POSSIBILITY."

One of the proposals, Dynamic Flight Envelope Assessment and Prediction"" (proposal number 07-IRAC-07-0034) submitted by The Boeing Company (DBA Boeing), was selected to support the Aviation Safety Program, and in particular the Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control (IRAC) Project.  The primary goal of the Dynamic Flight Envelope Assessment and Prediction program is to provide NASA with flight safety enhancement through a process to identify fault damage anomalies in air-vehicle structure, predict an allowable flight maneuver loads envelope for the damaged vehicle, and measure changes in structure dynamics mode shapes due to the damage. The system will also provide adaptive control to maintain the aircraft within the structure limits and suppress any adverse structure dynamic mode interaction with the flight control system. The program's primary focus is on Control-Centric Modeling, combining rigid body models with dynamic flexible structure and loads models to provide the basis for on-line adaptive control of the structure properties of the aircraft. Program products will be algorithms and processes that can provide control of structures properties for tactical and transport aircraft. This program addresses system anomalies caused by battle damage to military aircraft and structure failures to civil aircraft caused by incidents such as fatigue, corrosion, mid-air collisions, or improper procedures. The program builds on the NASA Intelligent Flight Control System technology, already demonstrated on a research F-15 for adaptive control of the aerodynamic capability of a damaged aircraft. The significance of this program is to add a capability by using adaptive control to prevent excessive structure loads or dynamic interaction, thereby increasing the safety and survivability of air and space vehicles. The program will assist NASA on meeting the objectives of the NASA Aviation Safety Program. This program addresses IRAC Topic 1.3, Dynamic Flight Envelope Assessment and Prediction.   This acquisition will result in a three year Cost-plus-Fixed-Fee contract to be conducted by The Boeing Company, Phantom Works division, St. Louis, MO for a total amount of $1,127,367.  """

COMPOSITES ARE MATERIALS THAT ARE COMBINATIONS OF TWO OR MORE ORGANIC OR INORGANIC COMPONENTS. ONE MATERIAL SERVES AS A \MATRIX,\"" WHICH IS THE MATERIAL THAT HOLDS EVERYTHING TOGETHER, WHILE THE OTHER MATERIAL SERVES AS REINFORCEMENT, IN THE FORM OF FIBERS EMBEDDED IN THE MATRIX.  A CRYOTANK IS A CONTAINER THAT CAN STORE VERY COLD LIQUIDS, IN THIS CASE LIQUID HYDROGEN.  THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO PROVIDE NEW AND INNOVATIVE CRYOTANK TECHNOLOGIES THAT ENABLE HUMAN SPACE EXPLORATION TO DESTINATIONS BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT SUCH AS THE MOON, NEAR-EARTH ASTEROIDS, AND MARS.  THE FOCUS OF THIS INITIAL 1-YEAR EFFORT IS TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOP THE COMPOSITE CRYOTANK TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRED FOR A HEAVY LIFT LAUNCH VEHICLE (SIMILAR TO THE SATURN V ROCKET USED TO LAUNCH APOLLO MISSIONS) BETWEEN 8.4 METERS AND 10.0 METERS IN DIAMETER.  THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL SERVE MULTIPLE CUSTOMERS INCLUDING NASA, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD), AND COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE COMPANIES.  FUTURE SPIN-OFF CAPABILITIES MAY INCLUDE LH2 CORE STAGES (1ST AND TYPICALLY LARGEST SECTION OF A ROCKET), IN-SPACE PROPULSION SYSTEMS (A PROPULSION SYSTEM IS A MACHINE THAT PRODUCES THRUST TO PUSH AN OBJECT FORWARD), ON-ORBIT PROPELLANT DEPOTS (A CACHE OF PROPELLANT THAT IS PLACED ON AN ORBIT ABOUT THE EARTH OR ANOTHER BODY TO ALLOW SPACECRAFT TO BE FUELLED IN SPACE), AND LIQUID OXYGEN (LOX) CRYOTANKS.    OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS, THERE HAVE BEEN A VARIETY OF COMPOSITE CRYOGENIC TANK PROGRAMS AT NASA AND THE AIR FORCE.  EACH OF THESE PROJECTS HAS HAD SOME SUCCESS BUT THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGES THAT HAVE MADE NASA RELUCTANT TO INCORPORATE THEM.  ONE OF THE GREATEST CHALLENGES THAT NASA FACES WHEN INCORPORATING ANY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY IS BRIDGING THE MID TECHNICAL READINESS LEVEL (TRL AS DEFINED BY HTTP://ESTO.NASA.GOV/FILES/TRL_DEFINITIONS.PDF) GAP BETWEEN EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND INCORPORATION INTO FLIGHT VEHICLES (ROCKETS).  THE INTENT OF THIS CONTRACT EFFORT IS TO PUSH THE TECHNICAL MATURITY OF COMPOSITE TANKS FURTHER BY BUILDING ON THE DEVELOPMENTS OF RECENT PROGRAMS.  NASAS MOST RECENT COMPOSITE CRYOTANK WAS DEVELOPED UNDER THE NEXT GENERATION LAUNCH TECHNOLOGY (NGLT) PROJECT.  THE COMPOSITE CRYOTANK TECHNOLOGIES AND DEMONSTRATION (CCTD) ALSO HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON NEW IMPROVEMENTS DEVELOPED BY COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE INTERNAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IR&D) ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS OF INTERNATIONAL AND ACADEMIC PARTNERS, AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.  BUILDING ON PAST COMPOSITE CRYOTANK SUCCESSES AND EVALUATING NEW STATE OF THE ART MATERIALS THROUGH EQUIVALENCY TESTING SHOULD ALLOW NASA TO REALIZE CONSIDERABLE MASS AND COST SAVINGS.  IN FISCAL YEAR 2011, NASA PLANS TO BEGIN A PROGRAM THAT FOCUSES ON INNOVATIVE IDEAS ENABLING NEW CAPABILITIES OR RADICALLY ALTERING OUR CURRENT APPROACHES TO SPACE SYSTEMS.  GAME CHANGING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS (GCDP) ARE INTENDED TO BE CAPABILITY-ORIENTED AND DIFFER FROM TRADITIONAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT METHODS THAT ADVANCE DISCIPLINE OR CORE KNOWLEDGE.  THE GOAL OF THE PLANNED GCDP IS TO MATURE TECHNOLOGIES IN PREPARATION FOR POTENTIAL SYSTEM LEVEL FLIGHT DEMONSTRATIONS THROUGH SIGNIFICANT GROUND-BASED TESTING AND/OR LABORATORY EXPERIMENTATION.  NASA WILL MANAGE THE COMPOSITE CRYOTANK TECHNOLOGIES AND DEMONSTRATION PROJECT WITHIN THESE GUIDELINES.    THE CCTD PROJECT WILL BE SPLIT INTO TWO PHASES.  THE CURRENT EFFORT DESCRIBED IN THIS SOW IS PHASE 1.     THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF PHASE 1 COULD RESULT IN NASA ISSUING A SEPARATE 2-YEAR CONTRACT FOR PHASE 2 IF FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE.  PHASE 2 WILL LIKELY INVOLVE THE CRITICAL DESIGN, ANALYSIS, AND MANUFA"""

THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE ERA PROJECT IS TO SELECT VEHICLE CONCEPTS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY REDUCE NOISE, FUEL BURN, AND EMISSIONS.  IN ADDITION, THE ERA PROJECT WILL IDENTIFY AND MITIGATE TECHNICAL RISK AND TRANSFER KNOWLEDGE TO THE AERONAUTICS COMMUNITY AT LARGE SO THAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND VEHICLE CONCEPTS CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO THE FUTURE DESIGN OF AIRCRAFT.  THE ERA PROJECT IS A 6-YEAR, TWO-PHASE PROJECT WITH SEVERAL INTEGRATED TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION (ITD) WORK PACKAGES THAT ARE CURRENTLY DEFINED FOR PHASE II (FY13-FY15).    THE ERA PROJECT (PHASE I) CONCLUDED AN ADVANCED VEHICLE CONCEPTS (AVC) STUDY IN JANUARY 2012 UNDER NASA DRYDEN CONTRACT NND11AG03C WITH BOEING THAT IDENTIFIED ADVANCED INTEGRATED VEHICLE CONCEPTS AND COMPONENT TECHNOLOGY CONCEPTS THAT WILL ALLOW SUBSONIC TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT TO SIMULTANEOUSLY MEET THE NASA SYSTEM LEVEL GOALS OF REDUCED NOISE, EMISSIONS, AND FUEL BURN IN THE 2025 (OR BEYOND) TIMEFRAME.  BOEINGS FINAL REPORT UNDER THIS CONTRACT DEFINED A HYBRID WING BODY (HWB) PREFERRED SYSTEM CONCEPT VEHICLE THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY ACHIEVED ALL SYSTEM LEVEL GOALS.  IN THAT SYSTEM STUDY, MANY ASSUMPTIONS WERE MADE AS TO THE INSTALLATION EFFECTS OF ULTRA HIGH BYPASS RATIO (UHBR) RATIO ENGINES ON THE UPPER SURFACE OF THE VEHICLE CONCEPT.  THERE IS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY IN MANY OF THOSE ASSUMPTIONS.  IN ADDITION, MANY OTHER IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF ENGINE AIRFRAME INTEGRATION WERE BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE NASA DRYDEN AVC STUDY.  ISSUES LIKE INSTALLATION DRAG INCREMENTS ON VEHICLE PERFORMANCE AND FOREBODY DOMINATED FLOWS (ESPECIALLY AT LOW SPEEDS AND HIGH ANGLES OF ATTACK AND SIDESLIP) COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE OPERABILITY OF UHBR ENGINES MOUNTED ON THE UPPER SURFACE OF HWB ADVANCED VEHICLE CONCEPTS.  THESE PROPULSION/AIRFRAME INTEGRATION (PAI) DRIVEN ISSUES MUST BE EXAMINED TO REDUCE THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE AVCS PERFORMANCE AND WILL BE THE FOCUS OF PAI EFFORTS CONDUCTED IN ERA PHASE II.     THE PLANNING PROCESS FOR ERA PROJECT PHASE II INVOLVED SEVERAL KEY DECISION POINTS WHERE VARIOUS TECHNOLOGIES WERE EVALUATED AND SOME WERE SELECTED FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT UNDER SEVERAL ITD WORK PACKAGES.  ONE OF THOSE ITD WORK PACKAGES GIVEN AUTHORITY TO PROCEED BY ARMD INCLUDED THE ASSESSMENT OF UHBR ENGINE OPERABILITY ON A HWB ADVANCED VEHICLE CONCEPT.  AS PART OF THIS ITD WORK PACKAGE, THE SPACE ACT AGREEMENT (SAA) SAA1-1018, ANNEX 7 PLANS TO CAPTURE A COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENT BETWEEN BOEING AND NASA.  UNDER THE SAA, BOEING WILL FURNISH THE HWB MODEL AND NASA WILL FACILITATE THE 14X22 WIND TUNNEL FOR TWO EXPERIMENT TEST CAMPAIGNS.  IN ADDITION, NASA WILL FURNISH A SET OF TURBINE-POWERED SIMULATOR SYSTEMS FOR THE TESTS.    2.0 	SCOPE&OBJECTIVE(S):  THE SCOPE OF THIS TASK ORDER IS TO DEVELOP DETAILED TEST REQUIREMENTS AND PERFORM COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS FOR EXPERIMENT DEVELOPMENT FOR A SUBSCALE WIND TUNNEL EXPERIMENT WITH TWO TEST CAMPAIGNS THAT NASA AND BOEING WILL CONDUCT UNDER THE SAA1-1018, ANNEX 7.  THESE TESTS ARE REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND OPERABILITY ISSUES THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM THE PAI OF AN UHBR ENGINE ON A LOW-NOISE HWB ADVANCED VEHICLE CONFIGURATION AS WELL AS THE LOW SPEED PERFORMANCE RESULTING FROM SUCH INTEGRATION.

VERTICAL TAIL SIZING ON COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT IS DRIVEN, IN LARGE PART, BY PERFORMANCE REQUIRED FOR EMERGENCY SITUATIONS AND/OR OPERATIONS NEAR THE EDGES OF THE FLIGHT ENVELOPE.  FOR AIRCRAFT WHERE THE ENGINES ARE MOUNTED ON THE WINGS, ENGINE-OUT CONDITIONS RELY HEAVILY ON THE RUDDER TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT YAWING MOMENT TO TRIM OUT THE AIRPLANE.  AS PART OF THE ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE AVIATION (ERA) PROJECT, NASA IS SEEKING TO DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF REDUCING VERTICAL TAIL SIZE THROUGH THE USE OF ACTIVE FLOW CONTROL (AFC). THE AFC-ENABLED VERTICAL TAIL WOULD UTILIZE AFC TO PROVIDE REQUIRED PERFORMANCE AT FLIGHT CONDITIONS THAT DRIVE THE SIZING OF THE VERTICAL TAIL WHILE OPERATING IN A CONVENTIONAL MANNER AT ALL OTHER FLIGHT CONDITIONS.

ONE OF THE CHALLENGES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WING LAMINAR FLOW IS PREMATURE LOSS OF LAMINAR FLOW FROM ROUGHNESS INDUCED BY INSECT CONTAMINATION.   NASA WILL FLIGHT TEST BOTH THE AFC MASS FLOW DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM (AFC SYSTEM) AND IAM COATING TECHNOLOGIES ON A COMMERCIAL AIRLINER VERTICAL TAIL AND WING RESPECTIVELY, WITH THE CONTRACTOR PROVIDING FLIGHT SERVICES AND AIRCRAFT ACCESS.

NASA HAS PARTICIPATED WITH OTHER NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IN A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS TO EVALUATE THE STATE OF THE ART IN COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS (CFD) PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY FOR AEROSPACE VEHICLES.  ONE OF THESE WORKSHOPS THAT STARTED IN 1999 IS THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF AERONAUTICS AND ASTRONAUTICS (AIAA) DRAG PREDICTION WORKSHOP (DPW) SERIES.  THE ORGANIZING COMMITTEE OF DPW SERIES IDENTIFIED PREDICTION OF TURBULENT SEPARATED JUNCTURE FLOW AS A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR IMPROVING THE PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY OF TRANSONIC AEROSPACE VEHICLES.  FIVE WORKSHOPS OVER MORE THAN A DECADE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE UNCERTAINTY IN SEPARATION PREDICTION IS AFFECTED BY THE GRID TOPOLOGY, GRID DENSITY, AND TURBULENCE MODEL.  HOWEVER, THERE IS INSUFFICIENT EXPERIMENTAL DATA TO DETERMINE WHICH PREDICTIONS OF THE SEPARATION REGION ARE CORRECT AND WHY OTHER PREDICTIONS ARE NOT CORRECT.  MODERN AEROSPACE VEHICLES HAVE MANY JUNCTURE REGIONS.  AIRPLANES HAVE SIMILAR JUNCTURE FLOWS AT THE WING-BODY, HORIZONTAL TAIL-BODY, VERTICAL TAIL-BODY, WING-PYLON, NACELLE-PYLON, AND FLAP TRACK FAIRING-WING JUNCTURES.  NEXT GENERATION CONFIGURATIONS SUCH AS THE TRUSS-BRACED WING HAVE EVEN LARGER JUNCTURE REGIONS.  THE ABILITY TO PREDICT THE ONSET AND PROGRESSION OF SEPARATION FLOW IN THESE JUNCTURE REGIONS IS CRITICAL TO ACCURATE PREDICTION OF FORCES AND MOMENTS AND THEREFORE CRITICAL TO DESIGN OF FUEL EFFICIENT AND QUIET AIRCRAFT.  ADDITIONALLY, SPACE LAUNCH VEHICLES HAVE SIMILAR JUNCTURE REGIONS.  THE DPW ORGANIZING COMMITTEE DISCUSSED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A UNIT TEST PROBLEM TO PROVIDE VALIDATION DATA FOR CFD PREDICTIONS OF THE JUNCTURE FLOW.  THE ORGANIZING COMMITTEE IDENTIFIED A CONFIGURATION WITH A LIGHTLY LOADED, SHORT WING SPAN THAT COULD BE SCALED LARGE ENOUGH TO ALLOW ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS OF THE MEAN AND TURBULENT FLOW IN THE SEPARATION REGION.  THE VALIDATION TEST WOULD UTILIZE A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE INTERNALLY MOUNTED LASER DOPPLER VELOCIMETRY (LDV) SYSTEM TO MEASURE THE FLOW NEAR THE FUSELAGE AND WING SURFACES IN THE SEPARATED REGION, STATIC PRESSURE PORTS, AND UNSTEADY PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS.  THE WING WOULD BE DESIGNED TO HAVE A PRESSURE GRADIENT SIMILAR TO NASAS COMMON RESEARCH MODEL (CRM) GEOMETRY, WHICH IS AN OPEN GEOMETRY REPRESENTATIVE OF MODERN IN-SERVICE COMMERCIAL TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT.  FURTHER, THE VALIDATION TEST CONFIGURATION WOULD HAVE TWO PLANES OF SYMMETRY: LEFT-RIGHT AND TOP-BOTTOM ALLOWING MULTIPLE ROTATION ANGLES IN THE EXPERIMENTAL TEST MATRIX TO PROVIDE ESTIMATES OF TUNNEL EFFECTS.  MULTIPLE PLANES OF SYMMETRY ARE POWERFUL TOOLS FOR VALIDATION EXPERIMENTS.  THE VALIDATION TEST WILL BE DESIGNED WITH FOUR FLOW TYPES: 1) ATTACHED FLOW, 2) INCIPIENT SEPARATION, 3) SMALL WING-BODY SEPARATION, AND 4) LARGE SCALE SEPARATION.    BOEING, AS PART OF THE DPW ORGANIZING COMMITTEE, DEVELOPED A DESIGN OF A JUNCTURE FLOW MODEL.  THIS FIRST DESIGN WAS DETERMINED TO BE INSUFFICIENT TO MOUNT THE INTERNAL INSTRUMENTATION, AND BOEING SUBSEQUENTLY PROVIDED AN UPDATED DESIGN TO THE DPW ORGANIZING COMMITTEE.  ANALYSIS OF THIS MODEL AT NASA LANGLEY IDENTIFIED THAT THE MODEL DID NOT PROVIDE THE FOUR FLOW TYPES, THE FUSELAGE WAS TOO NARROW TO ACCOMMODATE THE INTERNAL INSTRUMENTATION AND TRAVERSE SYSTEM, AND THE EXIT AREA OF THE FUSELAGE WAS TOO SMALL TO ACCOMMODATE ALL OF THE INSTRUMENTATION CABLING THAT WAS REQUIRED.  THE WORK DESCRIBED IN THIS TASK ORDER IS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH AN OPEN, PUBLIC-DOMAIN GEOMETRY FOR THE OUTER MOLD LINE OF THE JUNCTURE FLOW MODEL THAT ADDRESSES THE ISSUES WITH THE PREVIOUS DESIGN.

THE FW PROJECT PURSUES A MULTI-GENERATIONAL APPROACH ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF TODAY BUT WITH AN EMPHASIS ON ESTABLISHING THE TECHNOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS NECESSARY TO ENABLE THE CAPABILITIES NEEDED IN THE DECADES AHEAD.  NASA SUBSONIC TRANSPORT SYSTEM LEVEL METRICS/GOALS ARE SHOWN BELOW IN TABLE 1.  TABLE 1:  NASA''S TECHNOLOGY GOALS FOR FUTURE SUBSONIC VEHICLES   THIS EFFORT IS INTENDED TO IDENTIFY HIGH PAY-OFF RESEARCH THAT BUILDS ON THE EXISTING KNOWLEDGE AND RESULTS OF THE TRUSS-BRACED WING (TBW) RESEARCH TO FURTHER REFINE AND ADVANCE THE TBW DESIGN CONFIGURATION AND VALIDATE THE LIFT/DRAG (L/D) AERODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE FOR ON AND OFF DESIGN CONDITIONS.  THE TBW IS A TECHNOLOGY CONCEPT THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CHANGE THE DESIGN SPACE BY AFFECTING THE TRADES BETWEEN WING SWEEP, THICKNESS, SPEED, LIFT, AND WEIGHT.  THESE TRADES CAN ENABLE VERY HIGH ASPECT RATIO, HIGH SPAN WINGS THAT MAY CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO AN OVERALL FUEL BURN REDUCTION GOAL OF -60% FOR TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT ENTERING INTO SERVICE IN THE 2030-35 TIMEFRAME, MARKET PERMITTING, RELATIVE TO 2005 BEST-IN-CLASS AIRCRAFT.   CURRENT AERODYNAMIC PREDICTIONS FOR HIGH-SPEED AND LOW-SPEED AERODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE FOR HIGH SPAN TBWS ARE LIMITED BY A SHORTAGE OF RELEVANT EMPIRICAL DATA.  THIS UNCERTAINTY, WHEN CYCLED THROUGH PERFORMANCE AND SIZING, RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS IN AIRCRAFT WING AREA AND OTHER PARAMETERS IMPORTANT TO THE WING DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION.  CRUISE DRAG UNCERTAINTY IS PRIMARILY CAUSED BY UNKNOWN STRUT-WING INTERFERENCE.  EMPIRICAL DATA FOR A TRANSONIC STRUT-WING FAIRING IS NOT KNOWN TO EXIST.  ADDITIONALLY, NACELLES ARE QUITE DIFFERENT THAN STRUTS AND THE ATTAINABLE LEVEL OF INTERFERENCE IS CURRENTLY UNKNOWN.   LOW-SPEED ANALYSES AND OPTIMIZATION OF SPANWISE FLAP DEFLECTION IS NECESSARY FOR AN ACCURATE PREDICTION OF TAKEOFF PERFORMANCE. THIS RESULTS IN UNCERTAINTY IN THE LOW-SPEED PERFORMANCE OF THE AIRCRAFT AS LIFT TO DRAG RATIO IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT AS MAXIMUM LIFT COEFFICIENT.  EXISTING METHODS FOR DETERMINING THE DYNAMIC EFFECTS OF LARGE ROLL AND PITCH RATES ARE INSUFFICIENT FOR HIGH ASPECT RATIO WINGS.   ROLL DAMPING ESTIMATES BASED ON CONVENTIONAL WING ASPECT RATIOS MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO ESTIMATE ROLL CONTROL POWER REQUIRED.  EFFECTS OF AILERON AND/OR SPOILER DEFLECTION MUST BE CONSIDERED IN THE PERFORMANCE AND IN AEROELASTIC COUPLING TO THE SPANLOAD AND THUS TO THE ROLL DAMPING.  DUE TO THE HIGH WING SPAN, ALLOWABLE ROLL ANGLE FOR TAKEOFF AND LANDING WILL BE LOWER THAN A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT, POSSIBLY AFFECTING CROSSWIND CONTROL.  ANOTHER POTENTIAL CONCERN IS THE ROLL-YAW COUPLING. THE HIGH SPAN WING, ESPECIALLY AT HIGH ROLL RATES THAT CAN RESULT IN SEPARATED FLOW NEAR THE WING TIPS, CAN LEAD TO UNUSUALLY LARGE YAWING MOMENT COEFFICIENT DUE TO ROLL RATE DERIVATIVE (I.E., CNP VALUES) VALUES WHICH MAY AFFECT VERTICAL TAIL SIZING BEYOND THE NORMAL TRIM, ENGINE-OUT, AND DIRECTIONAL STABILITY CRITERIA.  FOR THE PITCH AXIS, UNDERSTANDING CHANGES IN BASIC WING+BODY STABILITY LEVELS IN BOTH THE CRUISE AND IN THE HIGH-LIFT CONFIGURATIONS IS ALSO ESSENTIAL.   IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THESE UNCERTAINTIES, HIGHER FIDELITY AERODYNAMIC DATA AT OFF-DESIGN CONDITIONS ARE NEEDED TO AUGMENT AND IMPROVE THE STRUCTURES, LOADS, AND STABILITY AND CONTROL ANALYSES IN ADDITION TO THE PRIMARY ON-DESIGN CRUISE DRAG (L/D) FOR THE TBW CONFIGURATION.    2.0 	SCOPE, OBJECTIVE(S), APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS, AND ACRONYMS:    2.1	SCOPE:  THE SCOPE OF THIS TASK ORDER IS TO REFINE THE DESIGN OF A TRANSONIC TBW AIRCRAFT WITH HIGH-FIDELITY TOOLS, AND ANY R"

THREE MAIN FOCUS AREAS, OR TECHNICAL CHALLENGES, HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY NASA AND INDUSTRY AS HAVING MAJOR IMPACT ON THE CURRENT CERTIFICATION TIMELINE.  THE ACP THIRD TECHNICAL CHALLENGE (TC3), MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND SIMULATION, IS CONCERNED WITH REDUCING THE OCCURRENCE OF DEFECTS WHICH COMMONLY OCCUR IN AEROSPACE COMPOSITE STRUCTURES AS A RESULT OF THE PROCESSING METHODS UTILIZED TO FABRICATE THESE LARGE, HIGHLY COMPLEX VEHICLES.  ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES IN TC3 IS TO DEVELOP PHYSICS-BASED PROCESS MODELS WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF ACCURATELY PREDICTING THE FORMATION OF DEFECTS DURING ROBOTIC, AUTOMATED FIBER PLACEMENT (AFP) OF COMPOSITE STRUCTURE.  WHILE THE EFFICIENCY DEMONSTRATED IN AFP HAS LED TO ITS ADOPTION BY THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY FOR FABRICATION OF AIRCRAFT FUSELAGE, WING, AND ENGINE NACELLE PRIMARY COMPOSITE STRUCTURES, THE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY REALIZED DUE TO THE OCCURRENCE OF PERFORMANCE REDUCING DEFECTS WHICH RESULT IN COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING REWORK.   THE DEVELOPMENT OF ACCURATE AFP PROCESS MODELS WILL GIVE AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS THE ABILITY TO PREDICT DEFECTS WHICH OCCUR DUE TO THE PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MATERIAL, THE PART TOOLING, AND THE AFP PROCESSING PARAMETERS.  THIS SCIENCE-BASED APPROACH TO MAXIMIZING PART QUALITY HAS PROVEN SUCCESSFUL IN OTHER COMPOSITE PROCESSING METHODOLOGIES SUCH AS INFUSION FLOW PREDICTION AND CURE PROCESS DEFECTS SUCH AS RESIDUAL STRESS.  HOWEVER, CURRENTLY NO VALIDATED PHYSICS-BASED PROCESS MODEL EXISTS TO PREDICT DEFECTS SUCH AS FIBER / TAPE BUCKLING, ALSO REFERRED TO AS FIBER WAVINESS, WRINKLING, PUCKERING, OR WINDOW-SHADING.  AN AFP PROCESS MODEL WHICH ACCURATELY PREDICTS PROCESS DEFECTS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE TRIAL AND ERROR FABRICATION EFFORT REQUIRED TO MEET PRODUCTION CERTIFICATION OF AEROSPACE COMPOSITE STRUCTURE.    THE WORK DESCRIBED IN THIS SOW IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS FABRICATION ISSUES THAT HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE TIMELINE REQUIRED TO CERTIFY COMPOSITE STRUCTURES. THE INTENTION OF THIS TASK ORDER IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE AFP PROCESS PARAMETERS DURING THE FABRICATION OF PARTS WHICH IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO CONTAIN DEFECTS SUCH AS WRINKLING OR PUCKERING. THE GOVERNMENT WILL UTILIZE A WELL CHARACTERIZED AEROSPACE TOUGHENED EPOXY MATERIAL, HEXCEL IM7 / 8552-1 PREPREG, SO THAT THE CHARACTERIZATION STUDY IS FOCUSED ON THE AFP PLACEMENT PARAMETERS WHICH AFFECT THE FORMATION OF THE WRINKLING / PUCKERING DEFECTS. THESE PROCESSING PARAMETERS, FOR EXAMPLE, INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: PLACEMENT SPEED, COMPACTION LOAD, MATERIAL TEMPERATURE, AND/OR HEAD TURNING RADIUS. THE GEOMETRY USED TO EVALUATE THE VARIOUS AFP PROCESSING PARAMETERS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE TYPE AND FORM WHICH HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN PREVIOUS BUILDS BY THE FABRICATOR TO RESULT IN FORMATION OF THE WRINKLING / PUCKERING DEFECTS. THE RESULTS OF THIS AFP PROCESSING CHARACTERIZATION EFFORT WILL BE UTILIZED IN THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF AN AFP PHYSICS-BASED PROCESS MODEL TO PREDICT THESE TYPES OF DEFECTS.  2.0	SCOPE&OBJECTIVE(S):  2.1	THE SCOPE OF THIS TASK ORDER IS TO FABRICATE COMPOSITE PANELS USING THE AFP PROCESS AND CHARACTERIZE THE AFP PROCESS BY MEASURING THE PROCESSING PARAMETERS WHICH RESULT IN FIBER / TAPE BUCKLING DEFECTS (WRINKLING / PUCKERING).        2.2	THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS TASK ORDER ARE TO:  A.

OVERALL, THE USE OF A SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL (SOFC)-ENABLED ELECTRIC PROPULSION ARCHITECTURE HAS THE MOST PROMISE TO ENABLE TRANSITION TO ELECTRIC PROPULSION.  THE SOFC ENABLED ELECTRIC PROPULSION SYSTEM CAN REFORM TRADITIONAL FUELS INTO ELECTRICITY AT HIGH EFFICIENCY, THUS ADDING NO INFRASTRUCTURE COST OR UTILITY PENALTY   THE AIRCRAFT CAN USE THE EXACT SAME AIRPORTS AND FUEL DEPOTS AS BEFORE.  THE HIGH EFFICIENCY OF THE SOFC VS. THE ICE RESULTS IN LESS FUEL USAGE (AND THEREFORE LOWER OPERATING COSTS), AND IS DIRECTLY CORRELATED WITH LOWER CARBON EMISSIONS.  IN ADDITION, THE REDUCTION IN TEMPERATURE OF THE SOFC REFORMER VS. ICE COMBUSTION LEADS TO ELIMINATION OF NITROGEN OXIDES FROM THE EXHAUST.  THIS STUDY EFFORT COMPRISES A SOFC SYSTEM DESIGN AND INSTALLATION TO ENABLE AN INNOVATIVE ELECTRIC AIRCRAFT.  THIS TASK ORDER IS A RESULT OF A COMPETITIVE SELECTION OF A 2015 AERONAUTICS RESEARCH MISSION DIRECTORATE (ARMD) SEEDLING PHASE I PROPOSAL THROUGH THE NASA AERONAUTICS RESEARCH INSTITUTE (NARI).     2.0 	SCOPE&OBJECTIVE(S):  2.1	THE SCOPE OF THIS TASK ORDER IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF MERGING A SOFC-ENABLED ELECTRIC PROPULSION ARCHITECTURE WITH AN EXISTING LIGHT AIRCRAFT DESIGN BY DEFINING A CANDIDATE POWER ARCHITECTURE WHILE QUANTIFYING PERFORMANCE, COST, AND RISK.  THIS TASK ORDER WILL GENERATE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN DATA AND TEST PLANS FOR A SELECTED SOFC ARCHITECTURE AND SUPPORT THE VETTING OF THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN THROUGH TWO COMPLETE DESIGN CYCLE ITERATIONS.   2.2	THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS TASK ORDER ARE TO:   	DEFINE THE DESIGN SPACE AND DEVELOP REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SOFC SYSTEM.

(Reference: NASA AMRD NRA NNH06ZEA001N Amendment 4, Appendix A.2, Topic A.2.4 Hybrid Wing/Body Technologies). The new technologies for this effort are directed primarily towards meeting the reduced noise goal. While the SAX-40 based geometry being proposed offers substantially improved fuel burn, the fuel burn goal is somewhat secondary in that the focus of the changes to the geometry are to meet the noise goal. Thus, the plan is to determine the fuel burn advantages of the configuration including impacts of potential changes to reduce noise. Since LTO NOx emissions are from the engine, emissions technology development needs to be done as an engine discipline. Therefore, this effort is to enable development of prediction methods with wind tunnel test validations using a fuel-efficient hybrid wing body configuration based on the non-proprietary CMI SAX-40 geometry. The NASA long-term goal is to develop high-fidelity physics-based prediction methods. Most of the very low flyover noise potential of the hybrid wing body derives from noise shielding for which validated fundamental prediction methods are still in an early state of development. Thus, a non-proprietary 3D definition representative of a flyable efficient transport suitable for wind tunnel testing needs to be created in Phase 1. A major portion of the following Phase 2 proposed effort is to design and build a wind tunnel model with test configuration requirements guided by development of the predictive methods. Advancing prediction methodologies for noise shielding will initially start with empiricism to identify the needs. As investigations continue into years 2 and 3, increasing fidelity refinements will be incorporated. The wind tunnel model will be designed and wind tunnel tested for low-speed aerodynamic and noise data in Phase 2 (year 2 and year 3 respectively)."

IN GENERAL, THESE AREAS ARE EXPECTED TO BECOME HOTTER AND DRIER, WITH MORE VARIABLE RAINFALL AND REDUCED RATES OF SURFACE WATER RUNOFF AND GROUNDWATER RECHARGE. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, INSTITUTIONS GOVERNING THE ALLOCATION OF WATER ACROSS USERS WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT. IT IS CRITICAL TO DEVELOP A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WATER ALLOCATION INSTITUTIONS FACILITATE OR IMPEDE CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION BY AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS. DOING SO WILL AID IN DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT REGIONAL, NATIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL POLICIES THAT ADDRESS THE MULTIFACETED IMPACTS OF CHANGING CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. THE KEY CONTRIBUTION OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO EXAMINE HOW WATER RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS IN THE U.S. INTERMOUNTAIN WEST INFLUENCE AGRICULTURAL DECISION-MAKING. THE SUPPLY OF WATER IN THE REGION, WHICH IS DRIVEN BY UNCERTAIN WEATHER AND CLIMATE FACTORS, DRIVES AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY, THE VALUE OF AGRICULTURAL LAND, AND PRODUCERS  LAND-USE DECISIONS. UNDERSTANDING OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE HAS PROVEN ELUSIVE TO DATE BECAUSE WATER ALLOCATION INSTITUTIONS COMPLICATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CLIMATE-DRIVEN CHANGES IN WATER AVAILABILITY AND PRODUCER DECISION-MAKING. SPECIFICALLY, CLIMATE AND WEATHER GOVERN THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF WATER INFLOWS INTO A REGION, BUT THE AMOUNT OF WATER AVAILABLE TO A PRODUCER ALSO DEPENDS ON THE PRESENCE OF WATER STORAGE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE STRUCTURE OF WATER RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS. WATER RIGHTS, WHICH GOVERN HOW WATER IS DISTRIBUTED ACROSS USERS, ARE COMPLEX AND EXHIBIT SUBSTANTIAL SPATIOTEMPORAL HETEROGENEITY, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE HOW INSTITUTIONS AFFECT PRODUCER BEHAVIOR. THIS PROJECT PROPOSES TO EXAMINE THE IMPACTS OF VARIATION IN WATER AVAILABILITY AND THE STRUCTURE OF WATER ALLOCATION INSTITUTIONS ON AGRICULTURAL LAND-USE DECISIONS IN THE SNAKE RIVER BASIN. OUR EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS EXPLOITS HETEROGENEITY IN WATER RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS ACROSS STATE BORDERS WITHIN THE STUDY REGION TO IDENTIFY THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS ON AGRICULTURAL LAND-USE DECISIONS. TO CONDUCT THE ANALYSIS, WE WILL USE REMOTE SENSING DATA TO IDENTIFY IRRIGATED AND RAINFED AGRICULTURAL LANDS, INTEGRATING THAT DATA INTO AN ECONOMETRIC MODEL EXPLAINING PRODUCER BEHAVIOR. WE WILL USE AN ESTABLISHED METHOD OF COMBINING COMPLEMENTARY LANDSAT AND MODIS DATASETS TO GENERATE A PANEL OF LAND-USE OBSERVATIONS LONG ENOUGH TO CAPTURE CHANGES IN CLIMATE AND AT A SPATIAL RESOLUTION CONSISTENT WITH THE INDIVIDUAL DECISION-MAKER.

IN LIGHT OF THE INCREASING AMOUNT OF ATTENTION DEVOTED TO THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, AND TO THE POTENTIAL NEGATIVE OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH LAND-USE CHANGE, THE RESULTS OF THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL BE HIGHLY RELEVANT TO POLICYMAKERS.

ALTERED FIRE REGIMES ARE TRANSFORMING NATIVE SHRUB-DOMINATED LANDSCAPES TO ANNUAL INVASIVE GRASSES, THUS PERPETUATING THE FIRE CYCLE. WOODY PLANT EXPANSION CAN LEAD TO CHANGES IN LANDSCAPE ECOHYDROLOGY, DEGRADATION OF SOIL NUTRIENTS, AND INCREASED FIRE RISK AT THE URBAN FRINGE. CONSEQUENTLY, TECHNIQUES TO QUANTIFY VEGETATION STRUCTURE AND PREDICT CHANGING VEGETATION STRUCTURAL PATTERNS IN DRYLAND SYSTEM UNDER FUTURE SCENARIOS ARE NECESSARY TO ADDRESS NUMEROUS QUESTIONS RELATED TO QUANTIFYING VULNERABILITIES TO AND RESPONSES OF GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES. FOR EXAMPLE, WILL WARMER TEMPERATURES AND HIGHER INTENSITY AND FREQUENCY FIRES IN CALIFORNIA S MEDITERRANEAN ECOSYSTEM CAUSE AN IRREVERSIBLE SHIFT FROM A SHRUBLAND-DOMINATED ECOSYSTEM TO ONE OF NON-NATIVE ANNUAL GRASSES AND EXOTIC WEEDS? SIMILARLY WILL THE SHRUBLAND-DOMINATED GREAT BASIN BE CONVERTED TO ANNUAL GRASSES AND HOW WILL THE CONVERSION RATE VARY WITH INTERANNUAL PRECIPITATION AND CLIMATE?

OUR RESEARCH APPROACH IS TO COLLECT NEW AIRBORNE LIDAR AND HYPERSPECTRAL DATASETS OVER A CLIMATE AND ELEVATION GRADIENT OF THE GREAT BASIN WHERE THE RESEARCHERS HAVE EXISTING FIELD, HYPERSPECTRAL, AND LIDAR DATASETS. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION IS TO SYNTHESIZE EXISTING AND NEW GROUND AND AIRBORNE DATASETS TO QUANTIFY METRICS SUCH AS HEIGHT, COVER, BIOMASS AND LAI.

WE WILL DEVELOP REGIONALLY SCALED LIDAR / HYPERSPECTRAL VEGETATION PRODUCTS IN ANTICIPATION OF A NEED TO DETERMINE HOW BEST TO ASSIMILATE THE GROWING NUMBER OF THESE SITE-LEVEL COLLECTIONS (G-LIHT (GSFC), CARNEGIE AIRBORNE OBSERVATORY, NEON AOP), WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY BE LINKED TO SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS.

DRAWING FROM MY MATH AND PHYSICS KNOWLEDGE, I THINK APPLYING FRACTAL GEOMETRY CONCEPTS TO WEATHER COULD ALLOW BETTER PREDICTION OF CERTAIN WEATHER EVENTS, SUCH AS SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS AND EXTREME WEATHER, INCLUDING HURRICANES AND TORNADOES. AN ASPECT OF THIS CHALLENGE IS DESIGNING AIRCRAFT TO BE MORE RESISTANT TO WEATHER-RELATED IMPEDANCE, WHICH REQUIRES THE IMPROVEMENT OR REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING AIRCRAFT MATERIALS.

THE CARBON FIBER WOULD PROVIDE EXTERNAL RIGIDITY AND TOUGHNESS, WHILE THE EXTREMELY LIGHT AEROGEL WOULD MAINTAIN THE STRUCTURE. THE LESSENED MASS OF THE AIRCRAFT WOULD CUT DOWN ON THE AMOUNT OF FUEL CONSUMED. THE CARBON FIBER WOULD ALSO BE AN IMPROVED PROTECTION AGAINST WEATHER-RELATED DAMAGE.

DIFFICULTIES OF ESTIMATING WATER VOLUMES STORED IN SNOW ARE WELL DOCUMENTED. IN SITU MEASUREMENT OVER LARGE AREAS IS CHALLENGING BECAUSE STANDARD TECHNIQUES ARE TIME CONSUMING, WHILE CORRELATION LENGTHS OF SNOW PROPERTIES ARE ON THE ORDER OF 100 M. LONG-TERM SNOW MONITORING NETWORKS REQUIRE A LONG HISTORICAL RECORD TO BE MEANINGFUL FOR STREAMFLOW PREDICTION, AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO AVERAGE REGIONAL SNOW CONDITIONS CAN BE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN, ESPECIALLY IN A CHANGING CLIMATE.

THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO FURTHER ADVANCE FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE EVOLUTION OF SEASONAL SNOWPACKS IMPACTS REMOTE SENSING OF SNOW AT DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS. IN THIS PROJECT WE FOCUS ON RETRIEVAL OF SWE AT HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTIONS USING MULTIPLE-FREQUENCY MICROWAVE RADAR, LEVERAGING FREQUENCIES ALREADY USED FOR WATER CYCLE REMOTE SENSING.

The physical mechanisms that cause large-scale density irregularities and scintillations at the equatorial regions are not yet fully understood. Especially, the longitudinal variability of bubble occurrence is still an outstanding question. This is evident in satellite observations that show very unique and more intense equatorial anomaly structures and scintillation activity in the African region than any other regions. In addition, recent measurements of TEC depletions over South America have revealed that usually they occur in patches extending for 100s of km, but quite often they occupy the whole continent. Therefore, to address the above fundamental problems, data from several different ground- and space-based instruments will be utilized. Pairs of magnetometers in the American and African sectors will be used to estimate vertical drifts. Data from Ion Velocity Meter (IVM) and Vector Electric Field Instrument (VEFI) instruments on board C/NOFS will also provide vertical drifts at different altitudes. Simultaneously, ACE satellite data will help understand the role of the penetration electric field, for processes governing equatorial ionospheric electrodynamics during storm conditions. GPS receivers on the ground and in space (LEO satellites) will resolve space-time ambiguity and will be able to track the evolution of equatorial ionospheric irregularities. New ionosondes recently installed in the African and South American equatorial and anomaly peak regions will provide bottom side densities, drifts near sunset times and the meridional winds. The PLP sensor on C/NOFS and the density instrument on DMSP will give information about the maximum penetration altitude of plasma bubbles. This 4-year proposal aims to use this instrumentation to quantify the effect that the upper thermosphere in the form of propagating migrating/non-migrating tides and planetary waves, originated in the troposphere, have on the ionospheric dynamics and on the development and decay of plasma bubbles. This investigation aims to relate the day-to-day variability of F-region dynamics to the variability of the inputs from below. This complete specification of the driving winds will allow us to calculate plasma drifts for longitudes and times that do not have direct plasma drift measurements. During disturbed conditions, the more complete assessment of the thermospheric inputs in two continents (e.g. disturbed dynamo effect) will make it possible to single out effects due to prompt penetration electric fields. We will also utilize the capability of existent GPS receivers and ionosondes in Africa and South America to observe gravity waves (GW) and study their seeding conditions in these two continents. By adopting an observational strategy rich in instrumental diversity and a scientific initiative that seeks the primary causes of the day-to-day variability and the longitudinal dependence of the occurrence of the plasma bubbles, we will be addressing the focused science topic (a) Low- to Mid-Latitude Ionospheric Irregularities and Turbulence."

CURRENT SHEETS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN WHITE LIGHT (WL) CORONAGRAPH IMAGES OF CMES AS NARROW RAYS TRAILING THE OUTWARD-MOVING CME CORE, AND IN UV SPECTRA AS NARROW, HIGH TEMPERATURE FEATURES. SCIENTIFIC PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION WE PROPOSE AN INVESTIGATION OF CME CSS USING IMAGING AND SPECTRAL OBSERVATIONS TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS:   WHAT ARE THE DYNAMICS AND PLASMA CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CSS THROUGHOUT THE CORONA?   WHAT ARE THE 3-D CHARACTERISTICS OF WL CSS?   ARE THESE RESULTS CONSISTENT WITH RECONNECTION CME MODELS; HOW CAN WE CONSTRAIN/REFINE THE MODELS? METHODOLOGY WE HAVE ASSEMBLED A TEAM WITH WORLD-CLASS EXPERTISE IN STUDYING CMES AND RELATED CSS USING BOTH IMAGING AND SPECTRAL DATA. THE TEAM WILL ANALYZE DATA FROM THE SOHO, STEREO, HINODE AND SDO MISSIONS. WE WILL USE AND EXTEND CATALOGS OF WL CME-RAYS (CSS), UVCS CMES AND CSS, AND OF ERUPTIVE EVENTS WITH CSS OBSERVED IN THE LOW CORONA. THE DATA WILL INCLUDE CMES AND RAYS (CSS) OBSERVED BY SOHO (LASCO, UVCS AND EIT) FROM 1996 TO THE PRESENT AND BY STEREO SECCHI, HINODE XRT AND EIS, AND SDO AIA INSTRUMENTS FROM 2007 TO THE PRESENT. WE PROPOSE A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF CME CSS IN A 3-PHASE STUDY: PHASE 1) COMPLETE THE SOHO STUDY BY ANALYSIS OF THE BEST LASCO-UVCS RAY EVENTS, DETERMINE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE WL RAYS THROUGH THE OUTER CORONA USING BOTH LASCO C2 AND C3 IMAGES AND NEAR THE SURFACE USING EIT IMAGES, AND EXTEND THE WL RAY CATALOG TO THE PRESENT TO INCLUDE THE STEREO, HINODE AND SDO OBSERVATION PERIODS. PHASE 2) ANALYZE THE 3-D CHARACTERISTICS OF THE WL RAYS USING BOTH THE LASCO AND SECCHI COR CORONAGRAPH IMAGES, BASED ON A STUDY BY PATSOURAKOS AND VOURLIDAS (2011). PHASE 3) USE THE OVERLAPPING OBSERVATIONS TO STUDY THE LOW CORONA CHARACTERISTICS OF CSS WITH HINODE XRT AND EIS, SDO AIA AND SECCHI EUVI DATA, AND COMPARE THESE RESULTS WITH THE OUTER CORONA WL RAYS.

THAT MATERIAL, ENRICHED BY THE NUCLEOSYNTHETIC PRODUCTS CREATED DEEP IN A STARS INTERIOR, IS RECYCLED INTO THE INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM TO FORM THE NEXT GENERATIONS OF STARS AND PLANETS AND, OVER TIME, CHANGES THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE GALAXY.

A HOT DEVICE PRODUCES HUNDREDS OF INDEPENDENTLY-STEERABLE AND INDEPENDENTLY-FOCUSABLE BEAMS, AS WELL AS OTHER ARBITRARILY-COMPLEX 3D ILLUMINATION PATTERNS. HOT IS USEFUL FOR COLLOIDAL RESEARCH, WITH THE ABILITY TO PRECISELY POSITION COLLECTIONS OF PARTICLES WITHIN COLLOIDS, AND TO USE OPTICALLY-TRAPPED PARTICLES TO MEASURE LINEAR AND NONLINEAR VISCOELASTIC PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS. EACH HOT BEAM CAN BE A TRADITIONAL TRAPPING BEAM, OR CAN IMPART ROTATIONAL ANGULAR MOMENTUM TO PARTICLES VIA BESSEL BEAM PROFILES. HOT SYSTEMS ARE ALSO USED IN BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH, FOR EXAMPLE IN MEASURING THE MOBILITY AND DEFORMABILITY OF CELLS (A MEASURE OF CELLULAR HEALTH, AND AN INDICATOR OF DAMAGE), AND IN ROTATING OR SORTING INDIVIDUAL CELLS. ALL OF THESE CAPABILITIES ARE POSSIBLE USING THE SAME HARDWARE, WITH BEAM CONFIGURATION, POWER, AND MOTION CONTROLLED ENTIRELY BY SOFTWARE AND VOLTAGE APPLIED TO A MOTIONLESS SOLID-STATE DEVICE.

FOLLOWING ON FROM SEAWIFS AND MODIS MISSIONS, THE  PRE-AEROSOL, CLOUD, OCEAN ECOSYSTEM (PACE) MISSION IS DESIGNED TO FULFILL THE CLIMATE CONTINUITY REQUIREMENTS, WITH A LAUNCH READINESS IN THE TIME FRAME OF 7 YEARS. BEYOND THE ESTIMATION OF PHYTOPLANKTON CHLOROPHYLL CONCENTRATION, THE GOALS OF PACE ARE TO PROVIDE \CLIMATE-QUALITY GLOBAL OCEAN COLOR MEASUREMENTS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING THE CARBON CYCLE AND GLOBAL OCEAN ECOLOGY AND DETERMINING HOW THE OCEAN''S ROLE IN GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL (CARBON) CYCLING AND OCEAN ECOLOGY BOTH AFFECTS AND IS AFFECTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE.\"" AMONG THE IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE OCEAN COLOR SPECIFICATIONS ARE INCREASED SPECTRAL AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION. ONE OF THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES OF THE PACE MISSION IS THE RETRIEVAL OF THE INHERENT OPTICAL PROPERTIES (IOPS), ABSORPTION AND BACKSCATTERING, VIA OCEAN COLOR INVERSION ALGORITHMS. THE  CAPABILITY FOR RETRIEVING SPECTRAL PHYTOPLANKTON ABSORPTION COEFFICIENTS IS KEY TO ADDRESSING QUESTIONS OF CARBON CYCLING AND OCEAN ECOLOGY AS THESE COEFFICIENTS PROVIDE NOT ONLY AN ESTIMATE OF ALGAL CONCENTRATION (THAT CAN BE LINKED BY PROXY TO ALGAL CARBON) BUT ALSO TO ALGAL COMPOSITION VIA  PIGMENT-BASED TAXONOMIC DISCRIMINATION. PIGMENT-BASED TAXONOMIC COMPOSITION PROVIDES A KEY APPROACH TO DEFINING PHYTOPLANKTON FUNCTIONAL TYPES (PFTS) AS MANY OF THE PIGMENT-BASED LINEAGES COINCIDE WITH BIOGEOCHEMICAL NICHES, CALCIFIERS, SILICIFIERS, NITROGEN FIXERS, ETC. ONE CHALLENGE FOR THE PACE MISSION IS TO DEFINE ROBUST PROTOCOLS WITH QUANTIFIED UNCERTAINTY TERMS FOR CONSTRUCTING VALIDATION DATA SETS FOR PHYTOPLANKTON ABSORPTION. WHILE IN SITU OPTICAL TECHNOLOGIES EXIST TO  MEASURE HYPERSPECTRAL ABSORPTION ON THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES APPROACHING THOSE REQUIRED FOR SATELLITE VALIDATION, EXTRACTING THE SIGNATURE ASSOCIATED SOLELY WITH PHYTOPLANKTON CANNOT CURRENTLY BE PERFORMED ANALYTICALLY AND THUS WE RELY ON MODEL ESTIMATES. MEASURING PHYTOPLANKTON ABSORPTION REQUIRES COLLECTION OF DISCRETE WATER SAMPLES, COLLECTING THE PARTICLES ON GLASS FIBER FILTERS TO REMOVE THE OPTICAL CONTRIBUTION BY COLORED DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER (CDOM), AND MEASURING THE ABSORPTION SPECTROPHOTOMETRICALLY BEFORE AND AFTER PIGMENT  EXTRACTION. THE ABSORPTION BY THE PHYTOPLANKTON PIGMENTS IN VIVO IS CALCULATED BY DIFFERENCE. HOWEVER, THE FILTER PAD CONTAMINATES THE SIGNAL DUE TO ITS STRONG SCATTERING PROPERTIES AND ADDITIONALLY AMPLIFIES THE OPTICAL PATHLENGTH OF TRANSMITTED PHOTONS IN THE SPECTROPHOTOMETER. THESE TWO ERROR SOURCES ARE INADVERTENTLY COMBINED INTO A SINGLE CORRECTION FACTOR, BETA, CALLED THE PATHLENGTH  AMPLIFICATION FACTOR. MANY RESEARCHERS OVER THE YEARS HAVE INVESTIGATED THIS FACTOR USING A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES AND TECHNOLOGIES AND YET IT REMAINS THE LARGEST SOURCE OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE QUANTIFICATION OF PHYTOPLANKTON ABSORPTION. UNFORTUNATELY, MODELS FOR EXTRACTING THE PHYTOPLANKTON ABSORPTION FROM IN SITU OBSERVATIONS OF WHOLE WATER OR PARTICULATE ABSORPTION ARE BASED UPON LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS IN WHICH BETA WAS POORLY CONSTRAINED AT WORST, OR AT BEST FOR WHICH THE UNCERTAINTIES WERE NOT QUANTIFIED. THUS IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE NEED FOR OCEAN COLOR VALIDATION OF PHYTOPLANKTON ABSORPTION COEFFICIENTS, A UNIFIED APPROACH LINKING THE QUANTITATIVE FILTER PAD  TECHNIQUE TO CONTINUOUS IN SITU ABSORPTION OBSERVATIONS IS REQUIRED AND IS THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THIS PROPOSAL. THE SECONDARY FOCUS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER MULTISPECTRAL CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE CAN PROVIDE A QUANTITATIVE PROXY FOR PHYTOPLANKTON ABSORPTION AT THE  EXCITATION WAVELENGTHS. THIS APPROACH WOULD EXPAND THE OPPORTUN"""

THIS IS OF CONCERN GIVEN THAT CHRONIC SLEEP LOSS IS HIGHLY PREVALENT DURING SPACE MISSIONS, WHICH ALSO OFTEN REQUIRE MAINTENANCE OF UNUSUAL SLEEP-WAKE AND WORK SCHEDULES THAT THE CIRCADIAN SYSTEM DOES NOT READILY ADAPT TO, FURTHER INCREASING SLEEPINESS AND REDUCING SLEEP. IN SUCH A HIGH-RISK ENVIRONMENT, THE RISK OF SLEEPINESS-RELATED PERFORMANCE IMPAIRMENT MUST BE MINIMIZED. IT IS ALSO INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED THAT THE RESPONSE TO SLEEP LOSS AND CIRCADIAN DESYNCHRONY IS HIGHLY INDIVIDUALIZED AND BOTH CHALLENGE- AND TASK-DEPENDENT. THIS HIGH DEGREE OF INTER-INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHO WILL BE AT RISK AND WHEN THEY WILL BE AT RISK, AND THEREFORE A `ONE-SIZEFITS-ALL  APPROACH IS LIKELY TO BE SUBOPTIMAL. WHAT IS NEEDED ARE BIOMARKERS OF INDIVIDUAL VULNERABILITIES AND RESILIENCIES TO SLEEP LOSS AND CIRCADIAN DESYNCHRONIZATION THAT CAN BE USED TO PREDICT PROBLEMS AND INTERVENE WHEN NECESSARY. TO DATE, THERE ARE NO BIOMARKERS THAT ARE APPROVED TO DETERMINE INDIVIDUAL ASTRONAUTS  VULNERABILITIES TO SLEEP LOSS AND CIRCADIAN RHYTHM DISRUPTION, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY CANDIDATES TO TEST. IN A RECENT NASA EVIDENCE REVIEW ADDRESSING HRP SLEEP GAP4, WE IDENTIFIED AND EVALUATED APPROXIMATELY 80 POTENTIAL BIOMARKERS OF RESPONSE TO SLEEP LOSS OR CIRCADIAN DESYNCHRONY, RANGING FROM SIMPLE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENTS OF ALERTNESS THROUGH TO GENETIC POLYMORPHISMS. WHILE THERE ARE FEW DATA SPECIFICALLY CHARACTERIZING INDIVIDUAL RESPONSES TO SLEEP LOSS AND CIRCADIAN DESYNCHRONY, FORTUNATELY, MANY OF THESE BIOMARKERS HAVE BEEN STUDIED BY OUR RESEARCH GROUP IN DETAILED LABORATORY CONDITIONS OF THOUSANDS OF SUBJECTS OVER TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BED-DAYS IN FEDERALLY-FUNDED STUDIES, BUT HAVE NEVER BEEN EXAMINED WITH RESPECT TO INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES. FURTHERMORE, IN A PREVIOUS NASA-SUPPORTED STUDY (ROSES-2008), WE STUDIED 51 ANTARCTIC EXPEDITIONERS OVER 6 MONTHS DURING THE ANTARCTIC WINTER (MARCH TO SEPTEMBER) AT AUSTRALIAN ANTARCTIC STATIONS CASEY, DAVIS AND MAWSON (54% OF THE OVERWINTERING POPULATION). A LARGE NUMBER OF SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF STRESS, AFFECT, SAFETY, TEAM INTERACTIONS AND WELL-BEING WERE RECORDED, IN ADDITION TO SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTCOMES INCLUDING SLEEP, CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS, URINARY CORTISOL AND MELATONIN LEVELS, A RANGE OF NEUROCOGNITIVE PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES AND ALERTNESS. THE LARGE DATASET IS AVAILABLE TO TEST THE PREDICTIVE VALUE OF A RANGE OF BEHAVIORAL, PERFORMANCE, SLEEP AND CIRCADIAN BIOMARKERS ON NEUROCOGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND GOING FORWARD, WILL ALLOW OUR RESEARCH TEAM, IN COLLABORATION WITH HRP, TO SELECT ONLY THOSE MEASURES THAT YIELD SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION FOR FUTURE STUDY, AND WILL ALLOW CAPACITY TO ADD NEW MEASURES NOT YET ASSESSED UNDER THESE OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS. BASED ON THIS REVIEW, WE HAVE DEVISED A PROTOCOL TO ASSESS THE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF A CORE SET OF THESE BIOMARKERS TO PREDICT NEUROCOGNITIVE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO THE SLEEP DEPRIVATION AND CIRCADIAN MISALIGNMENT INHERENT IN ISS OPERATIONS. FIRST, WE WILL IDENTIFY CANDIDATE BIOMARKERS FROM OUR LABORATORY ANALOG, WHERE INDIVIDUALS ARE HOUSED IN INDIVIDUAL, SEMI-ISOLATED, WINDOW-LESS SUITES, AND FROM EXISTING EXTENSIVE LONGITUDINAL DATA IN OVER 50 ANTARCTIC EXPEDITIONERS. THESE, AND PREVIOUSLY UNTESTED BIOMARKERS, WILL THEN BE VALIDATED IN NEW LIMITED LABORATORY ANALOG STUDIES TO INFORM A NEW ANALOG STUDY THAT WILL TEST THE FEASIBILITY AND UTILITY OF A SET OF CORE BIOMARKERS TO PREDICT AND ASSESS VARIATION IN NEUROCOGNITIVE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION ASSOCIATED WITH LIVING IN ANTARCTICA DURING A 12-MONTH MISSION.

RECENTLY, WE AND OTHERS HAVE SHOWN THAT SHORT-WAVELENGTH (BLUE) LIGHT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAVELENGTH FOR ENHANCING ALERTNESS AND PERFORMANCE DIRECTLY, AND FOR PHASE-SHIFTING THE CIRCADIAN PACEMAKER. LIGHT THEREFORE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE A SAFE, NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL COUNTERMEASURE TO REDUCE THE RISK OF PERFORMANCE DEFICITS AND CIRCADIAN MISALIGNMENT DURING SPACE FLIGHT.

NASA IS REPLACING THE CURRENT LIGHTING ABOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION WITH A NEW SOLID STATE LIGHTING ASSEMBLY (SSLA), INCORPORATING THREE PRE-DETERMINED SETTINGS TO ADDRESS DIFFERENT OPERATIONAL NEEDS: 1) WHITE LIGHT FOR GENERAL VISION; 2) BLUE-ENRICHED HIGH INTENSITY WHITE LIGHT TO ENHANCE ALERTNESS AND CIRCADIAN ADAPTATION; 3) BLUE-DEPLETED LOW INTENSITY WHITE LIGHT TO MINIMIZE ALERTNESS PRIOR TO SLEEP. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A DYNAMIC LIGHTING SCHEDULE (DLS) WHICH DETERMINES WHEN EACH OF THESE THREE SETTINGS WILL BE USED TO OPTIMIZE LIGHTING TO IMPROVE ALERTNESS AND PERFORMANCE, RESET CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS AND ENHANCE SLEEP, WHILE MAINTAINING VISION.

THESE ADVANTAGES MAKE COMPLIANT MECHANISMS IDEALLY SUITED FOR SPACE OR AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS, WHERE LOW WEIGHT AND NO LUBRICATION ARE ESSENTIAL.

[1] ADVANTAGES OF COMPLIANT MECHANISMS OVER TRADITIONAL MECHANISMS INCLUDE INCREASED PERFORMANCE THROUGH REDUCED WEIGHT, INCREASED PRECISION, REDUCED FRICTION, ELIMINATION OF LUBRICANTS, EASE OF MINIATURIZATION, AND INTEGRATION OF FUNCTIONS INTO FEWER COMPONENTS. MANY CURRENT SPACE MECHANISMS ARE ALREADY HIGHLY OPTIMIZED AND IT IS UNCLEAR IF SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS CAN BE MADE BY MODIFYING CURRENT MECHANISMS.

THESE PROCESSES BUILD UP A PART LAYER BY LAYER, INSTEAD OF REMOVING MATERIAL FROM A LARGE BLOCK AS IN TRADITIONAL MACHINING. SUCH PROCESSES ARE IDEAL FOR LOW QUANTITY PRODUCTION. USING THESE TECHNOLOGIES, ASSEMBLIES CAN BE SIMPLIFIED TO ONE PART IN A MONOLITHIC (MADE FROM A SINGLE SOLID PIECE) DESIGN. ADVANTAGES OF MONOLITHIC DESIGNS INCLUDE SIMPLICITY, ROBUSTNESS, AND LOWER COST. COMPLIANT MECHANISMS DERIVE THEIR MOTION FROM THE FLEXING OF CONSTITUENT MEMBERS. THIS ELIMINATES SLIDING CONTACT IN BEARINGS AND JOINTS, WHICH CAN GREATLY INCREASE RELIABILITY, ESPECIALLY IN SPACE. BECAUSE COMPLIANT MECHANISMS DO NOT RELY ON ASSEMBLED JOINTS, THEY ARE IDEALLY SUITED TO MONOLITHIC DESIGNS. COMBINING ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES WITH COMPLIANT MECHANISM TECHNOLOGY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GREATLY INCREASE PERFORMANCE AND REDUCE COSTS IN SPACE TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS. COMPLIANT MECHANISMS ARE OFTEN DESIGNED TO BE MONOLITHIC, AND USING 3D ADDITIVE MACHINING PROCESSES IS A NATURAL STEP IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLIANT MECHANISM TECHNOLOGY. ADAPTING COMPLIANT MECHANISM DESIGN STRATEGIES FOR MONOLITHIC SPACE TECHNOLOGY CARRIES SOME UNIQUE CHALLENGES THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED IN ORDER TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE TECHNOLOGY. IN THE CONTEXT OF ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES, I WILL ADDRESS TWO MAJOR CHALLENGES: VIBRATION CHARACTERISTICS AND LARGE STRAIN ENERGY. BECAUSE COMPLIANT MECHANISMS ARE FLEXIBLE, THEY OFTEN HAVE LOW NATURAL FREQUENCIES, MAKING THEM SUBJECT TO UNDESIRABLE VIBRATIONS. BY EMPLOYING THE PSEUDO-RIGID-BODY MODEL OF COMPLAINT MECHANISMS IN CONJUNCTION WITH FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS, I BELIEVE WE CAN FIND WAYS TO OPTIMIZE COMPLIANT SPACE MECHANISMS FOR HIGH NATURAL FREQUENCIES WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE NEEDED FLEXIBILITY. AS COMPLIANT MECHANISMS ARE ACTUATED THEY ACT AS SPRINGS, STORING ENERGY AS THE FLEXIBLE MEMBERS DEFLECT. THIS RESULTS IN A NEED FOR LARGER INPUT FORCES TO OVERCOME THE MECHANISM''S INTERNAL STIFFNESS. LARGE ACTUATORS ADD MASS, COMPLEXITY, AND INCREASED POWER CONSUMPTION. STATIC BALANCING HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE FORCE REQUIRED TO ACTUATE COMPLIANT MECHANISMS. USUALLY STATIC BALANCING STRATEGIES REQUIRE SOME ASSEMBLY STEP TO INTRODUCE A PRE-LOAD THAT COMPENSATES FOR ENERGY ADDED DURING ACTUATION. THINK OF AN ARCHITECT''S LAMP AND HOW THE SPRINGS COMPENSATE FOR THE WEIGHT OF THE LAMP. NOW REALIZE THAT ALL THOSE SPRINGS AND LINKS ADD COMPLEXITY AND EXPENSE. FINDING STRATEGIES FOR PRE-LOAD INTRODUCTION WITHOUT DEPARTING FROM MONOLITHIC FABRICATION WILL BE A MAJOR PART OF ENSURING THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. BY EXPLOITING COMPLIANT MECHANISMS IN MONOLITHIC DESIGNS, WE CAN ELIMINATE MUCH OF THAT COMPLEXITY. BY DEVELOPING DESIGN GUIDELINES THAT ADAPT COMPLIANT MECHANISMS TO THE NEEDS OF SPACE TECHNOLOGY I HOPE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NEW ADVANCES IN ADDITIVE METAL MANUFACTURING TO ACHIEVE UNPRECEDENTED PERFORMANCE AND LONGER LIFE. THIS RESEARCH WILL DIRECTLY IMPACT TECHNOLOGY AREA 12.3 (MECHANICAL SYSTEMS), BUT TA13.3 (INCREASED RELIABILITY) AND TA04.3 (ROBOT MANIPULATION) WILL ALSO BENEFIT."

CONVENTIONAL-RESOLUTION SWR RETRIEVAL HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED AT BOTH KU- AND C-BAND. UHR SWR RETRIEVAL HAS BEEN VALIDATED AT KU-BAND, BUT FURTHER VALIDATION AT C-BAND IS NEEDED. CONVENTIONAL-RESOLUTION RAIN FLAGS CAN BENEFIT FROM INFORMATION DERIVED FROM UHR SWR RETRIEVAL.

APPLY THESE CONTROL METHODS TO ACHIEVE UNPRECEDENTED PERFORMANCE IN REAL AND UNMODELED ENVIRONMENTS FOR SOFT ROBOT MANIPULATION AND LOCOMOTION.   TEST THE CONTROLLERS WE DEVELOP IN REALISTIC AND USEFUL SCENARIOS (SUCH AS EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE OR INSTALLATION, OR EXPLORATION OF RUGGED TERRAIN), THAT WILL HAVE WIDE APPLICABILITY TO FUTURE SPACE MISSIONS AS WELL AS OTHER CROSSCUTTING DOMAINS SUCH AS NATURAL DISASTER RELIEF OR SEARCH AND RESCUE MISSIONS. INITIAL TESTS FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS WILL FOCUS ON ROBOT MANIPULATION AND WILL INCLUDE 1) GRASPING UNKNOWN OBJECTS USING A LOW-DEGREEOF- FREEDOM COMPLIANT HAND, AND 2) MANIPULATING UNMODELED COMPLIANT MATERIALS. TESTS IN THE THIRD YEAR WILL FOCUS ON APPLYING OUR NEW LOW-LEVEL SOFT ROBOT CONTROLLERS TO 1) PERFORM LOCOMOTION OVER ROUGH TERRAIN WITH A SOFT ROBOT QUADRUPED PLATFORM AND 2) PERFORM TASKS THAT REQUIRE MANIPULATION AND LOCOMOTION SIMULTANEOUSLY. OUR INITIAL APPROACH FOR CONTROL, WHICH IS CALLED MPC, USES AN EXPLICIT MODEL OF THE UNDERDAMPED AND UNDERACTUATED DYNAMICS AND SHOULD ALLOW FOR SMOOTH, CONTROLLED MOTION, WHILE ALSO FACILITATING THE ABILITY TO LEVERAGE THE UNDERDAMPED NATURE OF THE SYSTEM. THESE EXPECTATIONS COME FROM RESULTS OF OUR PRIOR WORK WITH MPC. OUR PROPOSED WORK WILL SIGNIFICANTLY EXTEND RESEARCH WHERE WE HAD DEVELOPED CONTROLLERS FOR RIGID ROBOTS WITH COMPLIANCE AT THE JOINTS AND TACTILE SENSING (SEE HTTP://YOUTU.BE/T8SZ-CO1ORE AND HTTP:// YOUTU.BE/OTPWNZ2GPPG). MPC ALSO ALLOWS THE DEFINITION OF HARD CONSTRAINTS, SUCH AS ACTUATOR OR JOINT LIMITS. THIS MEANS THAT IN ADDITION TO THE NATURAL ROBUSTNESS OF SOFT ROBOTS TO UNMODELED CONTACT, WE CAN ALSO EXPLICITLY DEFINE ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS FOR OUR ROBOT SUCH AS PROXIMITY TO PEOPLE OR MAXIMUM CONTACT FORCE.

WITH AN ANNOUNCED PHOBOS SAMPLE RETURN  MISSION AND INTEREST IN USING PHOBOS AS A BASE FROM WHICH TO EXPLORE MARS, THE POTENTIAL FOR VIABLE  MICROBES ON PHOBOS WOULD PRESENT COMPELLING ASTROBIOLOGICAL INTEREST BUT ALSO A SIGNIFICANT AND  URGENT PLANETARY PROTECTION CONCERN.  THE TRANSIT OF MICROBES FROM MARS TO PHOBOS WOULD NECESSARILY INVOLVE A HIGH-VELOCITY IMPACT ON THE  PHOBOS SURFACE. NUMEROUS  STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT MICROORGANISMS, PARTICULARLY BACTERIAL  SPORES, SURVIVE UNUSUALLY HIGH SHOCK PRESSURES AND OTHER HARSH CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, THESE  EXPERIMENTS DO NOT CONSTRAIN THE SURVIVABILITY OF INDIVIDUAL MICROBES AS THEY IMPACT A SOLID  SURFACE AT THESE SPEEDS.  WE HAVE DEVELOPED A UNIQUE MICROBE ACCELERATOR THAT IS ABLE TO APPROXIMATE THESE CONDITIONS. WE  PROPOSE A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS TO CHARACTERIZE THE SURVIVABILITY OF SEVERAL TYPES OF MICROBES IN  IMPACTS UP TO 1 KM/S WITH SOLID SURFACES, INCLUDING PHOBOS REGOLITH SIMULANT. ADDITIONAL  EXPERIMENTS WILL CHARACTERIZE THE ELASTICITY OF MICROBES DURING IMPACTS AND THE RESULTING  IMPLICATIONS FOR DISPERSAL.  IN THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENTS, MICROBES ARE CHARGED USING ELECTROSPRAY, INTRODUCED INTO VACUUM, AND  AERODYNAMICALLY ACCELERATED TO THE DESIRED VELOCITY. IMAGE CHARGE DETECTION IS USED TO MEASURE THE  VELOCITY OF EACH IMPACTING MICROBE. AFTER A SUITABLE NUMBER OF MICROBES HAVE IMPACTED UNDER ONE SET OF CONDITIONS, THE CANISTER CONTAINING THE IMPACT TARGET IS  REMOVED FOR ANALYSIS. THIS ACCELERATOR CAN EXPLORE A WIDE RANGE OF ORGANISMS AND IMPACT CONDITIONS.  NOT ONLY DOES THIS APPROACH OVERCOME THE TIME AND COST LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING METHODS FOR SHOCK SURVIVABILITY EXPERIMENTS, BUT DIRECT IMPACT OF A SPORE ON A SURFACE  IS PHYSICALLY A VERY DIFFERENT PHENOMENON THAN SHOCK TRANSMITTED TO A MICROBE THROUGH A SOLID OR  LIQUID MATRIX.

NECESSARY SYSTEM ELECTRONICS, SENSITIVE SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS AND ESPECIALLY ASTRONAUTS ONBOARD THE SPACECRAFT MUST OPERATE WITHIN A SPECIFIC TEMPERATURE WINDOW OR THE MISSION WILL FAIL. HOWEVER, THE TENDENCY OF A SPACECRAFT''S TEMPERATURE IS TO INCREASE. THE SUN AND THE EARTH RADIATE HEAT THAT IS ABSORBED INTO THE SPACECRAFT WHILE ON BOARD ELECTRONICS AND PERSONNEL GENERATE HEAT INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT. ON EARTH, THIS EXCESS HEAT WOULD NORMALLY BE REMOVED BY AIR AROUND THE SPACECRAFT. HOWEVER, THE SPACECRAFT IS IN THE VACUUM OF SPACE. AS SUCH, THE HEAT MUST ULTIMATELY BE EMITTED AWAY FROM THE SPACECRAFT AS RADIATION. COMPONENTS DESIGNED TO EMIT THIS EXCESS HEAT ARE CALLED RADIATORS AND ARE A VITAL PART OF THE THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OF ANY SPACECRAFT. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE HEAT LOAD ON A SYSTEM VARIES WITH ORBIT, RADIATORS ARE DESIGNED FOR A WORST CASE HEATING SCENARIO. AS SUCH, ANY HEATING CONFIGURATION OUTSIDE OF THE DESIGNED HEATING SCENARIO CAUSES THE RADIATOR TO BEHAVE IN AN UNDESIRABLE WAY, EMITTING MORE HEAT THAN DESIRED OR ABSORBING TOO MUCH HEAT FROM THE SURROUNDINGS. LIKEWISE, THESE RADIATORS ARE HEAVY, OFTEN COMPRISING 30 - 40 PERCENT OF TOTAL SPACECRAFT WEIGHT. A SIMPLE YET EFFECTIVE SOLUTION, AS DISCUSSED IN THE THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ROADMAP, IS TO DEVELOP A LIGHTWEIGHT RADIATOR WHICH IS ABLE TO MANIPULATE ITS HEAT REJECTION RATE IN REAL TIME.  THIS PROPOSAL DISCUSSES A LIGHT WEIGHT, VARIABLE HEAT REJECTION TECHNOLOGY THAT MAY BE UTILIZED IN MANY APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING THAT OF A DEEP SPACE RADIATOR. A THIN, MIRROR FINISH ALUMINUM FOIL IS FOLDED INTO A SIMPLE, ORIGAMI INSPIRED V GROOVE PATTERN. THIS PATTERN ALLOWS FOR THE FOIL TO BE COMPRESSED, SUCH THAT THE V GROOVES ARE VERY STEEP AND TIGHTLY COMPACTED, OR STRETCHED UNTIL IT RESEMBLES A FLAT SHEET.  AS THE FOIL IS COMPRESSED, THE AMOUNT OF HEAT RADIATED INTO SPACE OR THE AMOUNT OF HEAT ABSORBED IS GREATLY INCREASED. WHEN PULLED FLAT, THE FOIL WILL EMIT AND ABSORB VERY LITTLE RADIATION. THIS VARIABLE HEAT REJECTION CAPABILITY IS USEFUL FOR BOTH RADIATOR AND HEAT SHIELD APPLICATIONS. AS A RADIATOR, THE FOIL WILL GIVE THE USER CONTROL OF HOW MUCH HEAT IS ENTERING OR LEAVING THE SYSTEM. THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY RADIATOR WEIGHT WHILE DELIVERING OPTIMUM HEAT REJECTION PERFORMANCE FOR THE ENTIRE MISSION DURATION. LIKEWISE, THESE FOILS MAY BE USED AS HEAT SHIELDS, PLACED OVER COMPONENTS SENSITIVE TO TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS, SUCH AS CRYOGENIC FLUID TANKS.  WHEN ILLUMINATED BY THE SUN, THE SHIELD CAN ASSUME A FLAT STATE, REFLECTING 98 PERCENT OF THE SUN''S ENERGY AWAY FROM THE SENSITIVE COMPONENT.  UPON ENTERING THE EARTH''S SHADOW, THE SHIELD WILL ASSUME A COMPRESSED STATE, EMITTING EXCESS HEAT ORIGINATING FROM THE SPACECRAFT INTO DEEP SPACE INSTEAD OF REFLECTING THIS HEAT ONTO THE CRYOGENIC FLUID TANK. PRELIMINARY WORK CHARACTERIZING THE BEHAVIOR OF V GROOVES WHEN EXPOSED TO RADIATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED. HOWEVER, THE BULK OF THE WORK REMAINS. THE TOTAL HEAT REJECTED FROM A FOIL SAMPLE, ACCOUNTING FOR EMITTING SURFACE AREA, MUST BE CHARACTERIZED. LIKEWISE, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FOIL AND THE SURFACE IT IS PROTECTING MUST BE DETERMINED. NEXT, AN ACTUATION SYSTEM AND FIXATION COMPONENTS MUST BE DEVELOPED. FINALLY, THE COMPLETE THERMAL SYSTEM MUST BE MODELED AND EXPERIMENTALLY PROVEN CAPABLE OF MAINTAINING THE TEMPERATURE OF A PROTECTED SURFACE UNDER VARYING HEAT LOADS. ULTIMATELY, THE PURPOSE OF THIS WORK IS TO MODEL A COMPLETE THERMAL SYSTEM INVOLVING THE USE OF A VARIABLE HEAT REJECTION SHIELD, DEVELOP THIS TECHNOLOGY TO A SPACE READY STATE AND EXPERIMENTALLY VALIDATE ITS ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE TEMPERATURE OF A PROTECTED SURFACE WHEN EXPOSED TO VARYING HEAT LOADS."

AT THE GLOBAL SCALE, OMEGA VISIBLE AND NEAR INFRARED SPECTRAL MAPPING REVEALED THAT PHYLLOSILICATES ARE MOST COMMONLY OBSERVED IN THE OLDEST, NOACHIAN-AGED ROCKS, AND THAT HYDRATED SULFATES ARE GENERALLY DETECTED IN RELATIVELY YOUNGER HESPERIAN-AGED UNITS. AS PHYLLOSILICATES TYPICALLY FORM UNDER CIRCUMNEUTRAL GEOCHEMICAL CONDITIONS AT HIGH WATER TO ROCK RATIOS, THEY ARE MINERALOGIC INDICATORS FOR WETTER CONDITIONS. HYDROLOGIC MODELING SUGGESTS THAT THE MARTIAN HYDROLOGIC CYCLE WAS DOMINATED BY GROUND WATER INTERACTIONS BY THE LATE HESPERIAN, WHICH RESULTED IN THE CEMENTATION OF PREDOMINATELY AEOLIAN-DERIVED EVAPORITIC DEPOSITS THAT FORMED AT LOW WATER TO ROCK RATIOS. WHILE THE GLOBAL PROSPECTIVE OF MARTIAN AQUEOUS HISTORY IS ONE OF EVOLUTION FROM RELATIVELY WETTER CONDITIONS IN THE NOACHIAN TO A HYPER ARID ENVIRONMENT BY THE END OF THE HESPERIAN, THE NATURE OF THE TRANSITION BETWEEN THESE TWO REGIMES IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. REGIONAL AND LOCAL STUDIES OF DEPOSITS THAT FORMED DURING THE NOACHIAN/HESPERIAN TRANSITION USING THE HIGHEST RESOLUTION DATA ARE REVEALING EVIDENCE FOR COMPLEX DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENTS THAT EXHIBIT A VARIETY OF GEOMORPHIC FEATURES AND ALTERATION MINERALS INDICATIVE OF MULTIPLE GEOCHEMICAL REGIMES. THE PROPOSED WORK SEEKS TO ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF AQUEOUS-DRIVEN SEDIMENTARY AND ALTERATION PROCESSES THAT OPERATED ON MARS AT THE REGIONAL AND LOCAL SCALES BY PERFORMING DETAILED STRATIGRAPHIC MAPPING AND MINERALOGIC ANALYSES OF WELL EXPOSED SEDIMENTARY DEPOSITS IN EASTERN SINUS MERIDIANI USING MRO HIRISE (25 CM/PIXEL), CTX (5 M/PIXEL), AND CRISM (20 M/PIXEL) DATA IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER ORBITAL DATASETS.

WE PROPOSE TO (1) DETERMINE THE REGIONAL STRATIGRAPHY IN EASTERN SINUS MERIDIANI (0E TO 8E, -2N TO 4N), (2) DETERMINE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN STRATIGRAPHY AND ALTERATION MINERALOGY TO INFER REGIONAL DEPOSITIONAL AND/OR ALTERATION PROCESSES, (3) PERFORM DETAILED STRATIGRAPHIC AND SPECTRAL MAPPING USING THE HIGHEST SPATIAL RESOLUTION DATA TO FURTHER CHARACTERIZE AQUEOUS PROCESSES FOR AT LEAST FOUR SUBREGIONS, AND (4) INTEGRATE THE REGIONAL AND LOCAL STUDIES TO CHARACTERIZE NOACHIAN/HESPERIAN AQUEOUS-DRIVEN SEDIMENTARY AND ALTERATION PROCESSES THATOPERATED IN EASTERN SINUS MERIDIANI, MARS."

THESE MODELS PREDICT THAT WATER TRANSPORT AWAY FROM THE POLES IS IN QUANTITIES SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE SIGNIFICANT MID-LATITUDE ICE ACCUMULATION (THICKNESSES OF MANY HUNDREDS OF METERS) OVER GREAT AREAL EXTENT (HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF KM2). ARE THESE PREDICTIONS CORRECT?  ANALYSIS AND INVENTORY OF NORTHERN MID-LATITUDE LOBATE DEBRIS APRONS AND LINEATED VALLEY FILL DEPOSITS (LDA/LVF) HAVE LED TO  HYPOTHESES THAT LDA/LVF ARE RELATED TO SUCH CHANGES IN CLIMATIC CONDITIONS (DEPOSITION OF WATER VAPOR, SNOW AND ICE) BUT OPINIONS DIFFER ON THE RELATIVE AMOUNTS OF ICE/DEBRIS INVOLVED AND THE PROCESSES OF EMPLACEMENT OF LDA/LVF. AMONG THE MULTIPLE WORKING HYPOTHESES ARE: 1) MOBILIZATION AND FLOW OF GROUND ICE; 2) VAPOR DIFFUSION INTO TALUS LEADING TO CREEP AND ROCK GLACIERS; 3) DEPOSITION OF SNOW AND ICE IN DICHOTOMY BOUNDARY ALCOVES AND FORMATION OF ALPINE-LIKE DEBRIS-COVERED GLACIAL LANDSYSTEMS. ANALYSIS OF THESE MULTIPLE WORKING HYPOTHESES TO DATE SHOWS THAT THE ALPINE DEBRIS-COVERED GLACIAL LANDSYSTEM END-MEMBER MODEL IS CONSISTENT WITH A VARIETY OF AVAILABLE DATA, BUT THAT EVEN THIS END-MEMBER MODEL FALLS FAR SHORT OF THE AMOUNTS AND AREAL EXTENTS OF ICE PREDICTED BY ATMOSPHERIC GENERAL CIRCULATION MODELS (GCM) AND GLACIAL FLOW MODELS. THESE OBSERVATIONS RAISE TWO QUESTIONS: 1) ARE THE LDA/LVF PROPERLY INTERPRETED AS ALPINE-TYPE DEBRIS-COVERED GLACIERS, OR ARE OTHER MECHANISMS AND PROCESSES MORE APPLICABLE? 2) IS THERE GEOLOGIC EVIDENCE IN THE AREAS PROXIMAL AND DISTAL TO THE LDA/LVF THAT MIGHT SUPPORT THE FORMER PRESENCE OF MUCH MORE WIDESPREAD SNOW AND ICE DEPOSIT FORMED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LDA/LVF AS PREDICTED BY GCM AND GLACIAL FLOW MODELS? WE PROPOSE TWO OBJECTIVES TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS: 1) TEST FURTHER THE MULTIPLE WORKING HYPOTHESIS MODELS FOR THE FORMATION OF LDA/LVF AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE ALPINE DEBRIS-COVERED GLACIER MODEL. 2) ASSESS THE REGIONS SURROUNDING THE LDA/LVF FOR ANY EVIDENCE THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF SNOW AND ICE MAY HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE IN THE PAST, AS PREDICTED BY GCM AND GLACIAL FLOW MODELS. WE FORMULATE TWO TASKS TO ACCOMPLISH THESE OBJECTIVES: IN TASK 1 (ASSESSMENT AND ORIGIN(S) OF PLATEAU DEPOSITS LYING ABOVE THE LDA/LVF) WE PROPOSE AN ANALYSIS TO TEST THE PREDICTIONS OF THE REGIONAL ICE SHEET MODEL BY EXAMINING EVIDENCE IN THE NORTHERN DICHOTOMY BOUNDARY REGION FOR FORMER ICE COVER FROM THE NATURE OF SUPERPOSED IMPACT CRATER DEPOSITS, PLATEAU MARGINS, AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF LOCAL SINUOUS CHANNELS. IN TASK 2 (ASSESSMENT AND ORIGIN(S) OF DEPOSITS DISTAL TO LDA/LVF) WE PROPOSE AN ANALYSIS OF THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF DEPOSITS THAT SURROUND AND LIE IMMEDIATELY NORTHWARD OF THE LDA/LVF IN THE NORTHERN DICHOTOMY BOUNDARY REGION, AND AN ASSESSMENT OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO OCCURRENCES OF CONCENTRIC CRATER FILL (CCF) IN THIS AREA. THE RESULTS OF BOTH OF THESE TASKS WILL THEN SET THE STAGE FOR FUTURE CONSTRAINTS ON: 1) ATMOSPHERIC GENERAL CIRCULATION MODELS, 2) GLACIAL FLOW MODELS, 3) GLOBAL WATER INVENTORIES, AND 4) THE MAPPING OF WATER TRANSPORT PATHWAYS DURING PERIODS OF AMAZONIAN CLIMATE CHANGE. TOGETHER, THESE ANALYSES WILL USE MULTIPLE WORKING HYPOTHESES TO ASSESS THE ORIGIN, EXTENT AND EVOLUTION OF CLIMATE-RELATED WATER-ICE-RICH DEPOSITS IN THE MID-LATITUDES (LDA/LVF/CCF), DEPOSITS THAT ARE VERY ACCESSIBLE TO FUTURE ROBOTIC AND HUMAN EXPLORATION."

THESE ARE ALL BASINS THAT APPEAR TO HAVE EXCAVATED DEEPLY INTO THE LUNAR CRUST BASED ON EXISTING GEOPHYSICAL DATA. PRIMARY COMPOSITIONAL ANALYSES WILL BE BASED ON M3 GLOBAL DATA BECAUSE IT PROVIDES COMPOSITIONAL INFORMATION AT THE HIGHEST SPATIAL RESOLUTION (#tilde#140 M/PIXEL). THESE WILL BE INTEGRATED WITH DATA FROM LUNAR PROSPECTOR, KAGUYA, AND LRO. DATA ANALYSIS ACTIVITIES BUILD ON SUCCESSFUL EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH M3 DATA. REFLECTANCE DATA WILL BE PREPARED FROM M3 INDIVIDUAL DATA SWATHS AND RELEVANT MOSAICS WILL BE GENERATED.

WHERE THE DATA ARE OF SUFFICIENT QUALITY, MORE ADVANCED TOOLS (E.G., MGM) WILL ALSO BE USED TO EVALUATE COMPOSITION. KEY ASPECTS OF THESE ANALYSES INCLUDE: IDENTIFYING THE MINERALS PRESENT, IDENTIFYING THE SPATIAL SCALE OF SPECIFIC LITHOLOGIES AND MAPPING THEIR EXTENT, CHARACTERIZING THE COMPOSITION OF KEY MINERALS (E.G. MG#), IDENTIFYING LITHOLOGIES THAT OCCUR TOGETHER OR NEARBY, ASSESS THE REGIONAL OCCURRENCE AND RELATION TO THE ASSOCIATED IMPACT EVENT (BASIN), COMPARE REGIONAL AND GLOBAL COMPOSITIONAL RESULTS.

MINERALOGIC DATA SUGGEST A TRANSITION FROM PHYLLOSILICATE FORMATION AND CIRCUM-NEUTRAL PH AQUEOUS PROCESSES TO A MORE ACIDIC, WATER-LIMITED SULFATEFORMING ERA KEY TO DISCERNING THE NATURE AND CAUSES OF OBSERVED ENVIRONMENTAL TRANSITIONS ON EARLY MARS IS THE CHARACTERIZATION OF CONTINUOUS STRATIGRAPHIC SECTIONS WITH ROCK UNITS THAT SPAN THIS CRITICAL TIME INTERVAL.

WHAT IS THE DIVERSITY OF CARBONATE MINERALOGY ACROSS THE REGION AND WHAT OTHER MINERALS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DEPOSITS? DOES CARBONATE SPECTRAL PROPERTIES VARY WITH GEOLOGIC SETTING (E.G. HIGHLAND REGIONS VS LOWER ELEVATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OUTFLOW SYSTEMS)? WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE SULFATEBEARING DEPOSITS (EHLMANN AND MUSTARD, 2012) AND HOW EXTENSIVE ARE THEY? DO THEY REPRESENT FUNDAMENTAL ALTERATION OF VOLCANIC ROCKS, UPWELLING OF SUBSURFACE BRINES (E.G. ANDREWS-HANNA ET AL) OR ANOTHER PROCESS?

WE OUTLINE THE THEMES AND TOPICS FOR LOLA DATA ACQUISITION, DOCUMENTATION AND VALIDATION AND DESCRIBE A SET OF EXPECTED ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND DELIVERABLES IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS PARTICIPATION IN THIS AND SIMILAR EXPERIMENTS (E.G., SMITH ET AL., 1998, 1999, 2001, 2010; KRESLAVSKY AND HEAD, 1999, 2000; ZUBER ET AL, 1998, 2000). A VALIDATION PROJECT IS DEFINED AS A SPECIFIC TASK THAT DEMONSTRATES TO THE ENGINEERING AND SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY THE USEFULNESS AND CAPABILITIES OF THE DATA AS APPLIED TO A PARTICULAR FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM (E.G., PAST AND PRESENT LANDING SITE CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES FOR APPLICATION TO THE MOON, ASTEROIDS, MARS; TOPOGRAPHIC CHARACTERIZATION OF LANDFORMS, SUCH AS CRATERS, TO ASSIST IN THE DESIGN OF FUTURE ALTIMETERS AND RELATED INSTRUMENTATION; SLOPE AND ROUGHNESS CHARACTERIZATION FOR FUTURE LUNAR AND PLANETARY RESOURCE UTILIZATION; MECHANISMS FOR THE DOCUMENTATION AND DETECTION OF VOLATILES IN PERMANENTLY SHADOWED AREAS) (E.G., FASSETT ET AL., 2011A,B,2012A,B; BAKER ET AL., 2011A,B, 2012; HEAD ET AL., 2010; HURWITZ ET AL., 2012, 2013;JOZWIAK ET AL., 2012; KADISH ET AL, 2011; VAUGHAN ET AL., 2013, KRESLAVSKY ET AL., 2012,2013; ZUBER ET AL., 2012). VALIDATION PROJECT DELIVERABLES TAKE THE FORM OF 1) PAPERS PUBLISHED IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE, AND 2) DATA PLACED IN THE PLANETARY DATA SYSTEM AND ON INTERNET ARCHIVES (E.G., HTTP://WWW.PLANETARY.BROWN.EDU/HTML_PAGES/DATA.HTM).

THESE IMPACT GLASSES ARE SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE RECENT WORK HAS DEMONSTRATED THEIR ABILITY TO ENCAPSULATE COMPLEX  ORGANIC MATTER, PRESERVING IT FOR BILLIONS OF YEARS ON THE MARTIAN SURFACE. THUS IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THIS MATERIAL AT  BOTH ROVER AND ORBITAL SCALES. WE PROPOSE TO SYNTHESIZE MARTIAN-COMPOSITION BASALTIC AND ULTRAMAFIC QUENCHED GLASSES, INVESTIGATE  THEIR SPECTRAL PROPERTIES AT VISIBLE AND INFRARED WAVELENGTHS, AND INTEGRATE THESE DATA WITH EXISTING SPACECRAFT SPECTRA OF THE MARTIAN  SURFACE. THE KEY OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO: (1) CREATE QUENCHED GLASSES OF SYNTHESIZED BASALTIC AND ULTRAMAFIC POWDERS WITH  COMPOSITIONS CONSISTENT WITH QUANTITATIVE ELEMENTAL MEASUREMENTS OF MARTIAN METEORITES AND ROVER OBSERVATIONS, UNDER CONDITIONS  THAT APPROXIMATE NEAR-SURFACE CONDITIONS ON MARS RELEVANT TO THE IMPACT MELTING PROCESS, (2) CHARACTERIZE THESE QUENCHED `IMPACT   GLASSES WITH VISIBLE TO MID-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY TO DETERMINE THEIR SPECTRAL PROPERTIES AND DETECTION LIMITS, AND (3) USE THIS SPECTRAL  LIBRARY OF MARS-COMPOSITION GLASSES TO EVALUATE ORBITAL SPACECRAFT SPECTRA OF SUSPECTED GLASSY IMPACT MELTS PROXIMAL TO IMPACT CRATERS  ON THE SURFACE. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES WE WILL CREATE A SUITE OF SYNTHETIC POWDERS BASED ON ACTUAL MARTIAN COMPOSITIONS. THESE  POWDERS WILL BE MELTED AND INSTANTLY DROP QUENCHED IN A VERTICAL FURNACE, CAREFULLY CONTROLLING FOR OXYGEN FUGACITY. ALL SYNTHESIZED  GLASSES WILL BE MEASURED WITH REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY AT VISIBLE NEAR-INFRARED WAVELENGTHS, AND THERMAL EMISSION SPECTROSCOPY IN  THE MID INFRARED. WITH THESE MEASUREMENTS WE WILL QUANTITATIVELY DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF COMPOSITION AND OXYGEN FUGACITY ON THE  SPECTRAL PROPERTIES OF THE GLASSES. THESE MEASUREMENTS WILL ALLOW DIRECT COMPARISON WITH ORBITAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDING THE NASA  COMPACT IMAGING SPECTROMETER FOR MARS (CRISM) AND THE NASA THERMAL EMISSION SPECTROMETER (TES), PROVIDING AN INVALUABLE  LIBRARY OF LABORATORY SPECTRA FOR FUTURE STUDIES. THE ABILITY OF QUENCHED IMPACT MELTS TO CONCENTRATE AND PRESERVE BIOSIGNATURES IS  RELEVANT TO MANY NASA OBJECTIVES CENTERED ON THE SEARCH FOR SIGNS OF LIFE ON OTHER PLANETARY BODIES, SO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT CRITERIA ARE  ESTABLISHED TO PROPERLY IDENTIFY THESE MATERIALS WITH SPECTROMETERS ON ROVERS AND ORBITERS. EVALUATING PROCESSES AND ENVIRONMENTS THAT  CAN PRESERVE BIOSIGNATURES ON THE SURFACE IS HIGHLIGHTED AS A CRITICAL NEED BY MEPAG REPORTS AND THE NASA MARS 2020 ROVER SCIENCE  DEFINITION REPORT. THE PERCEIVED IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS NOT LIMITED TO MARS, AS IMPACT-GENERATED GLASSES ARE LIKELY COMMON  ON ALL ROCKY SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES, INCLUDING THE MOON. OUR RESULTS WILL ALLOW FOR PROPER CHARACTERIZATION OF THESE MATERIALS, OFFERING  INSIGHT INTO THE EARLY BOMBARDMENT OF THE TERRESTRIAL PLANETS."

THE SILICATE ''MAGMA OCEANS'' SOLIDIFY AS THE PLANETS COOL, LEAVING CHEMICALLY DIFFERENTIATED, HETEROGENEOUS INTERIORS. SUBSEQUENT TO MAGMA OCEAN SOLIDIFICATION, THE INTERIORS OF SMALL ROCKY BODIES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM, LIKE THE MOON, APPEAR NOT TO HAVE UNDERGONE EXTENSIVE CONVECTIVE MIXING. BECAUSE OF THIS, THEIR INITIAL CHEMICAL STRATIFICATION STRONGLY GOVERNS THEIR SUBSEQUENT EVOLUTION. THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE FROM THE MESSENGER MISSION THAT MERCURY''S INTERIOR IS HETEROGENEOUS, AND POSSIBLY LAYERED, SUGGESTING IT IS A REMNANT OF ITS INITIAL SOLIDIFICATION FROM A MAGMA OCEAN (MMO). THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO CONSTRAIN HOW THIS SOLIDIFICATION TOOK PLACE, AND TO COMPARE IT TO MODELS FOR ITS CURRENT COMPOSITIONAL HETEROGENEITY. THE FIRST PHASE OF THE STUDY WILL USE HIGH PRESSURE EXPERIMENTS TO DETERMINE THE CRYSTALLIZATION SEQUENCE OF A MODEL MMO COMPOSITION UNDER THE HIGHLY REDUCING CONDITIONS AND HIGH S CONTENTS, THOUGHT TO BE RELEVANT TO MERCURY. THIS PART OF THE STUDY WILL DETERMINE WHAT PHASES WILL CRYSTALLIZE FROM THE MAGMA OCEAN AND WHAT THEIR COMPOSITIONS ARE. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE THE FINAL COMPOSITIONAL LAYERING WITHIN THE SOLIDIFIED MMO BECAUSE 1) THE CRYSTALS WILL, IN GENERAL, NOT BE THE SAME DENSITY AS THE MAGMA AND WILL SINK OR FLOAT, AND 2) THE MMO WILL BE CONVECTING, WHICH WILL TEND TO RESIST CRYSTAL SEGREGATION. THUS, THE SECOND PHASE OF THE STUDY WILL USE THE PHASE EQUILIBRIA DATA TO CONSTRUCT A NUMERICAL MODEL OF CRYSTAL SEGREGATION IN A CONVECTING MAGMA OCEAN. THE RESULT WILL BE A CHEMICALLY AND PHYSICALLY CONSISTENT ESTIMATE OF THE CHEMICAL STRATIFICATION OF MERCURY''S MANTLE JUST AFTER MMO SOLIDIFICATION. THIS STRATIFICATION IS A FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTY OF THE PLANET AND GOVERNED ITS SUBSEQUENT CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL EVOLUTION. TWO ASPECTS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST ARE: 1) TO WHAT DEGREE DO SULFIDE LAYERS DEVELOP DURING SOLIDIFICATION AND 2) TO WHAT DEGREE DO THESE SULFIDE LAYERS CONCENTRATE THE HEAT PRODUCING ELEMENTS U, TH AND K. HIGH-PRESSURE EXPERIMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED IN THE BROWN UNIVERSITY HIGH-PRESSURE LABORATORY USING A RANGE OF GAS AND SOLID PRESSURE MEDIA DEVICES. PRESSURE, TEMPERATURE AND OXYGEN FUGACITY WILL BE VARIED TO COVER THE RANGE OF CONDITIONS THOUGHT TO EXIST WITHIN MERCURY. BOTH EQUILIBRIA AND FRACTIONAL CRYSTALLIZATION EXPERIMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED. TRACE ELEMENTS WILL BE ADDED TO THE EXPERIMENTS TO DETERMINE THE PARTITIONING OF HEAT PRODUCING ELEMENTS (U, K AND TH) BETWEEN PHASES. EXPERIMENTAL PRODUCTS WILL BE ANALYZED AT BROWN BY ELECTRON MICROPROBE FOR MAJOR AND MINOR ELEMENTS, AND BY LASER-ABLATION INDUCTIVELY-COUPLED MASS SPECTROMETRY FOR TRACE ELEMENTS. THE NUMERICAL MODELS WILL BE BASED ON PREVIOUS MODELS DEVELOPED AT BROWN UNIVERSITY FOR LUNAR MAGMA OCEAN CRYSTALLIZATION, BUT WILL INCLUDE NEW THEORETICAL WORK ON THE PHYSICS OF CRYSTAL SEGREGATION. IN EACH TIME STEP OF THE MODEL, THE PHASE EQUILIBRIA WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE WHAT PHASES CRYSTALLIZE AND THEIR COMPOSITIONS.

THE RECENT DISCOVERY OF PLUMES ERUPTING FROM EUROPA S SOUTH POLE REVEALS NOT ONLY THAT THE MOON IS MORE GEOLOGICALLY ACTIVE THAN EXPECTED, BUT THAT THE THEORETICAL MODELS IMPLYING THE MOON S QUIESCENCE ARE INACCURATE -AN INACCURACY PREDICATED SPECIFICALLY ON A LACK OF EXTRAPOLATIVE MODELS OF VISCOELASTICITY (CREEP AND ATTENUATION, COMBINED) IN POLYCRYSTALLINE ICE-I. PRESENT RHEOLOGICAL EXTRAPOLATIONS FOR ATTENUATION ARE PREDICATED ON A MODEL  SPECIFICALLY DIFFUSIONAL CREEP GIVING RISE TO A SIMPLE MAXWELL VISCOSITY, WHICH LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED AS CLEARLY INAPPROPRIATE. SOUND, DEFENSIBLE EXTRAPOLATIONS CAN ONLY BE DONE FROM EXPERIMENTS PROBING THE SAME PHYSICAL MECHANISMS OPERATIVE WITHIN AN ICY SATELLITE. WE PROPOSE A UNIQUE EXPERIMENTAL/THEORETICAL STUDY SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS THIS NEED. ENGINEERED ICE- I SPECIMENS OF CONTROLLED GRAIN SIZE AND IMPURITY CONTENT WILL BE SUBJECTED TO SIMULTANEOUS LOADING FOR STEADY-STATE CREEP (CONSTANT MEAN DIFFERENTIAL STRESS, #tilde#0.5MPA) AND ATTENUATION (SINUSOID ABOUT THE MEAN STRESS, #tilde# 0.05MPA AND 1E-4<(HZ)<1) AT 200<T(K)<255). THESE ARE CONDITIONS CONSISTENT WITH PLANETARY ICE PHYSICS AS PRESENTLY UNDERSTOOD, WITH A RHEOLOGY WHEREBY LATTICE DISLOCATIONS AND DIFFUSION-AFFECTED GRAIN BOUNDARY SLIDING BOTH CONTRIBUTE TO EFFECTIVE VISCOSITY AND ATTENUATION. DEFORMED SPECIMENS WILL BE EVALUATED MICROSTRUCTURALLY VIA DIFFERENTIAL INTERFERENCE CONTRAST (NOMARSKI) OPTICAL MICROSCOPY. THEORETICALLY, THERE ARE TWO THRUSTS: (1) APPLICATION OF EQUATION-OF-STATE RHEOLOGY THEORY TO ATTENUATION AND (2) PARAMETERIZATION OF A VISCOELASTIC RHEOLOGY, CONSISTENT WITH THAT DISCERNED IN THESE EXPERIMENTS, THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO MODELS OF ENERGY BUDGET AND DEFORMATION ON ICY SATELLITES. IMPURITY CONTENT WILL EMPHASIZE SALTS (SULFATE AND AMMONIUM, PRIMARILY), PARTICULARLY INCLUDING SECOND PHASES OF SALT HYDRATES. THE EXPERIMENTS ADDITIONALLY ALLOW CHARACTERIZATION OF TRANSIENT CREEP RESPONSES TO SIGNIFICANT STAINS (I.E.,>0.01), I.E., THOSE THAT AFFECT MICROSTRUCTURAL CHANGES IN THE RESISTANCE TO FLOW; THESE DATA CAN BE USED TO ADDRESS THE PHYSICS OF SURFACE RELAXATION ON THE SATELLITES. STATEMENT OF THE PERCEIVED SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED WORK TO THE OBJECTIVES OF THE SOLICITATION AND TO NASA INTERESTS AND PROGRAMS IN GENERAL: THE MISSION TO EUROPA WILL BE ABLE TO MONITOR THE SATELLITE''S GEOID, BUT HOW IS THAT TURNED IN TO AN ENERGY BUDGET? PRESENT COMPREHENSION OF MECHANICAL RESPONSE OF ICE IS RAPIDLY CHANGING, AND THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSES WILL BE CRUCIAL TO THE APPROPRIATE INTERPRETATION OF MISSION DATA. MORE GENERALLY, THE PROPOSED WORK IS DISTINCTLY RELEVANT TO THE NASA SOLAR SYSTEMS WORKINGS PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY IN THAT THE CALL  SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROCESSES THAT AFFECT THE SURFACES, INTERIORS,   OF PLANETARY BODIES,  AND PARTICULARLY  LABORATORY AND THEORETICAL STUDIES  GEARED TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING  INTERNAL STRUCTURE, CHEMISTRY AND DYNAMICS  OF SOLAR-SYSTEM BODIES."

THE SEQUENCES CONTAIN AN UNPRECEDENTED METEORITE IMPACT RECORD AS WELL AS ABUNDANT FOSSIL ASSEMBLAGES. THE POTENTIAL FOR THESE SEQUENCES TO ARCHIVE GEOLOGIC, BIOLOGIC AND CLIMATOLOGIC CHANGES IN A TERRESTRIAL ENVIRONMENT IS IMMENSE. IN ADDITION, UNDERSTANDING THESE CHANGES IN THE CONTEXT OF METEORITE IMPACT EVENTS AND THEIR LOCAL AND/OR REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF IMPACT PROCESSES AND THEIR EFFECT ON OUR SURROUNDINGS. PRIOR AND ON GOING WORK (FUNDED THROUGH AN NASA EPSCOR-RID AWARD) HAS HELPED TO DEVELOP ENVIRONMENTAL MAGNETIC AND ORGANIC GEOCHEMICAL PROXIES THAT CAN BE USED TO CHARACTERIZE THESE LOESS SEQUENCES. THE STUDY PROPOSED HERE, HOWEVER, WILL USE THESE NEW ENVIRONMENTAL PROXIES TO TEST THEIR USE TO CHARACTERIZE THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER ONE SPECIFIC IMPACT DURING THE MID-PLIOCENE IN ARGENTINA (3.3MA) NEAR MAR DEL PLATA.

IF SUCCESSFUL, THEN THESE RESULTS CAN BE APPLIED TO OTHER IMPORTANT TRANSITIONS IN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. THIS EFFORT DIRECTLY ADDRESSES EPSCOR OBJECTIVES BY CONTINUING AND STRENGTHENING THE COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH BETWEEN JURISDICTION UNIVERSITIES (UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND AND BROWN UNIVERSITY), DEMONSTRATING THE USE OF A NEW TRACER OF THE BIOLOGIC RESPONSE TO AN IMPACT, PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVOLVE GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS IN AN INTERNATIONAL, MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH PROGRAM, AND CREATING AND ENHANCING OTHER FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES (E.G., NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NASA EXOBIOLOGY)."

THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THIS PROPOSED STUDY ARE TWOFOLD: (1) TO USE TEMPERATURE- AND COMPOSITION DEPENDENT MINERAL-MELT AND MINERAL-MINERAL REE PARTITION COEFFICIENTS TO INFER MAGMATIC AND SUBSOLIDUS PROCESSES EXPERIENCED BY MAFIC AND ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS FROM THE MOON (LUNAR FERROAN ANORTHOSITES AND MG-SUITE ROCKS), MARS, AND HED METEORITES, AND (2) TO EXPLORE THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR THE AGE AND THE THERMAL AND MAGMATIC EVOLUTION OF PARENT BODIES. GIVEN THE UBIQUITOUS PRESENCE OF PLAGIOCLASE AND PYROXENE IN CUMULATE ROCKS FROM THE MOON, MARS, AND HED METEORITES, WE PLAN TO DEVELOP A REE-INPLAGIOCLASECLINOPYROXENE THERMOMETER AND A REE-IN-PLAGIOCLASE-ORTHOPYROXENE THERMOMETER FOR MAFIC AND ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS IN THIS PROPOSED STUDY. A REE-IN-TWO PYROXENE THERMOMETER WAS RECENTLY DEVELOPED IN PI S LAB FOR MAFIC AND ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS. PART OF THIS PROPOSED STUDY WILL FOCUS ON ITS FURTHER CALIBRATION IN FE-RICH SYSTEMS AND ITS PLANETARY APPLICATION. DUE TO THEIR SLOW DIFFUSION RATES, TRIVALENT REE HAVE HIGHER CLOSURE TEMPERATURES THAN DIVALENT CA, MG, AND FE IN PYROXENE AND PLAGIOCLASE. THE DIFFERENCES IN TEMPERATURES BETWEEN THE REE-BASED THERMOMETERS AND THE DIVALENT CATION-BASED THERMOMETERS WILL BE USED TO INFER COOLING RATES OF THE CUMULATE ROCKS. THE LATTER CAN SHED NEW LIGHT ON THE THERMAL HISTORY OF THE PARENT BODIES. RELEVANCY: MAFIC AND ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS ARE UBIQUITOUS IN INNER SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES. ABUNDANCES AND DISTRIBUTIONS OF REE IN THESE MAFIC AND ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS PROVIDE IMPORTANT CLUES TO UNDERSTANDING THE CHEMICAL AND THERMAL EVOLUTION OF PLANETARY INTERIORS THROUGH TIME. THIS PROPOSED STUDY IS DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THE SCOPES OF SOLAR SYSTEM WORKINGS BY PRODUCING NEW MINERAL-MELT REE PARTITIONING DATA AND DEVELOPING THREE NEW THERMOMETERS FOR PLANETARY MATERIALS, BY EXAMINING THE MEASURED SM-ND AGES OF LUNAR HIGHLANDS  SAMPLES, THE BY ANALYZING PLANETARY MATERIALS, AND BY PROVIDING NEW METHODS FOR ASSESSING THE THERMAL AND CHEMICAL EVOLUTION OF PLANETARY MANTLE AND LITHOSPHERE. METHODOLOGY: LABORATORY CRYSTAL GROWTH EXPERIMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED IN THE SYSTEM PLAGIOCLASE-PYROXENE-BASALT OVER A RANGE OF TEMPERATURES (1050#tilde#1400 C), PRESSURES (0#tilde#2 GPA), AND (EVOLVED) MELT COMPOSITIONS. MAJOR AND TRACE ELEMENT ABUNDANCES IN QUENCHED RUN PRODUCTS WILL BE ANALYZED USING AN ELECTRON MICROPROBE AND A LASER ABLATION INDUCTIVELY COUPLED PLASMA MASS SPECTROMETRY (LA-ICP-MS) AT BROWN UNIVERSITY. TOGETHER WITH PUBLISHED HIGH QUALITY PLAGIOCLASE-MELT AND PYROXENE-MELT TRACE ELEMENT PARTITIONING DATA, WE WILL DEVELOP INTERNALLY CONSISTENT LATTICE STRAIN MODELS FOR REE PARTITIONING IN THE AFOREMENTIONED MINERAL-MELT SYSTEMS USING A NONLINEAR LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION METHOD. WITH LABORATORY CALIBRATED TEMPERATURE- AND COMPOSITION-DEPENDENT MINERAL-MINERAL REE PARTITIONING MODELS, WE WILL BE ABLE TO CALCULATE TEMPERATURES FOR THE MAFIC AND ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS USING MEASURED PLAGIOCLASEPYROXENE REE PARTITION COEFFICIENTS. WE WILL ASSESS EFFECTS OF DISEQUILIBRIUM CRYSTALLIZATION, DIFFUSION AND SUBSOLIDUS RE-EQUILIBRATION ON REE ABUNDANCES IN COEXISTING PLAGIOCLASE AND PYROXENES IN THE CUMULATE SAMPLES THROUGH NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS AND EXAMINE THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR THE MEASURED SM-ND AGES AND INFERRED PARENTAL MELT COMPOSITIONS.

MUCH OF THAT EVIDENCE HAS COME FROM VISIBLE TO NEAR-INFRARED (VNIR) SPECTROSCOPY.  BY COMPARING THE MINERALS DETECTED BY VNIR SPECTROSCOPY TO TERRESTRIAL ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THESE MINERALS FORM, WE START TO UNDERSTAND THE RANGE OF PAST AQUEOUS ENVIRONMENTS THAT EXISTED ON MARS. HOWEVER, ONE OF THE MAJOR LIMITATIONS OF VNIR SPECTROSCOPY IS HOW IT RESPONDS TO MIXTURES OF MINERALS. MINERALS WITH STRONG OPTICAL CONSTANTS CAN OBSCURE THE VNIR SIGNATURES OF MINERALS WITH WEAK CONSTANTS, EVEN IF THE SECOND MINERAL EXISTS IN MUCH GREATER ABUNDANCE. THIS SPECTRAL MASKING EFFECT CAN COMPLICATE THE INTERPRETATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ON MARS, BECAUSE KEY MINERAL ASSEMBLAGES CAN BE OBSCURED. AN IMPORTANT EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE CASE OF IRON-BEARING OXYHYDROXIDES AND SULFATES, WHICH HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AT SEVERAL LOCATIONS ON THE MARTIAN SURFACE, AND ARE OFTEN USED AS MARKERS OF LIQUID WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, ENVIRONMENTAL INTERPRETATIONS ON THE BASIS OF HYDRATED IRON MINERALS ARE ONLY USEFUL TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN ESTIMATE THEIR ABUNDANCE AND DISTRIBUTION IN GEOLOGIC AND GEOGRAPHIC CONTEXT. BECAUSE THEY FORM IN SIMILAR ENVIRONMENTS  AND OFTEN ARE PRODUCTS OF EACH OTHER THEY LIKELY OCCUR ON MARS IN MIXTURES, MAKING IT IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THE SPECTRAL APPEARANCE OF MIXTURES OF IRON OXIDE AND IRON SULFATE MINERALS IN THE VNIR. HERE, WE PROPOSE TO STUDY TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF MIXTURES ON THE VNIR SPECTRA OF IRON OXYHYDROXIDES AND ON VNIR SPECTRA FROM MARS. OBJECTIVE: REFINE CAPABILITIES TO ASSESS MINERALOGY OF MARTIAN VNIR SPECTRA IN TERMS OF MIXTURES OF IRON OXYHYDROXIDES AND IRON SULFATE MINERALS.  METHODOLOGY: VNIR SPECTRA FROM NASA''S SATELLITE-BORNE COMPACT RECONNAISSANCE IMAGING SPECTROMETER FOR MARS (CRISM) WILL BE COMPARED TO SPECTRA OF LABORATORY MIXTURES OF IRON OXYHYDROXIDES AND IRON SULFATES, AND TO NATURAL SAMPLES. THE LABORATORY MIXTURES WILL BE PREPARED AND ANALYZED WITH A VNIR SPECTROMETER AND X-RAY DIFFRACTOMETER, WITH THE GOAL OF IDENTIFYING THE COMPOSITION AT WHICH A MINERAL (X) WILL SPECTRALLY MASK ANOTHER (Y). ONCE THE COMPOSITION AT WHICH X IS MASKED IN AN XY MIXTURE IS DETERMINED, THEN GRAIN SIZES OF X WILL BE VARIED IN THE MIXTURES TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF GRAIN SIZE ON SPECTRAL MASKING. MIXTURES WILL BE COMPARED TO FIELD SAMPLES ALREADY OBTAINED FROM ACID MINE DRAINAGE SYSTEMS IN SOUTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA AND RIO TINTO, SPAIN. FINALLY, THE LABORATORY MIXTURES AND NATURAL SAMPLES WILL BE COMPARED TO CRISM SPECTRA FROM MARS OVER AREAS PREVIOUSLY MAPPED AS HAVING IRON OXYHYDROXIDES AND IRON SULFATES.  RELEVANCE: THE PROPOSED STUDY IS RELEVANT TO MDAP, AS IT FOCUSES ON ENHANCING THE RETURNS FROM THE CRISM INSTRUMENT ABOARD MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (MRO). WE PROPOSE TO ANALYZE PUBLICLY-RELEASED DATA FROM THE CRISM INSTRUMENT. SPECIFICALLY, THIS PROGRAM WILL INVOLVE, \ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON OF MARS ORBITAL AND SURFACE DATA TO INCREASE THE PREDICTIVE ACCURACY OF SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS OF MARS FROM ORBIT.\""  SIGNIFICANCE: THIS WORK WILL ALLOW OTHER MARS RESEARCHERS TO MORE ACCURATELY DESCRIBE THE MINERALOGY OF COMPLEX SITES ON MARS, INCLUDING POTENTIAL NEW LANDING SITES FOR FUTURE MISSIONS. ADDITIONALLY, IT WILL CONTINUE THE WORK OF LINKING TERRESTRIAL AND MARTIAN LOW TEMPERATURE GEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES, AND OF USING EARTH ANALOG ENVIRONMENTS TO UNDERSTAND PAST ENVIRONMENTS ON MARS."""

TOP-DOWN AND BOTTOM-UP REGIONAL AND GLOBAL CH4 BUDGETS OFTEN DISAGREE SIGNIFICANTLY, EG, HSU ET AL (2009) FOUND AN #tilde#40% DISCREPANCY FOR THE LA BASIN. MUCH OF THE DISCREPANCY COULD RELATE TO FOSSIL CH4 FROM FUGITIVE INDUSTRIAL (FFI) AND GEOLOGIC SOURCES; A RECENT LA BASIN SURVEY (NOAA) SUGGESTS FFI. SOME STUDIES SUGGEST RECENT CH4STABILIZATION WAS FROM GLOBAL FFI CH4 EMISSION DECREASES. RECENT TRANSCONTINENTAL GROUND CH4 DATA VALIDATED SCIAMACHY&GOSAT DATA WITH SIMILAR CONCLUSIONS. OTHERS SUGGEST AN #tilde#50% US FFI UNDERESTIMATE. THE PLANNED AVIRIS/MASTER FLIGHTS COVER SIGNIFICANT FFI INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AND GEOLOGIC CH4 EMISSION SITES. THE KEY STUDY SCIENCE QUESTION IS: WHAT ARE THE RELATIVE CALIFORNIA CONTRIBUTIONS OF FOSSIL GEOLOGIC AND FFI CH4? I.E., ADDRESSING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FOSSIL CH4 EMISSIONS AND GEOLOGIC, MARINE, AND ATMOSPHERIC (EG, INVERSION LAYERS, BUOYANT RISE) CONTROLS. THIS PRIMARILY IS AN APPLICATION STUDY USING AVIRIS (EG, HYSPIRI VSWIR) AND MASTER (EG, HYSPIRI TIR) AND TO A LESSER EXTENT A RESEARCH STUDY. IT DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE RFP BY: 1) DEMONSTRATING SCIENCE APPLICATIONS (CH4 EMISSION) ENABLED BY HYSPIRI-LIKE SENSORS AND AIDS HYSPIRI MISSION DESIGN (BAND SELECTION AND BINNING,ALGORITHMS); 2) PROVIDING UNPRECEDENTED INFORMATION FOR RESOURCE MANAGEMENT TO RESOURCE MANAGERS THOUGH MERGING AVIRIS DATA WITH EXISTING DATA. THE STUDY FITS HYSPIRI MISSION GOALS THROUGH ADDRESSING SCIENCE DEFINITION TEAM QUESTIONS: CQ5 (TERRESTRIAL SURFACE COMPOSITION), TQ4 (URBANIZATION AND ENVIRONMENT), AND VQ2 (SEASONAL CYCLES OF TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEM AND LAND DISTURBANCE AND CLIMATECHANGE). OUR TEAM COMPRISES SCIENTISTS AND RESOURCE MANAGERS WITH SPECIFIC EXPERTISE TO ASSURE PROJECT SUCCESS. WE WILL STUDY FACTORS AFFECTING TRACE GAS (CH4, CO2) SWIR RETRIEVALS IN AVIRIS SWIR DATA FOR FOSSIL SOURCES TO CHARACTERIZE THE EFFECT OF ALBEDO, NADIR ANGLE, AEROSOLS, WATER VAPOR, PATH RADIANCE, VERTICAL PROFILES, SURFACE SPECTRAL NON-UNIFORMITY, PIXEL SIZE, SPECTRAL RESOLUTION, AND SPECTRAL SPACING. SWIR-DERIVED CH4 WILL BE COMPARED WITH MASTER TIR SPECTRAL CH4 ANOMALIES. RETRIEVAL APPROACHES INCLUDING NEIGHBORING PIXEL NORMALIZATION, BAND RATIO, RESIDUAL MINIMIZATION, AND STATISTICAL MEASURES, BASED ON RADIATIVE TRANSFER CALCULATIONS FOR SWIR AND TIR ABSORPTION FEATURES WILL BE INVESTIGATED. IMPROVED SWIR TRACE GAS RETRIEVALS USING TIR-DERIVED VERTICAL PROFILESWILL BE STUDIED. MOBIL GROUND-REFERENCE CH4 MEASUREMENTS INCLUDING EDDY COVARIANCE FLUXES, AND ALKANE GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY OF C2-C8 WILL PROVIDE RELEVANT SIZE SCALES AND NATURAL GAS FINGERPRINTING.

MANY OF THESE IMPACTS HAVE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CLIMATE FEEDBACKS REGIONALLY AND GLOBALLY. CHARACTERIZING ARCTIC CHANGES ON SYNOPTIC SCALES, GIVEN LOGISTICAL AND WEATHER CONSTRAINTS, REQUIRES SATELLITE DATA. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT ARCTIC OCEAN REGIONAL-SCALE CH4 IS CORRELATED NEGATIVELY WITH FRACTIONAL ICE COVER ON SEASONAL AND AN INTER-ANNUAL BASES. MOREOVER, THERE IS EVIDENCE FORM IASI THAT CH4 IS INCREASING, SUCH AS A COMPARISON BETWEEN CH4 MAPS FOR NOVEMBER IN 2008 AND 2012. OUR MAIN HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE ARCTIC OCEAN IS A REGIONAL CH4 SOURCE WITH SEA ICE COVER EITHER COMPLETELY OR PARTIALLY BLOCKS THESE FLUXES, IN AGREEMENT WITH GEOLOGIC EVIDENCE (SEVERINGHAUS&BROOK 1999) AND RECENT ARCTIC OCEAN DATA (SHAKHOVA ET AL 2010A;B). INCREASED ICE-FREE ARCTIC CONDITIONS WILL RESULT IN RISING ARCTIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO GLOBAL CH4 BUDGETS EVEN WITHOUT SOURCE EMISSION STRENGTH GROWTH. TERRA AND AQUA INSTRUMENTS PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT DATA (SST, ALGAE, CDOM, ICE COVER) FOR TESTING THIS HYPOTHESIS WHEN COMBINED WITH CH4 ATMOSPHERIC COLUMN ABUNDANCES, DERIVED FROM IASI. THE IASI SPECTRAL RESOLUTION ALLOWS AN AVERAGING KERNEL TO DERIVE LOWER CH4 (600 MB) THAN THE COARSER SPECTRAL RESOLUTION AIRS DATA (400 MB). OCEAN COLOR MODIS DATA IS FUSED WITH VIIRS AND CRIS. IN THIS PROJECT WE WILL ASSEMBLE AND FUSE THE ARCTIC DATA SOURCES FOR CH4 (IASI AND AIRS) AND SEA ICE COVER (MODIS, MASIE-NH). WE DERIVE CLOUD MASKS FROM MODIS DATA USING A NEW APPROACH AND THE STANDARD CLOUD PRODUCT. THE BOUNDARY LAYER WILL BE DERIVED DIRECTLY FROM CALIPSO AEROSOL DATA, AND INDIRECTLY FROM MODIS AND AMSR-E SST AND CLOUD TOP TEMPERATURES TO DERIVE A LAPSE RATE. BOUNDARY LAYER INFORMATION (WHICH LARGELY CONFINES THE CH4 (SHAKHOVA ET AL 2010A) WILL IMPROVE CH4 RETRIEVALS FROM AIRS/IASI THROUGH BETTER ADDRESSING THERMAL PROFILE CONTRAST EFFECTS. THIS STUDY ADDRESSES KEY SCIENCE QUESTIONS: 1. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT SST POORLY CHARACTERIZES UPPER ARCTIC OCEAN WATER-COLUMN WARMING AND THAT PARAMETERS LIKE ALGAL OCEAN COLOR, SEA ICE PERSISTENCE, AND SEABED CH4 EMISSIONS ARE BETTER CORRELATED. 2. HOW DOES THE MARINE ARCTIC CH4 CONTRIBUTION AND GROWTH COMPARE WITH TERRESTRIAL CH4 ARCTIC CONTRIBUTION AND GROWTH LEADING TO ACCELERATING AND REGIONALLY SIGNIFICANT ARCTIC WARMING? 3. WHAT ARE THE TEMPORAL (SEASONAL AND INTER-ANNUAL) TRENDS OF THESE SOURCES AND EMISSIONS? 4. HOW DOES VARIABILITY IN OCEAN PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS AND PRODUCTIVITY RELATE TO SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE, WATER COLUMN STABILITY (HEATING, ICE MELT, RIVERINE AND PRECIPITATION INPUTS), AND PHOTOSYNTHETICALLY ACTIVE RADIATION (PAR) RELATE TO ICE-FREE PERIODS? HOW DO THESE TEMPERATURE-INFLUENCED PARAMETERS CORRELATE WITH CH4 EMISSIONS? 5. HOW DO THE INTER-ANNUAL TRENDS IN ICE COVER (FROM MODIS, AVHRR, AND VARIOUS MICROWAVE SATELLITE DATA) RELATE TO PARAMETERS KNOWN TO VARY WITH WATER COLUMN TEMPERATURE AND SST? IN THIS STUDY, WE WILL PROVIDE: 1. HISTORICAL TRENDS OF KEY ARCTIC PARAMETERS TO BE ANALYZED WITH PUBLISHED HISTORICAL TRENDS IN ARCTIC OCEAN TEMPERATURES TO IDENTIFY THE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT HEAT INPUT SOURCES ON CLIMACTIC AND OTHER TEMPORAL SCALES (EL NINO, ECONOMIC CYCLES, SEASONAL E.G., SPRING THAW, ETC.). 2. DIFFERENT SOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS IN BOTH THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DOMAINS WILL BE IDENTIFIED USING PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS AND OTHER STATISTICAL APPROACHES. 3.

AN AIRCRAFT''S SHAPE IS THE NATURAL STARTING POINT FOR PHYSICS-BASED MULTIDISCIPLINARY ANALYSIS AND OPTIMIZATION. ITS OUTER MOLD LINES AND STRUCTURAL LAYOUT ARE THE INTERFACE BETWEEN AERODYNAMICS, STRUCTURES, MASS PROPERTIES, AND ALL THE PHYSICS THAT IMPACT A VEHICLE''S PERFORMANCE. PARAMETRIC GEOMETRY TOOLS SUCH AS NASA''S VEHICLE SKETCH PAD (VSP) DESCRIBE AN AIRCRAFT S GEOMETRY BY USING THE TERMS MOST FAMILIAR TO DESIGNERS; THE PARAMETRIC APPROACH IS IDEALLY SUITED TO THE RAPID EXPLORATION PROCESS CHARACTERISTIC OF CONCEPTUAL DESIGN. PHOENIX INTEGRATION''S MODELCENTER IS A PREMIER MULTIDISCIPLINARY INTEGRATION TOOL WHICH FINDS POPULAR USE IN INDUSTRY AND NASA. THE DECISION MAKERS INVOLVED IN THE DESIGN OF THE NEXT GENERATIONS OF AIR VEHICLES NEED THE ABILITY TO SELECT AND VARY THE LEVEL OF ANALYSIS FIDELITY TO SUIT THE DECISION BEING MADE. UNFORTUNATELY, ANALYSIS FIDELITY IS OFTEN DICTATED BY THE AVAILABLE TOOLS. THIS LIMITATION FREQUENTLY STEMS FROM THE UNDERLYING GEOMETRY REPRESENTATION. IN THIS RESEARCH, WE PROPOSE TO EXTEND AND ENHANCE VSP SO THAT IT WILL BE CAPABLE OF INTEGRATING LOW, MID, AND HIGH-FIDELITY ANALYSES INTO THE DESIGN PROCESS IN A TRULY VARIABLE FIDELITY MANNER, ALL BASED ON A COMMON GEOMETRIC MODEL. VSP WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFIED AND RE-DESIGNED TO BECOME MORE MODULAR AND EXTENDABLE, BETTER FACILITATING INTEGRATION WITH ANALYSIS TOOLS AND INTEGRATION ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS PHOENIX INTEGRATION''S MODELCENTER. MODELCENTER WILL BECOME MORE INTELLIGENT ABOUT GEOMETRY AND THE SENSITIVITIES INHERENT TO DESIGN PROCESSES. VSP WILL BECOME MORE INTELLIGENT ABOUT GEOMETRY AND THE ROLE IT PLAYS IN PHYSICS-BASED ANALYSIS, HELPING TO COUPLE ANALYSES BY MAPPING SOLUTIONS BETWEEN MODELS. VSP WILL BECOME MORE FLEXIBLE, ALLOWING CUSTOM DEFINITION OF NEW PARAMETRIC COMPONENTS. VSP WILL BECOME BETTER CONNECTED TO HIGH-FIDELITY ANALYSIS, BUT ALSO BETTER CONNECTED TO LOW AND MID-FIDELITY ANALYSES. THIS WILL ENABLE VARIABLE FIDELITY DESIGN BASED ON A COMMON GEOMETRY MODEL. THESE COMBINED ADVANCES WILL RESULT IN A GEOMETRY ENGINE AND AN INTEGRATION FRAMEWORK WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE INTELLIGENT, MORE EXTENSIBLE, AND MORE CAPABLE THAT WHAT IS AVAILABLE TODAY. THESE TOOLS WILL ENABLE MULTI-FIDELITY AND MULTI-PHYSICS ANALYSIS EARLY IN THE DESIGN PROCESS WHEN FUNDAMENTAL DECISIONS ARE MADE.

SINCE THE DAWN OF HEAVIER THAN AIR FLIGHT, AEROSPACE HAS BEEN THE MOST ADVANCED APPLICATION OF ANY ENERGY TECHNOLOGY SUITABLE FOR USE AS A LIGHTWEIGHT PRIME MOVER.  THE NEED FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE, LIGHT WEIGHT, LOW SPECIFIC FUEL CONSUMPTION, AND HIGH RELIABILITY HAVE ENSURED THAT ADVANCES IN PISTON ENGINES, ROCKET MOTORS, AND GAS TURBINES HAVE ALL COME ON THE BACK OF AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS. NEW ENERGY AND PRIME MOVER TECHNOLOGIES HAVE A UNIQUE ABILITY TO ENABLE NEW AIRCRAFT CONCEPTS, CONFIGURATIONS, AND TECHNOLOGIES.

NASA IS A ONE-SIXTH PARTNER IN WMKO, HAVING INVESTED ONESIXTH OF THE CAPITAL COSTS AND ONE-SIXTH OF THE OPERATIONS COSTS SINCE CIRCA 1996. THE RESEARCH PROGRAM PROPOSED HERE MAPS SQUARELY TO THE ASTRONOMICAL PRIORITIES OF NASA, NAMELY, THE ORIGINS OF GALAXIES, ELEMENTS, STARS AND PLANETARY SYSTEMS AND INCREASING THE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM. THE SPECIFIC RESEARCH FOCUS AREAS ARE (I) THE DETECTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF PLANETS AROUND OTHER STARS, (II) THE ORIGIN AND NATURE OF PLANETARY SYSTEMS, (III) STUDIES OF OUR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM, AND (IV) STUDIES IN GALAXY FORMATION, EVOLUTION AND COSMOLOGY. THIS ADVANCEMENT IN KNOWLEDGE WILL PROVIDE A FOUNDATION FOR PLANNING AND INTERPRETING THE RESULTS FROM A VARIETY OF NASA PROGRAMS AND MISSIONS. WMKO PROPOSES TO DEVOTE 1/6 OF AVAILABLE OBSERVING TIME TO NASA-SELECTED PROGRAMS IN THESE AREAS. GIVEN THE HIGH OVERSUBSCRIPTION FOR NASA TIME, WMKO ALSO PROPOSES THE OPTION FOR NASA TO MAKE AVAILABLE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL 10 NIGHTS PER YEAR. FINALLY, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE NASA EXOPLANET SCIENCE INSTITUTE, WMKO PLANS TO CONTINUE ITS KECK OBSERVATORY ARCHIVE (KOA) ACTIVITIES. THE KECK OBSERVATORY IS UNIQUELY SUITED TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY RESEARCH TOOLS TO ADDRESS THE RESEARCH TOPICS DISCUSSED ABOVE. WMKO WILL SUPPLY ALL THE NECESSARY EQUIPMENT AND SUPPORT PERSONNEL TO OPERATE THE OBSERVATORY, 24 HOURS/DAY, 7 DAYS/WEEK, AND 365 NIGHTS/YEAR. NASA WILL CONTRIBUTE TECHNICAL, SCIENTIFIC, AND MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE, SELECT OBSERVERS, AND PERFORM RELATED TASKS CONTRIBUTING TO THE SCIENTIFIC EFFECTIVENESS OF THE KECK OBSERVATORY. THIS PROPOSAL REQUESTS NASA FUNDING FOR 1/6 OF THE BASIC OPERATIONS COST OF THE OBSERVATORY, AN APPROPRIATE SHARE OF FACILITY RENEWAL ACTIVITIES, SUPPORT FOR THE WMKO PORTION OF THE KECK OBSERVATORY ARCHIVE, AND THE OPTION OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL 10 OBSERVING NIGHTS PER YEAR. THESE COSTS COVER A PROPORTIONAL SHARE OF THE SALARIES OF 119 SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL, IN ADDITION TO ALL SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THIS MAJOR RESEARCH FACILITY.
