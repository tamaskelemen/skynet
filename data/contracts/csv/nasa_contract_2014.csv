THE PHASE 2 PROGRAM WILL MAKE THE FIRST LARGE SCALE HYBRID GEARS THAT CAN BE RUN IN A ROTATING GEAR RIG WITH IMPOSED TORQUE LOADING. SEVERAL FULL SCALE GEARS WILL BE MADE AS WELL AS FULL SCALE TEST ELEMENTS. TEST RESULTS FROM FULL SCALE TESTING WILL BE APPLIED TO COMPUTER SIMULATION MODELS. THIS EFFORT WILL APPLY TOPOLOGY OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES TO PREDICT THE BEST DESIGN OF THE GEAR ELEMENTS. THIS SHOULD ENABLE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EFFICIENT DESIGNS THAN THOSE FABRICATED AND TESTED IN THE PHASE 1 PROGRAM.

NASA ESTIMATES THAT THE CURRENT MARS TO EARTH TRANSFER RATE OF 6 MBPS MIGHT BE INCREASED TO 600MBPS USING A LASER COMMUNICATION (LC) SYSTEM. BEAM JITTER CAUSED BY SPACECRAFT BASED MOTION MUST BE REDUCED TO SUB-MICRORADIAN LEVELS TO ENABLE BEACONLESS OPTICAL BEAM POINTING. ATA WILL CREATE A COMPACT, LIGHTWEIGHT ISOLATION PLATFORM (CLIP) THAT WILL HOST THE LC COLLIMATOR TELESCOPE AND PROVIDE A STABILIZED PLATFORM TO PREVENT THE 150-MICRORADIAN SPACECRAFT DISTURBANCE ENVIRONMENT FROM REACHING THE LC TERMINAL. TO ENABLE THAT STABILIZATION, ATA WILL DEVELOP AN ULTRALOWANGULAR NOISE CAPACITIVE ANGULAR POSITION SENSOR (CAPS). THE PROPOSED SENSOR WILL HAVE LOW POWER AND HIGH RELIABILITY, WHICH ATA WILL DEMONSTRATE BY PRODUCING TRL 4 PROTOTYPES IN PHASE I AND TRL 5 CLIP ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT UNIT (EDU) IN PHASE II. THE INTEGRATED CLIP OVERALL DESIGN IS A MAJOR INNOVATION. MOST SIGNIFICANTLY, THE PLATFORM PAYLOAD CAPACITY MUST INCREASE FROM THE TYPICAL FEW HUNDRED GRAMS TO AS MUCH AS 50 KILOGRAMS, ROUGHLY TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE, BUT WITHOUT MAJOR GROWTH IN THE MASS OF THE PLATFORM ITSELF. WHILE THE PAYLOAD FORMOST STABLE PLATFORMS IS ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE PLATFORM OVERALL MASS, THE CLIP PAYLOAD MUST BEFROM MORE THAN HALF (3 KG) TO AS MUCH AS 94 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL PLATFORM MASS (3-50 KG PAYLOAD + 3 KG PLATFORM). COMBINED WITH THE LARGE PAYLOAD RANGE, THE NEEDED DISTURBANCE REJECTION FROM 150- MICRORADIAN TO LESS THAN 0.5-MICRORADIAN ACROSS THE BROAD FREQUENCY RANGE OF 0.1 TO 500 HZ REQUIRES INNOVATION IN THE PLATFORM SUSPENSION, HIGH-PERFORMANCE ACTUATORS, SERVO CONTROLS, AND STRUCTURE.

IN PHASE I WEDISCOVERED A NEW THEORY OF DATA COMPRESSION WITH UNPRECEDENTED CAPABILITY TO REDUCE DATA MOVEMENT IN DISTRIBUTED HPC APPLICATIONS. PHASE I RESULTS INCLUDE: 1) THE DEMONSTRATION VIA PROOF-OF-CONCEPT PROTOTYPES OF LOSSLESS COMPRESSIVE GAINS OF 4X-20X FOR NAS PARALLEL BENCHMARKS, AND 2) THE FORMULATION OF COPA, A COMPRESSION OPPORTUNITIES AUDITING&DISCOVERY PROCESS THAT FACILITATES THE ANALYSIS OF ANY GIVEN LARGE-SCALE CODE WITH THE PURPOSE OF OPTIMIZING IT FOR PERFORMANCE VIA DATA MOVEMENT REDUCTION. PHASE II TARGETS THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE NEW THEORY THROUGH TWO MAJOR THRUSTS: 1) THE DEVELOPMENT OFSOFTWARE THAT FACILITATES INTEGRATING HIGH-YIELD COMPRESSION INTO HPC CODES, AND 2) THE FURTHER INFUSIONOF THE TECHNOLOGY INTO NASA APPLICATIONS. THRUST 1 WILL PRODUCE A FULLY FUNCTIONAL PROTOTYPE OF A SOFTWARE SUITE FOR THE AUTOMATIC/SEMI-AUTOMATIC ACCELERATION OF HPC CODES VIA COMPRESSION. THE PROTOTYPE WILL INCORPORATE EASE-OF-INFUSION FEATURES (E.G., MPI-ENABLED COMPRESSION AND DECOMPRESSION ROUTINES), AS WELL AS ERGONOMIC FEATURES THAT ALLOW THE SEAMLESS INTEGRATION OF NEW COMPRESSIONMODULES INTO THE SUITE. THRUST 2 WILL BEGIN WITH THE APPLICATION OF THE CHAPTER 1 OF COPA TO FIVE HPC CODES OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO NASA, NAMELY CART3D, FUN3D, USM3D, ENZO, AND WRF. ACCELOGIC WILL COLLABORATE WITH THE DEVELOPERS OF THESE CODES TO INTEGRATE THE COMPRESSION TECHNOLOGY UNDER THREE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF \INTEGRABILITY,\"" NAMELY AUTOMATIC, SEMI-AUTOMATIC, AND MANUAL.

AS OUR EXPERIENCE OF VLBI HARDWARE UPGRADE SHOWED, IMPROVEMENT OF OBSERVING HARDWARE ALONE IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR IMPROVING THE ACCURACY OF STATION POSITION DETERMINATION.

THE ESSENCE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR COMPUTING PATH DELAY THROUGH THE NEUTRAL ATMOSPHERE BY DIRECT INTEGRATION OF EQUATIONS OF RADIO WAVE PROPAGATION USING THE OUTPUT OF NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS OF A NEW GENERATION: REANALYSIS MODEL MERRA, OPERATIONAL MODEL GEOS-5.6 DEVELOPED AT THE NASA GLOBAL MODELING AND ASSIMILATION OFFICE, AND THE CLIMATE FORECAST SYSTEM REANALYSIS DEVELOPED BY NOAA. THE PATH DELAYS WILL BE COMPUTED IN THE FORM THAT CAN BE EASILY UTILIZED BY EXISTING SOFTWARE FOR PROCESSING VLBI, GPS, AND DORIS OBSERVATIONS. THE GOAL IS TO MODEL THE ATMOSPHERE PATH DELAY BETTER AND TO PROVIDE MORE RELIABLE ESTIMATES OF STATION POSITIONS AND SATELLITE ORBITS. OUR APPROACH HINGES ON A SOLUTION OF THREE PROBLEMS THAT WE FOUND IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE PILOT STUDY. THIS INCLUDES 1) DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFICIENT NUMERICAL ALGORITHM FOR EXPANDING THE REFRACTIVITY FIELD OVER A FOUR-DIMENSIONAL TENSOR PRODUCT OF B-SPLINES THAT TRANSFORMS A SET OF DISCRETE REFRACTIVITIES DERIVED FROM THE GRIDDED OUTPUT OF NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS INTO A CONTINUUM FUNCTION WITH SMOOTH PARTIAL DERIVATIVES. 2) FORMULATION OF RADIO WAVE PROPAGATION THROUGH A HETEROGENEOUS CONTINUOUS MEDIUM AS A VARIATIONAL PROBLEM WHICH SOLUTION IS REDUCED TO A SYSTEM OF NON-LINEAR ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF THE 4TH ORDER. 3) DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFICIENT INTERPOLATION METHOD FOR SLANTED PATH DELAYS COMPUTED FOR A GIVEN STATION. THAT ALLOWS TO DECOUPLE COMPUTATION OF PATH DELAY IN THE NEUTRAL ATMOSPHERE FROM GEODETIC DATA ANALYSIS. ALTHOUGH THE NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS CURRENTLY ARE NOT ACCURATE TO THE LEVEL THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO COMPUTE PATH DELAY WITH THE ACCURACY THAT MATCHES THE ACCURACY OF SPACE GEODESY MEASUREMENTS, THEIR USE SHIFTS THE PARADIGM OF A TREATMENT OF PATH DELAY IN THE NEUTRAL ATMOSPHERE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED OVER 40 YEARS AGO. INSTEAD OF USING IN-SITU SURFACE METEOROLOGICAL DATA THAT PROVIDE ESTIMATES OF ZENITH PATH DELAYS WITH A TYPICAL ERROR OF 150-250 MM AND ESTIMATING THE REMAINING DELAYS USING PARTIAL DERIVATIVES, THE SO-CALLED MAPPING FUNCTION, DERIVED FROM A COARSE REGRESSION MODEL, WE CAN COMPUTE THE SLANTED PATH DELAY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE OBSERVING SOURCE OR SATELLITE WITH THE ACCURACY OF 10-15 MM OF THE ZENITH PATH DELAY EQUIVALENT AND TO ESTIMATE RESIDUAL DELAY USING PARTIAL DERIVATIVES COMPUTED FROM THE NUMERICAL WEATHER MODEL. ADVANCES IN NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS WILL MAKE UNNECESSARY ESTIMATION OF PATH DELAY CAUSED BY THE NEUTRAL ATMOSPHERE IN THE FUTURE WHEN EVEN MORE PRECISE NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS WILL BE DEVELOPED. THE PRESENT PROPOSAL SETS THE PATH FOR SUCH A SHIFT IN DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE. THE BENEFITS THAT WE CAN ENJOY RIGHT NOW ARE REDUCING SYSTEMATIC ERRORS ORIGINATING FROM THE A PRIORI MAPPING FUNCTION AND SATISFACTORY MODELING OF THE PATH DELAY AZIMUTHAL DEPENDENCE THAT MAKES ESTIMATION OF THE SO-CALLED TROPOSPHERE GRADIENTS UNNECESSARY. THIS WILL RESULT IN IMPROVEMENT OF STATION POSITION REPEATABILITY AND GETTING A MORE ACCURATE TERRESTRIAL REFERENCE FRAME AND SATELLITE ORBITS. ACCURATE SATELLITE ORBITS ARE THE KEY ELEMENT OF MEAN SEA LEVEL CHANGE MEASUREMENTS.

THESE DATA RODS WEB SERVICES, HOWEVER, THOUGH VISIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE HIS AND THROUGH THE GODDARD EARTH SCIENCES DATA AND INFORMATION SERVICES CENTER (GES DISC), ARE NOT EASILY DISCOVERABLE BY USERS OF OTHER NON-NASA DATA SYSTEMS. THIS IS ALSO THE CASE FOR NASA EOSDIS (EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEM DATA INFORMATION SYSTEM) DATA, IN GENERAL. CONVERSELY, THERE ARE VAST AMOUNTS OF NON-NASA HYDROLOGICAL DATA (E.G., THOSE ACCESSIBLE VIA WEB SERVICES FROM CUAHSI HIS) THAT ARE NOT VISIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE FROM NASA SYSTEMS, SUCH AS THE SIMPLE SUBSET WIZARD (SSW), A COMMON GATEWAY TO DATA ARCHIVED AT NASA DATA CENTERS. THE GLOBAL EARTH OBSERVATION SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS (GEOSS), AS A CATALOG OF CATALOGS, WOULD BE A LOGICAL MECHANISM FOR PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE TIME SERIES COVERAGES OF THE DATA RODS, AS WELL AS ON-THE-FLY TIME SERIES CONVERTED FROM OTHER EOSDIS DATA, COMMONLY ARCHIVED IN THE TIME-STEP ARRAY FORMAT. THERE IS A JUST-BEGUN MULTI-ORGANIZATIONAL GEOSS ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTATION PILOT PHASE-6 (AIP-6) WATER SERVICES PROJECT (WITH PARTICIPANTS THAT INCLUDE MEMBERS OF THIS ACCESS PROPOSAL TEAM) THAT IS AIMED AT THE GEOSS WATER STRATEGIC TARGET  TO PRODUCE [BY 2015] COMPREHENSIVE SETS OF DATA AND INFORMATION PRODUCTS TO SUPPORT DECISION-MAKING FOR EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF THE WORLD''S WATER RESOURCES, BASED ON COORDINATED, SUSTAINED OBSERVATIONS OF THE WATER CYCLE ON MULTIPLE SCALES.  THE SCOPE OF THE WATER SERVICES PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A GLOBAL REGISTRY OF WATER DATA, MAP AND MODELING SERVICES CATALOGUED USING THE STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES OF THE OPEN GEOSPATIAL CONSORTIUM AND THE WORLD METEOROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION. THIS AIP-6 PROJECT BUILDS ON THE RESULTS OF AIP-5, FOR WHICH A GLOBAL PUBLICATION OF FEDERATED OBSERVATION SERVICES FOR STREAMFLOW WAS SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED. THE INDIVIDUAL WEB FEATURE SERVICES ARE REGISTERED WITH THE GEOSS COMMON INFRASTRUCTURE (GCI) AND SHOWN TO BE DISCOVERABLE THEREIN. EACH FEATURE IN A MAP SERVICE DESCRIBES ONE OBSERVED TIME SERIES ACCESSIBLE AT ONE LOCATION AND, IF AVAILABLE, CONTAINS A LINK TO THAT TIME SERIES SERVICE. FURTHERMORE, IT HAS SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT THIS INFRASTRUCTURE CAN ALSO BE ADAPTED TO PROVIDE TIME SERIES ACCESS TO MODEL GRID INFORMATION (E.G., NLDAS, GLDAS) OR GRIDS OF INFORMATION OVER A GEOGRAPHIC DOMAIN FOR A PARTICULAR TIME INTERVAL. THESE PROTOTYPE EFFORTS HAVE SHOWN THE POTENTIAL FOR ENHANCING DISCOVERY, SEARCH, AND ACCESS OF NASA DATA BY NON- NASA USERS. THAT THESE PROTOTYPES HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT THE PROPOSED WORK CAN BE SIMILARLY CARRIED OUT AND WITH LOW RISK. THE OVERALL APPROACH OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT COMPRISES THE FOLLOWING: 1. LEVERAGE SIMPLE SUBSET WIZARD (SSW) API AND ECHO 2. REGISTER DATA RODS AND ON-THE-FLY (OTF) CONVERTED TIME SERIES SERVICES IN GEOSS 3. DEVELOP WEB FEATURE SERVICES (WFS) FOR DATA RODS AND OTF CONVERTED TIME SERIES 4. ENHANCE METADATA IN WFS 5. MAKE NON-NASA DATA VISIBLE TO NASA USERS BY LEVERAGING SSW 6. DEVELOP HYDROLOGICAL USE CASES TO GUIDE PROJECT DEPLOYMENT AND SERVE AS METRICS"

OUR PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVE OF THE EARTH SURFACE AND INTERIOR PROGRAMMATIC INTEREST: GEOPHYSICAL MODELS AND ANALYSIS SYSTEMS THAT ADVANCE REAL-TIME OR NEAR REAL-TIME GEODETIC PRODUCTS DERIVED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FROM ESTABLISHED INFRASTRUCTURE FOCUSED ON MITIGATION OF GEOHAZARDS. PROCESSING SPACE GEODESY OBSERVATIONS REQUIRES DATA REDUCTION FOR EARTH ROTATION THAT VARIES DUE TO 1) EXTERNAL TORQUES EXERTED BY THE MOON, SUN AND PLANETS, AND 2) MASS REDISTRIBUTION IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND HYDROSPHERE. PROCESSING DEDICATED VERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY (VLBI) OBSERVATIONS AS WELL AS OTHER SPACE GEODESY DATA ALLOWS US TO DETERMINE EOPS FOR THE PAST. HOWEVER, FOR PROCESSING REAL-TIME OR NEAR REAL TIME OBSERVATIONS THE EOPS FOR THE CURRENT INSTANT OF TIME ARE NOT AVAILABLE. THE ESSENCE OF OUR PROJECT ARE TWO ELEMENTS. FIRST, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR COMPUTATION OF THE ANGULAR MOMENT OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND HYDROSPHERE FROM THE FORECAST OF THE NASA GLOBAL MODELING AND ASSIMILATION OFFICE (GMAO) MODELS GEOSFP AND GEOS-FPIT THAT COVER THE TIME PERIOD FROM 2000.01.01 IN THE PAST THROUGH 24-36 HOURS IN THE FUTURE. USING ESTIMATES OF THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM, WE COMPUTE THE EARTH ORIENTATION PARAMETERS BY NUMERICAL INTEGRATION OF LIOUVILLE''S EQUATION STARTING FROM THE LATEST EOP MEASUREMENT TAKEN AS AN INITIAL VALUE. SECOND, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AN INTERNET SERVICE THAT WILL ALLOW A USER TO RETRIEVE THE EARTH''S ROTATION MATRIX AND ITS DERIVATIVES ANYTIME SINCE 1979.01.01 TO 24 HOURS IN THE FUTURE IN A TOTALLY AUTOMATIC FASHION USING THE OPENDAP PROTOCOL. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SUCH A SERVICE IS THAT ALL COMPLEXITY OF ACCURATE EOP PREDICTION ON THE BASIS OF NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS AND DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS WILL BE COMPLETELY CARRIED OUT BY THE REMOTE SERVER AND IT WILL NOT REQUIRE A HUMAN INTERVENTION. THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR REAL-TIME OR NEAR REAL-TIME SPACE GEODESY APPLICATIONS, ALTHOUGH NON REAL-TIME APPLICATIONS WILL BENEFIT FROM AUTOMATION AS WELL. IMPROVED ACCURACY OF EOP PREDICTION USING THE OUTPUT OF NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS WILL IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF SITE POSITION DETERMINATION, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR REAL-TIME OR NEAR REAL-TIME APPLICATIONS OF GNSS OBSERVATIONS FOR MONITORING STATION POSITIONS FOR DETECTION OF SEISMIC EVENTS AND PROVIDING HAZARD WARNINGS AND MITIGATION OF DAMAGE FROM EARTHQUAKES, VOLCANIC EVENTS, LANDSLIDES, OR TSUNAMI GENERATION. AUTOMATION OF THE PROCESS OF RETRIEVAL OF THE MOST PRECISE EARTH''S ROTATION MATRIX WILL FACILITATE DEVELOPMENT OF REAL-TIME SPACE GEODESY APPLICATIONS."

THE TRADITIONAL VIEW STATES THAT SLOW SOLAR WIND ARISES FROM THE BOUNDARIES OF CORONAL HOLES DUE TO THE LARGER EXPANSION FACTOR. IT IS HARD IN THIS EXPLANATION TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE SLOW WIND OCCUPIES SO MUCH SPACE IN THE HELIOSPHERE. PSEUDOSTREAMERS ARE MULTIPOLAR FEATURES WHICH DEVELOP INTO FIELDS THAT ARE UNIPOLAR AT GREATER HEIGHTS.  THERE IS DEBATE AS TO THE SPEED AND NATURE OF THE WIND FROM PSEUDOSTREAMERS: IT COULD BE FAST, SLOW, OR IN BETWEEN. AND, IN GENERAL, THEY MIGHT FORM A NETWORK OF SLOW WIND WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT CONNECT IN THE HELIOSPHERE TO SLOW WIND COMING FROM AROUND THE HELIOSPHERIC CURRENT SHEET.  DIFFERENT TYPES OF PSEUDOSTREAMERS EXIST, WITH A COMPLEX INNER STRUCTURE WHICH DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER OF POLARITIES EMBEDDED IN THE CLOSED REGIONS BELOW. IN ADDITION PSEUDOSTREAMERS MAY ALSO HARBOR FILAMENT CHANNELS, OFTEN OCCURRING IN PAIRS (TWIN FILAMENT CHANNELS). IN THE LATTER CASE, THE STRONGLY SHEARED FIELD OF THE CHANNEL MAGNETIC STRUCTURES AND THE SKEW OF THE CORONAL ARCADE ABOVE THE CHANNELS DICTATE THE WAY THE CORONAL FIELD EXPANDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF PSEUDOSTREAMERS. WE WILL CALCULATE THE EXPANSION FACTOR ALONG THE PFSS EXTRAPOLATED MAGNETIC FIELD LINES TO INVESTIGATE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PSEUDOSTREAMERS AND WIND SPEED, STUDY HOW THE RESULTING WIND TYPE DEPENDS ON THE GLOBAL CORONAL ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE HEIGHT OF THE PSEUDOSTREAMER NULL POINT, THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF FILAMENT CHANNELS, AND THEREFORE THE EXPANSION OF THE CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE PSEUDOSTREAMER SPINE. WE WILL FOLLOW FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF THE LOW-LATITUDE CORONAL HOLE FROM DECAYING ACTIVE REGIONS IN WHICH PSEUDOSTREAMERS ARE EMBEDDED, STUDY CORONAL CELLS AND FILAMENTS TOPOLOGY AT THE PSEUDOSTREAMER BASES TO DETERMINE THE DIRECTION OF THE TANGENTIAL FIELDS AND CURRENTS IN THE PSEUDOSTREAMER BASES.  WE WILL STUDY THE COMPOSITION AND FLUCTUATION OF THE SOLAR WIND FROM PSEUDOSTREAMERS DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD OF THEIR EVOLUTION FROM FORMATION TO DISSIPATION.  WE WILL ALSO CARRY OUT NUMERICAL MODELS OF THE SOLAR WIND ALONG FIELD LINES CHOSEN FROM POTENTIAL FIELD SOURCE-SURFACE CALCULATIONS EXTRAPOLATED FROM HMI AND MDI MAGNETOGRAMS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SOURCES OF SLOW AND FAST SOLAR WIND FOR THE SOLAR PROBE PLUS MISSION. THE MAGNETIC FIELD EXTRAPOLATED POTENTIALLY TO 2.5 SOLAR RADII WILL BE USED AS A SKELETON ALONG WHICH BOTH STATIONARY AND TIME- DEPENDENT 1D SOLAR WIND MODELS WILL BE CALCULATED TO UNDERSTAND THE SOLAR WIND STRUCTURE IN THE INNER HELIOSPHERE. THE TRANSVERSE PRESSURE STRUCTURE WILL THEN BE ITERATIVELY ADJUSTED (INSIDE 2.5 SOLAR RADII) TO DEVELOP A SEMI-EMPIRICAL THREE DIMENSIONAL MODEL OF THE CORONA AND INNER SOLAR WIND.  FINALLY, WE WILL ALSO PERFORM LOCAL SIMULATIONS OF FIELD POINT MOTIONS IN MODEL PSEUDOSTREAMERS TO SEE THE TYPE AND SPEED OF OUTFLOW GENERATED LOCALLY BY RECONNECTION AT THE PSEUDOSTREAMER FAN/SPINE SURFACE. RECONNECTION AT THE LOCATION OCCURS DUE TO THE ACCUMULATION OF MAGNETIC STRESSES FROM FIELD LINE STRESSING DUE TO THE RANDOM MOTIONS AT THE PHOTOSPHERE. THIS WOULD RELEASE PARTICLES FROM THE CONFINED PLASMA BELOW THE PSEUDOSTREAMER INTO THE SOLAR WIND VIA JETS OF PLASMA ADDING TO THE SOLAR WIND NATURALLY FLOWING ALONG THE OPEN FIELD REGIONS ADJACENT TO THE SPINE."

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS CONTRACT IS TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY RESEARCH FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LIGHTWEIGHT SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNET SYSTEM FOR ACTIVE RADIATION SHIELDING OF A SPACESHIP FOR INTERPLANETARY EXPLORATIONS LIKE EXTENDED MISSIONS TO THE MOON, ASTEROID, AND MARS. TO FACILITATE LAUNCH OF SUCH A SYSTEM, A MODULAR COIL CONCEPT IS REQUIRED THAT ALLOWS ASSEMBLY OF THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS IN SPACE.  THE CONTRACTOR HAS SIX MAIN TASKS. FIRST, THE CONTRACTOR WILL OPTIMIZE A COIL LAYOUT FOR RADIATION SHIELDING. THE SHIELDING EFFICIENCY DEPENDS STRONGLY ON THE LAYOUT OF THE SPACESHIP AND THE SURROUNDING COIL CONFIGURATION. THE COIL LAYOUT WILL BE OPTIMIZED WITH MONTE CARLO ANALYSIS.  THE STUDY WILL CONSIDER AN ARRAY OF DOUBLE-HELIX COILS SURROUNDING THE SPACESHIP WITH ADDITIONAL COIL CONFIGURATIONS IN THE FORWARD AND AFT END OF THE MODULE.   SECOND, THE CONTRACTOR WILL DETERMINE A CONCEPT OF SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNET. DURING THIS TASK THE CONCEPT OF THE REQUIRED COIL WILL BE DEVELOPED.   THIRD, THE CONTRACTOR WILL DEVELOP A CONCEPT FOR CONDUCTOR PLACEMENT. A KEY DESIGN ISSUE OF THE SUPERCONDUCTING TAPE IS ITS MECHANICAL ROBUSTNESS AND ITS MINIMUM BENDING RADII.  FOURTH, THE CONTRACTOR WILL DEVELOP A CONCEPT OF COIL SUPPORT STRUCTURE. THE SUPPORT STRUCTURE OF THE SUPERCONDUCTING COILS HAS TO BE LIGHT AND THE MATERIAL SHOULD MINIMIZE SECONDARY PARTICLE PRODUCTION.  FIFTH, THE CONTRACTOR WILL BUILD A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF THE CRYOGENIC SYSTEM. THE COILS HAVE TO BE KEPT WITHIN A CERTAIN TEMPERATURE RANGE TO GUARANTEE THE SUPERCONDUCTING STATE OF THE CONDUCTOR.  SIXTH, THE CONTRACTOR WILL BUILD A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND SPECIFICATIONS OF THE REQUIRED FLUX PUMP CHARGING SYSTEM. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE SUPERCONDUCTING COILS OPERATE IN A PERSISTENT MODE WITH HIGH OPERATIONAL CURRENTS OF SEVERAL THOUSAND AMPS."

THESE STUDIES YIELD ARCHITECTURES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MASSIVE AND TOO COSTLY TO LAUNCH AND ASSEMBLE IN SPACE. THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO THE MAGNET SIZE AND FIELD STRENGTH REQUIRED TO DEFLECT GALACTIC COSMIC RADIATION (GCR) SPECTRA AND SOLAR PARTICLE EVENTS (SPE) FOR MEANINGFUL CREW PROTECTION IN SPACE. STATE-OF-THE-ART SUPERCONDUCTING TECHNOLOGY HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN PERFORMANCE INCLUDING HIGHER TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTIVITY (HTS) AND GREATER CURRENT CARRYING CAPACITY ALLOWING FOR SIMPLER MAGNET COOLING SYSTEMS AND GREATER MAGNETIC FIELD STRENGTH PER UNIT MASS.  THE WORK PERFORMED UNDER PHASE I SCOPE OF WORK RESULTED IN A HIGHLY FEASIBLE AND DEPLOYABLE RADIATION SHIELD WITH UNPRECEDENTED SIZE AND WEIGHT. DURING THIS FIRST PHASE, AML ANALYZED OVER TWENTY POTENTIAL MAGNET CONFIGURATIONS. THE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT  EXPANDABLE  HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTING (SC) MAGNETS WITH DIAMETERS OF 4M TO 8 M AND LENGTHS OF 15M TO 20 M, ARRANGED IN A 6-AROUND-1 CONFIGURATION PROVIDES AN OPTIMUM SOLUTION AMONG ALL CONFIGURATIONS ANALYZED. EQUALLY IMPORTANT, THE SYSTEM CONCEPT IS AUGMENTED BY A SC COMPENSATION COIL THAT CLOSELY SURROUNDS THE HABITAT INTERCEPTING THERMAL RADIATION AND ELIMINATES THE FRINGE MAGNETIC FIELD FROM THE SHIELDING MAGNETS.    PHASE 2 WILL SUPPORT FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE EXPANDABLE COIL CONCEPT OF SUCH AN ULTRA-LIGHT WEIGHT YET POWERFUL MAGNET STRUCTURE. THIS WILL INCLUDE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE STRUCTURAL LOADS ANALYSIS AND STRUCTURAL DESIGN TO MANAGE THE MAGNETIC FIELD FORCES ON EACH OF THE COILS AND THE HABITAT. CONCEPT DESIGN AND ANALYSIS WILL INCLUDE EFFECTS OF THE COMPENSATION COIL ON THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. ADDITIONAL SUPPORT INCLUDES: SUPPORT TEAM MEMBERS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ANALYZE THE EFFECTS AND TRADEOFFS OF COIL CONFIGURATIONS, MASS, FRINGE FIELDS, AND PERFORMANCE.

While high bypass ratio turbofans brought significant improvements to aircraft propulsion, the future will require the use of a different propulsion technology. Turbo-electric propulsion shows great potential to address all the N+3 objectives through the use of electrically driven fans allowing for distributed propulsion. Turbofans are replaced in this approach by ducted fans driven by high power density electric motors. The electrical power is generated by a gas turbine coupled to a high speed, high power density generator. However, the turbo-electric propulsion concept relies on the availability of electric machines with power densities (kW/m3) and specific power (kW/kg) far larger than that of conventional electric machines. Fully superconducting rotating machines have the potential to match the requirements of turbo-electric propulsion and present enabling technology for this application. Superconducting machines require operation at cryogenic temperature that can be achieved by using closed-cycle cryocoolers or liquid cryogen flow such as liquid hydrogen (LH2) that could also be used as energy carrier for propulsion. The development of turbo-electric propulsion for aircrafts requires accurate sizing of superconducting machines and performing the pertinent trade-off analysis to determine the optimum materials and operating temperature. NASA is currently using sizing models for superconducting machines developed by Dr. and his colleagues. These models were developed as part of the NASA URETI on Aeropropulsion Power and Technology (UAPT) and at the Advanced Magnet Lab (AML). The existing models are based on analytical modeling of electric machines published by Miller and Hughes and estimates of the mass of the different components of the machines assuming a given active length. Important AC loss calculations in this model are based on experimental data available in the literature AC losses in superconducting stators are very challenging to estimate as the rotating field from the rotor is phase shifted relative to the phase current which depends on the angular stator position. Furthermore, the magnitude of the applied field is not uniformly distributed, and the armature reaction tends to demagnetize the machine impacting the AC losses. While the outstanding potential of the turbo-electric propulsion has been successfully demonstrated through a few projects, higher fidelity models are needed to perform a more accurate assessment at the system level. AML proposes to develop the next generation of sizing model based on a complete 3D analysis of superconducting machines using semi-analytical methods to calculate the magnetic flux density distribution including all components of the machine. The model will include all relevant areas of design including electromagnetics, thermodynamics and mechanics. Based on semi-analytical methods, the model will enable rapid calculations as needed for system optimization. The model to be developed will be fully validated, first numerically using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and finally experimentally using a superconducting machine developed at AML. Some aspects of fully superconducting machines including the AC losses and the fault behavior have not been sufficiently studied in the past to build reliable models. We therefore propose to focus the experimental validation on those important aspects: The proposed physics-based model will allow to design and optimize aircrafts based on turbo-electric propulsion, which is the first step towards the development of the next generation of more efficient aircrafts with reduced toxic emissions and noise pollution. Such aircrafts would also allow take-off and landing during the night in cities and would dramatically reduce the cost of operation and maintenance."

INSTITUTIONAL ENGAGEMENT: THE CRITICAL LINK BETWEEN EACH OF THE THREE LINES OF BUSINESS SERVES AS THE CORNERSTONE AND MODEL OF ENGAGEMENT FOR THE COMMUNITIES THAT THE AERO INSTITUTE S EXCITE LEARNING PROJECT WILL IMPACT. THE AERO INSTITUTE WILL LEVERAGE EXISTING COLLABORATIONS TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF EACH PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATION TO DELIVER HIGH QUALITY NASA STEM CONTENT. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE VENTURA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION (VCOE) THE AERO INSTITUTE WILL PROVIDE SYSTEMATIC PROCESS TO INTEGRATE HIGH-QUALITY NASA STEM ACTIVITIES IN ITS YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT KERN, VENTURA, SANTA BARBARA AND SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTIES UTILIZING THE EXCITE LEARNING PROJECT. INFUSING NASA STEM CONTENT (NASA S BEST) ACROSS THE FOUR COUNTY SERVICE-AREA WILL BROADEN THE SCOPE OF IMPACT WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY INCREASING THE ABILITY OF THE AFTER-SCHOOL REGION TO PARTICIPATE IN NASA THEMED STEM ACTIVITIES. THE LIBRARY INITIATIVE FOR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS, OR LIFTS COMPONENT OF THE EXCITE LEARNING PROJECT WILL BROADEN THE SCOPE AND IMPACT OF THE INFUSION OF NASA S EDUCATION MATERIALS AND OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN LOCAL COMMUNITIES. LEVERAGING THE EXISTING COMMUNITY RESOURCES OF LIBRARIES WILL ENABLES EDUCATORS TO EXPLORE A MULTITUDE OF NASA EDUCATION RESOURCES PREPARED FOR INTERACTION WITH EDUCATORS. THE EXCITE LEARNING PROJECT THROUGH IT LIFTS COMPONENT WILL FOSTER COMMUNITY INTEREST, WHILE PROVIDING A  REMOTE  ACCESS SITE FOR EDUCATORS TO RECEIVE NASA EDUCATION CURRICULUM AND MATERIALS. LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT S (LAUSD) BEYOND THE BELL PROGRAM WILL INCREASE THE INFUSION OF NASA STEM CONTENT INTO THEIR AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMMING. NASA EDUCATION MATERIALS ARE BEING USED TO DELIVER DYNAMIC, HANDS-ON ACTIVITIES INQUIRY BASED ENGINEERING DESIGN CHALLENGES FOR K-8 STUDENTS, AND INCREASE BOTH INTEREST AND OUT-OF-SCHOOL INSTRUCTION TIME IN CORE STEM ACADEMICS EDUCATOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT: UTILIZING AERO STAFF TO TRAIN-THE-TRAINERS AT THE COLLABORATING INSTITUTIONS PROVIDES A CONDUIT FOR ON-GOING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT IS ITSELF HANDS-ON INQUIRY BASED USING NASA CURRICULA. EQUIPPING THAT STAFF WITH NASA CURRICULUM, METHODOLOGIES, TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES WILL ENABLE AND EMPOWER THEM TO WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH THE STUDENT POPULATIONS THAT THEY SERVE. STEM ENGAGEMENT: USING THE ABOVE DEVELOPMENT AND NASA CURRICULA, THE EDUCATORS WILL BE BETTER EQUIPPED AND ENABLED TO INTERACT WITH THE PUBLIC AND STUDENTS THROUGH NASA UNIQUE/THEMED STEM PUBLIC EDUCATION ACTIVITIES, EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AND NASA-RELATED STEM DESIGN CHALLENGES THAT ENHANCE INNOVATION, CRITICAL THINKING AND PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS. EDUCATION SPECIALISTS WILL DEVELOP, TEST AND IMPLEMENT EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS BASED ON THE FIELD TRIPS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN AT THE AERO INSTITUTES EXPEDITION LEARNING CENTER (ELC), BUT MODIFIED TO BE CONDUCTED AT THE REMOTE SITE. THE SITE-BASED FIELD TRIPS MAY BE CONDUCTED BY INFORMAL EDUCATION SPECIALISTS, OR BY OTHER NON-NASA FORMAL AND INFORMAL EDUCATORS THAT HAVE RECEIVED APPROPRIATE TRAINING.

THE DWELL MECHANISM ALLOWS FOR DEVIATIONS FROM A SINUSOIDAL DISPLACEMENT PROFILE FOUND IN CRANK-DRIVEN STIRLING ENGINES. LONGER DWELL ALLOWS SLIGHTLY MORE TIME FOR HEAT TRANSFER TO OCCUR IN BOTH THE HOT- AND COLD-SIDE HEAT EXCHANGERS. PRELIMINARY SIMULATIONS USING FREELY AVAILABLE STIRLING ENGINE SIMULATION CODE BY ISRAEL URIELI INDICATES THAT EVEN A MODEST INCREASE IN DWELL TIME INCREASES POWER OUTPUT AND EFFICIENCY. INCREASING THE POWER OUTPUT AND EFFICIENCY OF A STIRLING ENGINE BY WAY OF A SIMPLE MECHANICAL DEVICE REPRESENTS THE ?LOW HANGING FRUIT?

HOWEVER, SOME COMMON DRAWBACKS OF ALL THESE STANDOFF METHODS FOR 3D AIRSPEED SENSING ARE THAT THEY REQUIRE PRECISE ALIGNMENT OF SEPARATE TRANSMITTERS AND RECEIVERS; AND IT IS EXPENSIVE AND UNWIELDY TO EXTEND THESE MEASUREMENTS TO A LARGE ENOUGH VOLUME TO BE PRACTICAL FOR USE IN MEDIUM AND LARGE WIND TUNNELS. THE PROPOSED INSTRUMENT USES RANGE-RESOLVED ELASTIC BACKSCATTER DATA FROM A LIDAR BEAM THAT IS SCANNED OVER THE VOLUME OF INTEREST TO GENERATE A 3D MAP OF AEROSOL DENSITY IN A SHORT TIME SPAN. AEROSOL DENSITY FLUCTUATIONS ARE CROSS-CORRELATED BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE SCANS TO OBTAIN THE DISPLACEMENTS OF THE AEROSOL FEATURES ALONG THE THREE AXES. THEREBY, TEMPORALLY AND SPATIALLY RESOLVED VELOCITY MEASUREMENTS ARE POSSIBLE AT HIGH RESOLUTION. IN PHASE 1, AEROMANCER PROPOSES TO CONDUCT A REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY THE FUNCTIONAL AND OPERATIONAL NEEDS OF WIND TUNNEL APPLICATION AND OF THE INSTRUMENT. A SIGNAL LINK BUDGET ANALYSIS TOOL OF THE PROPOSED LIDAR WILL BE DEVELOPED TO AID IN INSTRUMENT DESIGN AND SCALING. A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF THE INSTRUMENT WILL BE DEVELOPED, WHERE THE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND MAIN COMPONENTS WILL BE IDENTIFIED. THE PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF THE SOFTWARE FOR EXTRACTION OF 3D AIRSPEED INFORMATION FROM THE LIDAR DATA WILL BE DEVELOPED. THE DESIGN STUDIES WILL BE SUPPORTED USING EXPERIMENTAL TESTS WITH A PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED LOWER-FIDELITY PROTOTYPE OF A DIFFERENT CONFIGURATION."

Such an architecture enhances the adaptability and survivability of space systems, while also shortening development timelines and reducing the barrier-to-entry for participation in the national security space industry. The program is predicated on the development of open interface standards-from the physical wireless link layer, through the network protocol stack, and including the real-time resource sharing middleware and cluster flight logic that can enable the emergence of a space global commons which would enhance the mutual security posture of all participants through interdependence. A key program goal is the industry-wide promulgation of these open interface standards for the sustainment and development of future fractionated systems."

THE MODULUS OF TITANIUM IS LOWER THAN LEGACY SPACESUIT BEARING MATERIALS (STAINLESS STEEL). DUE TO THIS, TITANIUM BEARINGS ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DEFLECTION UNDER MAN AND PLUG LOAD SCENARIOS. BEARING DEFLECTION CAUSES A LIMITED NUMBER OF BALLS TO ABSORB THE FULL LOAD AND RESULTS IN HIGHER, LOCALIZED, CONTACT STRESSES. LOCALIZED CONTACT STRESS IS BELIEVED TO BE THE MAIN CONTRIBUTOR TO THE BEARING RACE DEGRADATION OBSERVED DURING NASA\'S 2014 OXYGEN COMPATIBILITY TESTING. IN PHASE 1, WE WILL CORRELATE ANALYTICAL CONTACT STRESS DATA WITH SAMPLE BEARING TEST DATA. THIS CORRELATION WILL CHARACTERIZE BEARING WEAR AND DEGRADATION RELATIVE TO BALL CONTACT STRESS. MULTIPLE TEST ITERATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED TO CLEARLY IDENTIFY THE CONTACT STRESS THAT DEGRADES A TITANIUM RACE. WE WILL ALSO DETERMINE IF THERE ARE COMMERCIAL SURFACE TREATMENTS (COATINGS) THAT MAY ENHANCE TITANIUM WEAR RESISTANCE. AT THE CONCLUSION OF PHASE 1, WE SHALL HAVE IDENTIFIED THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE BEARING CONTACT STRESS. THIS DATA POINT WILL SERVE AS A VALUABLE DESIGN GUIDELINE FOR FUTURE BEARING DESIGNS AND SHOULD YIELD REDUCED CERTIFICATION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS."

IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS OF THESE CHANGES IN THE WATER CYCLE IF WE ARE TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCURATELY PROJECT THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE WARMING AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS ON CIRCUMBOREAL AND ARCTIC ECOSYSTEMS. WE PROPOSE AN INTEGRATED INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH CAMPAIGN TO EVALUATE THE VULNERABILITY OF BOREAL LANDSCAPES TO CHANGE IN THE \PLUMBING\"" THAT CONTROLS WATER MOVEMENT AND DISTRIBUTION, CHANGE IN THE SOURCE AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF C DELIVERED TO INLAND WATERS, AND CHANGE IN THE RATES AND PROCESSES THAT CONTROL ORGANIC AND INORGANIC C PROCESSING BY INLAND WATERS AND THEIR EMISSIONS OF CO2 AND CH4 TO THE ATMOSPHERE. OUR APPROACH RECOGNIZES THAT PERMAFROST THAW WILL NOT ONLY ENHANCE GROUNDWATER FLOW AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUBSURFACE CONNECTIVITY, BUT THAT LOSS OF SUBSURFACE ICE WILL ALSO CHANGE THE STRUCTURE OF THE LAND SURFACE, CREATING THERMOKARST FEATURES IN SOME AREAS AND INITIATING LAKE LOSS OR LAKE CREATION IN OTHERS. IT ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT TERRESTRIAL SOURCES OF C TO INLAND WATERS WILL CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO THAW, FIRE AND OTHER DRIVERS OF CHANGE. THESE CONDITIONS WILL BE EVALUATED BY GEOPHYSICAL AND ECOSYSTEM SURVEYS WITH THE GOAL OF EXTRAPOLATION ACROSS THE BOREAL ABOVE DOMAIN THROUGH REMOTE SENSING ANALYSIS AND MAPPING. GEOPHYSICAL SUBSURFACE PERMAFROST CHARACTERIZATION VIA NEW GROUND AND EXISTING AIRBORNE SURVEYS WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY FRAMEWORK FOR HYDROLOGIC FIELD AND MODELING EFFORTS TO EVALUATE AND PROJECT THE EFFECTS OF CHANGE IN LATERAL CONNECTIVITY ON SURFACE WATER FLOW, GROUNDWATER FLOW, AND LAKE DISTRIBUTION. PERMAFROST THAW ENHANCES GROUNDWATER FLOW, CHANGES THE SEASONAL DISTRIBUTION OF STREAMFLOW, AND ALTERS LAKE BUDGETS. HOWEVER, THE DYNAMICS THAT CONTROL THESE CHANGES ARE NOT COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD, AND CRITICAL BASELINE INFORMATION ON SUBSURFACE PERMAFROST DISTRIBUTION IS TYPICALLY LACKING. USING NEWLY DEVELOPED CAPABILITIES FOR COLD REGIONS, OUR PROPOSED FIELD AND MODELING APPROACHES WILL HELP TO FILL THESE GAPS IN HYDROLOGIC UNDERSTANDING AND WILL ALSO INFORM ON THE ROUTING OF TERRESTRIAL C BY FLOW SYSTEMS TO INLAND WATERS AND THE RESIDENCE TIME OF C IN THOSE SYSTEMS. SOURCE, ROUTING, AND RESIDENCE TIME ARE IMPERATIVE TO UNDERSTANDING C DYNAMICS IN INLAND WATERS. WE WILL DETERMINE C SOURCE AND AGE THROUGH ANALYSES OF THE 14C CONTENT OF INORGANIC AND ORGANIC C SPECIES AND C-GAS EMISSIONS. MOLECULAR BIOMARKERS, COUPLED WITH MEASURED OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF DOC WILL INFORM ON TERRESTRIAL VERSUS AUTOCHTHONOUS SOURCES OF AQUATIC C AND ON ITS POTENTIAL FOR MINERALIZATION BY BIOLOGICAL OR PHOTO- DEGRADATION. MUCH OF TERRESTRIALLY-DERIVED AQUATIC C IS DEGRADED BEFORE REACHING SURFACE WATERS, SO HYDROLOGIC MODELING OF RESIDENCE TIMES WILL IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE AND WHEN INLAND WATER C-GAS EMISSIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE GREATEST. RADIOCARBON AGE OF AQUATIC C WILL FURTHER DELINEATE SOURCE AND INFORM ON IF AND WHERE C DERIVED FROM PERMAFROST OR ANCIENT SOIL SOURCES ARE DELIVERED TO INLAND WATERS. FINALLY, OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF WATER INDICATIVE OF DOC CONCENTRATION AND COMPOSITION WILL BE RELATED TO REMOTELY SENSED LAKE COLOR AND TO THE POTENTIAL FOR C-G S EMISSION, WITH THE GOAL OF EXTRAPOLATING INLAND WATER DOC COMPOSITION AND CO2 AND CH4 EMISSIONS ACROSS THE ABOVE DOMAIN."""

THE TIMING OF IMPACTS ON THE MOON, HOWEVER, IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. IN FACT, THE NATIONAL ACADEMY REPORTED THAT INTERPRETING THIS IMPACT FLUX SHOULD BE ONE OF THE TOP SCIENCE PRIORITIES FOR NASA''S RETURN TO THE MOON (NRC, 2007).  THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON OBTAINING GEOCHEMICAL AND CHRONOLOGICAL DATA ON LUNAR IMPACT GLASSES, WHICH ARE PIECES OF MELTED REGOLITH (LUNAR SOIL) CREATED BY ENERGETIC IMPACTING EVENTS ON THE MOON. THESE IMPACT GLASSES POSSESS THE COMPOSITION OF THE TARGET MATERIAL AND CAN BE DATED BY THE 40AR/39AR (ARGON) METHOD IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THEIR AGE OF FORMATION. UNDERSTANDING THE AGES OF IMPACT GLASSES, ALONG WITH THEIR COMPOSITIONS, ALLOWS FOR A FULL INTERPRETATION OF THE IMPACT HISTORY OF THE MOON, AND FROM THEM, WE CAN BEGIN TO PIECE TOGETHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE RATE OF IMPACT EVENTS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON EARTH.  OVER 500 LUNAR IMPACT GLASSES FROM THREE APOLLO LANDING SITES (APOLLO 14, 16, AND 17) HAVE BEEN ANALYZED GEOCHEMICALLY BY THE PI, AND 70 OF THEM HAVE BEEN DATED BY THE 40AR/39AR METHOD (ALSO BY THE PI). HOWEVER, ONLY A HANDFUL OF IMPACT GLASSES HAVE BEEN STUDIED IN DETAIL SUFFICIENT FOR PUBLICATION IN A PROFESSIONAL JOURNAL (DELANO ET AL. 2007, ZELLNER ET AL. 2009A, ZELLNER ET AL. 2009B). IT IS MY INTENT TO STUDY ADDITIONAL GLASSES IN THE DETAIL REQUIRED FOR SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATION. SEVERAL GLASSES SHOW AGE RELATIONSHIPS THAT MAY COINCIDE WITH SIGNIFICANT SPECIES EXTINCTION EPISODES ON EARTH, AND OTHERS SHOW A GLOBAL LUNAR BOMBARDMENT THAT IS NOT RECORDED IN TERRESTRIAL SEDIMENTS. WHETHER OR NOT ADDITIONAL GLASS AGES CAN BE RECONCILED WITH IMPACT OR EXTINCTION EVENTS, THE DATA ARE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING LUNAR IMPACT PROCESSES IN GENERAL. THE AGES OF ALL ANALYZED GLASSES WILL THUS ADD SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE CURRENT DATA SET OF LUNAR SAMPLE AGES.

ADDITIONALLY, DELIVERY AND PRESERVATION OF ORGANIC MOLECULES, VOLATILES, AND WATER WERE HIGHLIGHTED IN TWO SCIENCE INITIATIVES AT THE NAI STRATEGIC SCIENCE INITIATIVE WORKSHOP IN TEMPE, AZ (MAY 2009).

THIS STUDY PROPOSES TO EXAMINE HOW IMPACT EVENTS MAY CHANGE THE STRUCTURE OF THE SIMPLEST SUGARS, GLYCOLALDEHYDE AND DIHYDROXYACETONE, TWO MOLECULES THAT HAVE BEEN DETECTED IN INTERSTELLAR CLOUDS AND METEORITES, RESPECTIVELY. WE WILL ALSO STUDY HOW THESE IMPACTS AFFECT SUGARS EMBEDDED IN ICE AND MINERAL MATRICES, AS ANALOGS TO COMETS AND METEORITES. WE WILL USE THE FLAT-PLATE ACCELERATOR AT THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER EXPERIMENTAL IMPACT LABORATORY TO INVESTIGATE HOW THESE SUGARS REACT UNDER THE EXTREME PRESSURES AND TEMPERATURES OF SIMULATED TERRESTRIAL IMPACT EVENTS. SHOCKED SOLUTIONS WILL BE ANALYZED BY LC/MS, GC/MS, NMR, AND MALDI-TOFMS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER AND IDENTITY OF THE SPECIES IN THE MIXTURES AND THEN COMPARED TO ANALYSES OF UNREACTED MIXTURES. IT IS LIKELY THAT UNDER THE EXTREME CONDITIONS OF THE SIMULATED IMPACT EVENTS THE SUGARS IN SOLUTION WILL FORM MORE COMPLEX MOLECULES, SUCH AS THREOSE (FORMED FROM THE DIMERIZATION OF GLYCOLALDEHYDE) OR FRUCTOSE (FORMED FROM THE DIMERIZATION OF DIHYDROXYACETONE). THIS OUTCOME WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT TO UNDERSTANDING THE DELIVERY AND SUBSEQUENT SHOCK CHEMISTRY OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOMOLECULES BECAUSE IT WOULD SHOW THAT THESE MOLECULES COULD SURVIVE IMPACT EVENTS TO FORM MORE COMPLEX MOLECULES."

THE TOOL WILL ENABLE ANALYSTS TO IDENTIFY, EARLY IN THE DESIGN PROCESS, POTENTIAL DESIGN, TASK ALLOCATION, OR MISSION PLANNING ISSUES THAT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT ASTRONAUT PERFORMANCE. THE PROPOSED TOOL, SPACEPRINT, WILL LEVERAGE A HUMAN PERFORMANCE MODELING ENVIRONMENT, THE IMPROVED PERFORMANCE RESEARCH INTEGRATION TOOL (IMPRINT), AND TAILOR IT TO SPACE MISSION APPLICATIONS. IMPRINT WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE ARMY RESEARCH LABORATORY, AND IS AVAILABLE, FREE OF CHARGE, TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. IMPRINT INCLUDES ALGORITHMS TO STUDY PERFORMANCE SHAPING FACTORS SUCH AS FATIGUE, TRAINING, AND USE OF PROTECTIVE CLOTHING WITH HUMAN PERFORMANCE MODELS THAT INCLUDE WORKLOAD. SPACEPRINT WILL BE BASED ON AN EXTENSIVE LITERATURE REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS, IN WHICH THE TEAM SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATES HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP RESEARCH AND LESSONS LEARNED TO IDENTIFY AND QUANTIFY FACTORS IN LONG-TERM SPACE MISSIONS THAT AFFECT ASTRONAUT WORKLOAD, FATIGUE, AND PERFORMANCE. THE RESULT OF THIS META-ANALYSIS WILL BE USED TO UPDATE IMPRINT ALGORITHMS SO THEY MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT SPACE-SPECIFIC CONDITIONS. THE TOOL WILL BE DEVELOPED SO IT CAN BE RUN IN A PREDICTIVE MODE, TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE IN MISSIONS THAT ARE BEING PLANNED, AND SO IT CAN RUN IN A LIVE MODE, USING REAL-TIME ASTRONAUT INPUTS ON WORKLOAD, FATIGUE, AND WELLNESS. THE LIVE MODE WILL ALLOW PLANNERS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AS MISSIONS ARE BEING PERFORMED, AND EVALUATE POTENTIAL MITIGATION STRATEGIES. THE TEAM WILL IDENTIFY SCENARIOS OF INTEREST, PERFORM TASK ANALYSES WITH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS (SMES), AND DEVELOP MODELS TO REFLECT THOSE SITUATIONS. SMES WILL REVIEW THE MODELS AND THEIR PREDICTIONS AN EARLY VALIDATION STUDY. THE TEAM WILL ALSO PERFORM AN EMPIRICAL, HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP VALIDATION STUDY. RESULTS OF THE VALIDATIONS WILL BE USED TO REFINE THE MODELS. OUR SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH EFFORTS WILL FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON SITUATIONS THAT RESULT IN WORKLOAD TRANSITIONS (E.G., AUTOMATION FAILURES, OTHER OFF-NOMINAL EVENTS), PLACING THE ASTRONAUTS IN POTENTIAL OVERLOAD SITUATIONS. THESE CONDITIONS, WHEN ADDRESSED BY FATIGUED ASTRONAUTS, CONSTITUTE WORST CASE SCENARIOS AND REQUIRE SPECIFIC, IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION. ONE PARTICULAR GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A PROTOTYPE TOOL THAT IS BOTH USABLE AND USEFUL FOR ANALYSTS, ALLOWING THEM TO EASILY MODIFY SCENARIOS AND EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT FACTORS ON MISSION PERFORMANCE. THIS TOOL WILL PROVIDE DATA ENTRY SCREENS THAT GUIDE THE USER THROUGH THE PROCESS OF BUILDING A SCENARIO. IT WILL ALLOW THE RESEARCHERS TO SPECIFY NUMEROUS RELEVANT FACTORS, E.G., OPERATORS, TASKS, EQUIPMENT, ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, AND SLEEP SCHEDULES. THE OUTPUT OF THE MODEL RUN WILL INCLUDE PARAMETERS OF INTEREST SUCH AS PERCEIVED WORKLOAD, FATIGUE, TIME TO INITIATE TASKS, TIME TO COMPLETE TASKS, TASK ACCURACY, TASK FAILURES (REPRESENTING HUMAN ERROR), RESULTS OF TASK FAILURES, AND OVERALL MISSION SUCCESS."

OF PARTICULAR INTEREST IS A HYBRID CARBON/SIC MATRIX COMPOSITE UTILIZING CARBON FIBER. THIS CLASS OF COMPOSITE, WHICH UTILIZES PHENOLIC PREPREG TO FORM THE INITIAL COMPOSITE STRUCTURE, LENDS ITSELF TO THE FABRICATION OF LARGE VERY COMPLEX STRUCTURES. TYPICALLY, THESE COMPOSITES ARE DENSIFIED VIA PIP PROCESSING. HOWEVER, THERE ARE DEFICIENCIES IN THIS MATERIAL SYSTEM. THE NATURE OF PIP PROCESSING RESULTS IN AN APPRECIABLE AMOUNT OF OPEN POROSITY, REQUIRING A CVD SIC EXTERNAL COATING FOR OXIDATION PROTECTION. THE APPLICATION OF CVD SIC TO LARGE STRUCTURES IS QUITE LIMITED DUE TO COST FACTORS. ALSO, SINCE THE COMPOSITES ARE FABRICATED USING 2D FABRIC, THE TRANSVERSE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES ARE TYPICALLY LOW. THIS PROPOSAL OFFERS A HIGHLY INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO ALLEVIATE THE ABOVE MENTIONED SHORTCOMINGS. FIRST, IT UTILIZES NANOTECHNOLOGY AT THE COMPOSITE MOLDING STAGE, ENABLING ENHANCED IN PLANE AND TRANSVERSE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES. SECONDLY, IT OFFERS A HIGHLY UNIQUE, NON CVD EXTERNAL COATING TECHNOLOGY.

THE FIRST STAGE HAS BEEN CHOSEN BECAUSE MANY CHALLENGES LIE IN ITS DESIGN. BOTH STAGES ARE ASSUMED TO BE SOLID ROCKET MOTORS WITH A PROPELLANT CAPABLE OF LOW TEMPERATURE STORAGE AND OPERATION. THE FIRST STAGE IS THE LARGER OF THE TWO MOTORS, MAKING GRAIN STRESSES MORE PRONOUNCED. IT ALSO UTILIZED THRUST VECTOR CONTROL (TVC), REQUIRING S TVC SYSTEM TO BE ADAPTED FOR THIS APPLICATION. THE SECOND STAGE GUIDANCE IS STILL BEING TRADED BETWEEN SPINNING AND TVC.  THERE IS A STRONG DESIRE TO USE LOW COST, HIGH HERITAGE COMPONENTS WHERE POSSIBLE. THE MAV MUST SURVIVE EARTH LAUNCH, CRUISE TRANSIT, ENTRY DESCENT AND LANDING AS WELL AS MARS SURFACE ENVIRONMENTS.  SEE THE ATTACHED ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (ERD) FOR DETAILED ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIFICATIONS. GENERAL: THE STRAWMAN MAV DESIGN ASSUMES THAT IT WILL BE LOWERED TO THE SURFACE OF MARS ON A HERITAGE, SKY-CRANE LANDER.  PROPELLANT MASS IS BASED ON A METASTUDY OF #tilde#20 YEARS OF SOLID PROPELLANT MAV DESIGNS. THE CURRENT MAXIMUM OUTER DIAMETER (NOT INCLUDING RCS OR CONNECTION ADAPTERS) IS ASSUMED TO BE 15 INCHES AND THE MAXIMUM STAGE 1 MOTOR LENGTH IS 0.9M. REDUCTIONS IN ENVELOPE ARE DESIRABLE AS THESE ARE PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES OF THE GEOMETRY. ALL MASSES HAVE ASSUMED A CURRENT BEST ESTIMATE PLUS 43% MARGIN. WHILE THIS CONTINGENCY MAY SEEM HIGH FOR A SOLID ROCKET MOTOR, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE SYSTEM DESIGN WILL REQUIRE ANY ADDITIONAL MARGIN PROVIDED BY THE PROPULSION SYSTEM. IT IS ASSUMED THAT ANY RESIDUAL MARGIN WILL BE COMPENSATED FOR BY OFFLOADING PROPELLANT (<20%) OR ADDING BALLAST."

CURRENTLY, THE ONLY AVAILABLE MEASUREMENT OF ICP IS A POSTFLIGHT OPENING PRESSURE VIA LUMBAR PUNCTURE (LP). GIVEN THE INVASIVENESS OF LP AND THE RELUCTANCE TO UTILIZE IT IN THE ABSENCE OF CLINICAL INDICATIONS, ICP ELEVATIONS ARE YET TO BE CONSISTENTLY DOCUMENTED IN CREWMEMBERS. IN ADDITION, THE CAUSE FOR ICP ELEVATION IN-FLIGHT HAS NOT YET BEEN ESTABLISHED. CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS OF THE VIIP SYNDROME MAINLY FOCUS ON THE VASCULAR AND INTERSTITIAL COMPONENTS OF THE CEPHALAD FLUID REDISTRIBUTION. AN OVERLOOKED COMPONENT OF FLUID SHIFT THAT THIS STUDY WILL EVALUATED IS THE REDISTRIBUTION OF CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) IN THE CRANIOSPINAL SYSTEM AND ITS EFFECT ON ICP. AS THE CRANIUM CONTAINS MORE CSF THAN BLOOD, THIS COMPONENT OF FLUID SHIFT MAY BE A LARGER CONTRIBUTOR TO ICP ELEVATIONS THAN THE VASCULAR/INTERSTITIAL COMPONENTS. THE POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN SPINAL CANAL COMPLIANCE BUFFERING DUE TO SPINAL ELONGATION MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO ICP ELEVATIONS AS WELL.THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL UTILIZE SPECIALIZED MRI SEQUENCES, COLLECTED ON 7 SHORT-DURATION AND 10 LONG-DURATION CREWMEMBERS, TO ASSESS CSF HYDRODYNAMICS AND VASCULAR HEMODYNAMICS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO VIIP. KEY PARAMETERS THAT WILL BE ANALYZED INCLUDE TOTAL CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW, VENOUS DRAINAGE, INTRACRANIAL COMPLIANCE AND PRESSURE AS WELL AS CRANIO-SPINAL COMPLIANCE DISTRIBUTION. THESE VALUES WILL BE CORRELATED WITH CHANGES IN VISUAL/OCULAR FUNCTION AND MORPHOLOGY, AND MEASURES OF SPINAL ELONGATION. EFFECTS OF MISSION DURATION WILL BE ELUCIDATED BY COMPARING SHORT AND LONG-DURATION CREWMEMBERS. THESE ANALYSES WILL ELUCIDATE THE ROLE OF CEPHALAD CSF SHIFT IN THE ETIOLOGY OF VIIP, WILL DEFINE HYDRODYNAMIC MEASURES THAT MAY PREDICT SUSCEPTIBILITY TO VIIP, AND MAY LEAD TO IDENTIFICATION OF NOVEL COUNTERMEASURES. THIS STUDY WILL BE CONSTRAINED BY THE NUMBER OF SUBJECT MRIS AVAILABLE FOR ANALYSIS, COMPARED WITH AN OPTIMAL TERRESTRIAL STUDY WHERE MORE SUBJECTS WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR STUDY."

This continuation project builds upon more than a decade of the ACCESS project, during which AAAS recruited, screened, placed and followed up on a diverse group of talented students with disabilities at 10 NASA sites around the country, and NASA/Headquarters in Washington, DC. The recruitment of a high level of talent and the need for increased diversity of students entering the NASA pipeline has fostered a request by NASA sites for more summer interns with disabilities. This proposal requests funding for placement of a minimum of 20 undergraduate and graduate students with disabilities, majoring in science, mathematics, physics, technology, engineering, and some business areas. The interns will represent diverse cultural, gender, geographic, and academic backgrounds, in nine NASA centers and Headquarters for 10-week summer internships."

The program has actually been supported by NASA since 1980 in an initial grant and series of single year grant supplements. The program is advertised by the American Astronomical Society as the AAS Small Research Grants Program. A web page is available with details on how to apply and file final reports at http:Uwww.aas.org/grants/smrg.php. Twice each year, proposals are received and reviewed (the review used to take place at AAS meetings; it is now done by teleconference with materials distributed electronically to broaden the potential referee pool and economize). The goal of the program is to take some administrative burden from NASA for small, unsolicited proposals while generating the maximum scientific return. The proposals may cover the support of travel to observatories, computer costs, page charges, and other purposes related to individual research projects. The proposals are peer reviewed by an AAS committee and the AAS administers the award to the individual scientists. In past years, the AAS solicited proposals from individual astronomers for support of research ranging in amount from $300 to $5,000; in 1998 the average value of the 19 grants was just over $3,500. Subsequent years have similar averages. Although we received permission in 2000 to increase the maximum award to $7,000 from our program officer, we opted to wait until we received the 2004 grant before implementing this change. This cap now adequately meets the needs of all reasonable proposals and we plan to keep this cap in place for the duration of this grant. The program has been tremendously successful, with numerous papers published from results obtained with program funding. Additionally, the program funds research travel, research equipment costs (such as computers) and also supports innovative requests involving public outreach or community support (such as the production of the American Association of Variable Star Observers finder chart CDROM). More detailed information on the amount of grants awarded and some program highlights under the program from 2004 to 2008 are given below. Astronomers don''t just find employment at major universities or research institutions. They work at smaller colleges, in the private sector and even at community colleges. In this environment it is difficult to maintain a research presence, so necessary in all realms of physical science. One prerequisite for excellence in teaching-at all levels-is active participation in research. This experience enables the astronomer to contribute to and maintain current knowledge about the field. Many smaller or less-endowed schools do not have the means, ability or tradition for supporting faculty research. The American Astronomical Society has always and will continue to actively support research experience for all its members. In an era of constrained research support it is lmportant to foster a wide variety of research projects. Funding agencies are inundated with requests to sponsor all manner of projects, large and small. The large projects are the most economically feasible to process and manage by government agencies. Unfortunately, only limited resources are usually available for small grants, of a few thousand dollars and many government proposal review processes mix very small grants in with normal and large requests, disadvantaging the small requestors. Despite their small size, grants of this amount have a remarkable potential to produce excellent science, especially for those researchers at smaller institutions or who are just starting out. These requests often represent the work of the astronomer in a small facility or those in a larger institution who need a lower level of support. It is important to reach these scientists, who represent an important segment of the American astronomical community. The succ  "

THESE CHANGES ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE PLACE BECAUSE OF THE CONSTANT STATE OF TURNOVER THAT CHARACTERIZES SKELETAL MUSCLE, WHICH PERMITS MUSCLE TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN EXTERNAL LOADING BY INCREASING, DECREASING, OR MAINTAINING MUSCLE MASS. SPACEFLIGHT, AS WELL AS THE GROUND-BASED ANALOGS, I.E., BED-REST AND RODENT HINDLIMB UNLOADING, LEAD TO A LOSS OF WEIGHT IN ANTIGRAVITY MUSCLES SUCH AS THE SOLEUS THAT IS NOTICEABLE WITHIN TWO DAYS AND IS THE RESULT OF AN IMBALANCE IN MUSCLE PROTEIN-TURNOVER (3, 4, 5, 6). THIS IMBALANCED MUSCLE PROTEIN-TURNOVER IS DESCRIBED AS A REDUCTION IN MUSCLE PROTEIN SYNTHESIS AND AN UPREGULATION OF MUSCLE PROTEIN DEGRADATION. DURING SKELETAL MUSCLE DISUSE, A REGULATOR OF PROTEIN-TURNOVER IS THE ACTIVATION OF THE UBIQUITIN PROTEASOME PATHWAY, WHICH IS THE PRIMARY MODE OF MUSCLE PROTEIN DEGRADATION (7). THE UBIQUITIN PROTEASOME PATHWAY TARGETS THE MYOFIBRIL PROTEINS THAT MAKE UP THE MYOFIBRIL FRACTION, SUCH AS MYOSIN HEAVY CHAIN (MHC), ACTIN, AND TROPOMYOSIN, ALL OF WHICH ARE INTEGRAL COMPONENTS OF THE CONTRACTI LE APPARATUS AND INVOLVED IN FORCE DEVELOPMENT AND MUSCLE CONTRACTION (6, 7). LESSENING THE EXTERNAL LOAD PLACED ON THE MUSCLE, AS WITH  MICROGRAVITY EXPOSURE OR HINDLIMB UNLOADING, WILL ALSO ALTER THE COMPOSITION OF MUSCLE FIBERS, LEADING TO A TRANSITION FROM THE SLOW, ANTIGRAVITY PHENOTYPE TO A FASTER ISOFORM MUSCLE FIBER (8, 9). TOGETHER, THESE CHANGES LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN FUNCTION CHARACTERIZED BY DECREASED FORCE OUTPUT, POWER OUTPUT, AND DECREASED STAMINA.  REDUCED MUSCLE FUNCTION CAN BE DETRIMENTAL TO ASTRONAUTS DURING SPACEFLIGHT AND ALSO UPON RETURN FROM THE MICROGRAVITY ENVIRONMENT TO THE 19 ENVIRONMENT OF EARTH."

The parts of the two-year project are:  Development of an online professional development handbook of NASA content for lead teachers to use in conducting workshops for peers and establishment of a national professional development network of lead teachers prepared to deliver workshops in NASA content for their peers in grades 6-12.  Incorporation of NASA science and technology content into AGI's middle and high school nationally distributed Earth science curricula. Promotion of Parts 1 and 2 of the program through  outreach programs such as Earth Science Week (ESW), Earth magazine, Earth Science World web site, the geoscientists comprising  membership and through  outreach efforts.  The anticipated results from this project are: 1. Increased use of NASA's geoscience, technology, engineering and mathematics content in secondary classrooms nationwide. This will result from three major efforts: a. Local workshops on NASA content conducted by a cadre of 100 lead teachers from across the U.S. (50 teachers each year over the two years of the project). These lead teachers, all of whom have already received extensive training and follow-up by  in both geoscience content and in conducting workshops, will receive both the materials and the training to conduct NASA workshops in their local school districts. b.

Both , who will develop the guide, are extremely familiar with NASA's STEM education efforts. has worked with NASA as an Earth Science Week partner for many years and has promoted NASA's programs annually through the ESW kits, web site and press releases.  is among the nation's top centers of NASA research, having the lead role or a principal collaborating role in most of NASA's missions to Mars over the past two decades, and currently serving as lead institution for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera.  c. Nationally distributed secondary Earth science curricula that have been revised to include NASA geoscience content. These curricula, Investigating Earth Systems (IES) for middle school and EarthComm for high school, were originally developed by  with National Science Foundation support and commercially published in 2001/2002. They are undergoing revision over academic years 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 to update content, as well as to incorporate new investigations and technologies. Working with ASU SESE to incorporate NASA geoscience content into the revised curricula will ensure that this content will reach students and teachers throughout the U.S. NASA funding support is not requested for this revision effort. It is an in-kind contribution from the to support NASA's STEM education efforts.  2. Increased visibility for NASA's geoscience, technology, engineering and mathematics content in secondary classrooms nationwide.  This will occur through promotion of the training program and revised curricula through AGI's and ASU SESE's outreach efforts. "

Through its unique position as the sole organization in the United States comprised of all of the nation's 36 TCUs, AIHEC will implement a series of proven-effective recruitment, retention, and career development strategies that will ultimately broaden the diversity of institution types and number of high performing American Indian students and faculty members who annually participate in NASA's internship and fellowship application pool. To further strengthen and expand NASA's outreach to institutions that serve the majority of this nation's underserved students, AIHEC plans to coordinate this proposal with similar proposals to be submitted by the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education (NAFEO) and the Hispanic College Fund (NCF). Combined, the institutions represented by AIHEe, NAFEO and HeF educate more than one-third of all students of color in the United States. AIHEC proposes to: establish and foster a community of interest among TCU students and faculty focusing on NASA science; identify and recruit TCU students for involvement in NASA internship and fellowship programs; supplement the educational and career development programming of TCUs using NASA education, research, and workforce development resources; and establish an online project portal for collaboration among our Broker/Facilitator partner institutions."

Sub-micron mineral dust, still present in the fine-grained matrix of meteorites, coagulated and melted to form macroscopic clasts: once-molten Mg-silicate chondrules; the oldest solar system rocks, Ca-, Al-rich inclusions (CAIs); amoeboid-olivine-aggregates (AOAs). Different meteorite types (i.e., parent bodies) contain distinct abundances and sizes of chondrules and CAIs and their chemical and textural subtypes. We request support to measure the abundances, sizes, chemical compositions, and detailed crystallization histories of the objects (chondrules, CAIs, AOAs) that accreted together to form the most primitive meteorites. We will use this information in collaboration with astrophysical modelers to understand how these objects may have been formed and sorted into the different meteorite classes, and how that process bears on planet formation. Using previous support, we developed new techniques of 3D imaging, x-ray mapping and image analysis. We showed that existing abundance and size data collected long ago are not correct. We will address these questions with our measurements: What were the temperature, pressure, and volatile element distributions, local mixing and transport dynamics, and accretion chronologies during chondrite formation? Were high-temperature objects formed near the sun and transported outward? How did they mix in just the right proportions to yield different meteorite types, all with very similar overall chemical compositions? We also propose to use serial thin sectioning with a 30 micron wire saw to allow us to explore in unprecedented detail the crystallization histories and chemical, isotopic evolution during cooling of the oldest objects formed in the solar system: CAIs and AOAs. We will apply similar techniques, and 3D imaging, to find and explore layered chondrules that show evidence of repeated heating events in space before accretion. We will then apply state-of-the-art thermodynamic models to the chemical and isotopic data, in modeling how these objects formed in space. Finally, we will apply the same modeling tools to understanding the conditions of formation of minerals discovered in comet samples returned by the Stardust mission. These studies, together, bear directly on outstanding problems in cosmochemistry, at the interfaces between astrophysical theories, observations of far-away disks, and study of samples here on Earth."

WE WILL DEVELOP NEW CAPABILITIES USING OUR NEW LSM 710 CONFOCAL MICROSCOPE INSTALLED IN 2010. WE CAN SEE AEROGEL FLUORESCENCE IN BACKGROUND AEROGEL, AND REFLECTANCE FROM ALL SOLID GRAINS, ALL IN 34 CHANNELS OF IMAGE WAVELENGTHS. OUR GOALS INCLUDE USING OPTICAL METHODS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN COMETARY PARTICLES AND MELTED AEROGEL CAPTURE MEDIUM, AND COMBINING OUR RESULTS WITH SIMILAR IMAGING OF ANALOG TRACKS WITH KNOWN IMPACTORS, AND DEVELOPING MODELS OF HYPERVELOCITY IMPACTS IN AEROGEL. SUCH MODELS WILL ALLOW US TO INFER THE ORIGINAL POROSITY, MASS, AND VOLATILE CONTENT OF GRAINS FROM COMET 81P/WILD 2, CAPTURED IN AEROGEL TILES BY THE STARDUST MISSION. THESE ARE THE FIRST SOLID SAMPLES RETURNED TO EARTH FROM AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL BODY SINCE THE APOLLO ERA. LCSM ALLOWS RAPID 3D IMAGING OF COMPLETE COMET GRAIN TRACKS IN AEROGEL KEYSTONES AT #tilde#80 NM LATERAL SPATIAL RESOLUTION, AND #tilde#300 NM RESOLUTION ALONG THE OPTICAL AXIS, ALL ON A BENCH-TOP INSTRUMENT AT THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.

THIS IS NECESSARY TO CORRECT FOR MINOR DISTORTION OF REFLECTED LIGHT ALONG THE OPTICAL AXIS OF THE MICROSCOPE. OUR IMAGE ANALYSIS YIELDS HIGHLY ACCURATE 3D TRACK GEOMETRY, GRAIN SIZE AND GRAIN DISTRIBUTION. THE XRF ANALYSIS AT 1-5 MICRON/PIXEL TELLS US WHERE COMETARY GRAINS ARE, AND THE LOCATION OF POTENTIALLY HIGH-PRIORITY GRAINS. ALL THIS WORK CAN BE DONE PRIOR TO DESTRUCTIVE FLATTENING OF TRACKS, OR GRAIN REMOVAL. OUR IMAGING CAN BE DONE ON INTACT TRACKS EVEN AFTER REMOVAL OF LARGE TERMINAL PARTICLES. IMAGE DATA REMAIN ACCESSIBLE FOR FURTHER POST-PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS. THIS WORK IS FUNDAMENTAL TO NASA GOALS FOR MAXIMUM STARDUST DATA RETRIEVAL FOR UNDERSTANDING SOLAR SYSTEM ORIGINS. OUR GOAL IS TO IMAGE AS MANY TRACKS AS POSSIBLE AT USING LCSM, AND MAP GRAIN CHEMISTRY USING 2-D OR STEREO-PAIR XRF IMAGING. THIS SUITE OF 3D-DATA ADDS STATISTICAL POWER TO ANALYSES OF THE WHOLE SUITE OF DUST ENTRY PATHS, AND GRAIN FRAGMENTATION SYSTEMATICS. OUR COMBINED LCSM+XRF RESULTS WILL REVEAL LOCATIONS OF GRAINS WITH INTERESTING CHEMICAL COMPOSITIONS, PARTICULARLY SMALLER ONES IN TRACK BULBS.

THIS DISCOVERY OF AREAS RICH IN (MG,FE)-AL SPINEL ON THE RIMS AND CENTRAL PEAKS OF LUNAR IMPACT HAS REVIVED THE OLD PUZZLE OF THE ORIGIN OF LUNAR SPINEL. HOWEVER, THE ORIGIN AND MECHANISM(S) OF FORMATION OF SUCH SPINEL-RICH ROCKS ARE NOT CLEAR. IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTUAL SPINELRICH SAMPLES FROM THE MOON, VERIFICATION OF THE VALIDITY OF ANY HYPOTHESIS OF ORIGIN WILL REMAIN SPECULATIVE. TO DATE, ONLY ONE SPINELRICH MATERIAL HAS BEEN DESCRIBED IN A METEORITE SAMPLE (GROSS ET AL., 2011; GROSS AND TREIMAN, 2011). CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS CRITICAL TO ANALYZE THIS FRAGMENT AND ADDITIONAL SPINEL-BEARING ROCKS FROM THE LUNAR HIGHLAND CRUST, IN DETAIL BY PETROGRAPHY, MINERAL CHEMISTRY, LIQUIDUS/CRYSTALLIZATION EXPERIMENTS, AND SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE OF THE EXPERIMENTAL RUN PRODUCTS. SUCH ANALYSES WILL PROVIDE CONSTRAINTS ON THE PETROGENESIS OF SPINEL-RICH ROCKS ON THE MOON, AND OFFER VALUABLE INSIGHTS INTO SPINEL-RICH MATERIAL THAT WILL PROVIDE A MORE DIVERSE DATASET USABLE AS GROUND TRUTH BOTH FOR CALIBRATION AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SPINEL-RICH REFLECTANCE SPECTRA OBSERVED BY M3. THE LONG-TERM GOALS IN THIS RESEARCH ARE: (1) TO PROVIDE CONSTRAINTS ON THE ORIGIN AND FORMATION HISTORY(S) OF MG-AL SPINEL-RICH AND SPINEL-BEARING LUNAR HIGHLAND SAMPLES AND THUS TO PROVIDE IMPORTANT NEW CLUES FOR THE COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE LUNAR CRUST AND (2) TO OFFER A CRUCIAL LINK BETWEEN THE SMALL-SCALE PERSPECTIVE OF ROCKS AND METEORITES AND THE GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE OF ORBITAL REMOTE SENSING.

THEIR FORMATION REQUIRES RAPID HEATING TO TEMPERATURES OF AROUND 1800 K, FOLLOWED BY COOLING AT RATES OF AROUND 1000 K/HOUR, FAR SLOWER THAN THE FREE-SPACE COOLING TIME OF SUCH MILLIMETER-SIZED OBJECTS. IDENTIFYING THE MECHANISM FOR THIS UBIQUITOUS HEATING AND COOLING HAS REMAINED A PROBLEM FOR OVER A CENTURY. SIMILAR HIGH-TEMPERATURE MINERALS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN INTERPLANETARY DUST OF COMETARY ORIGIN, AND OBSERVED TRANSITIONS FROM AMORPHOUS TO CRYSTALLINE SILICATE SUGGEST HIGH-TEMPERATURE PROCESSING OF DUST IN OTHER PROTOPLANETARY DISKS. THE SHORT CIRCUIT INSTABILITY THAT WE HAVE RECENTLY DISCOVERED INTERMITTENTLY HEATS PROTOPLANETARY DISKS, PRODUCING THIN SHEETS HOT ENOUGH TO SATISFY THESE CONSTRAINTS. WE PROPOSE TO DETERMINE THE ROLE OF THIS INSTABILITY IN MINERAL FORMATION IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS. MELTING A LARGE FRACTION OF THE SOLIDS IN A PROTOPLANETARY DISK REQUIRES A SUBSTANTIAL SOURCE OF ENERGY. THE SHORT-CIRCUIT INSTABILITY CAN TAP THE HUGE RESERVOIR CONTAINED IN THE DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION OF THE DISK. PROTOPLANETARY DISKS MUST HAVE A VISCOSITY FAR EXCEEDING MOLECULAR VISCOSITY TO ACCRETE GAS AT THE RATES OBSERVED IN YOUNG STELLAR OBJECTS. THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE OF THIS VISCOSITY IS MAGNETIZED TURBULENCE DRIVEN BY THE MAGNETOROTATIONAL INSTABILITY (MRI) WHEREVER THE DISK IS ADEQUATELY IONIZED. MAGNETIZED TURBULENCE QUITE GENERALLY FORMS SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY INTERMITTENT CURRENT SHEETS THAT DISSIPATE THE MAGNETIC ENERGY AS HEAT. THESE CAN RAISE THE GAS TEMPERATURE LOCALLY WELL BEYOND ITS VOLUME AVERAGE.  IF TEMPERATURES REACH 1000 K, GAS RESISTIVITY STARTS TO FALL SHARPLY AS ALKALI METALS ARE THERMALLY IONIZED. OVER THE RANGE FROM 1000 K TO 2000 K, THE RESISTIVITY DECREASES BY MORE THAN 5 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. IN THAT TEMPERATURE RANGE, THE RESISTIVE EVOLUTION OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS DOMINATED BY THE SPATIAL VARIATION IN THE RESISTIVITY. SIMILARLY TO ELECTRICAL SHORT CIRCUITS AND LIGHTNING, THE ELECTRICAL CURRENTS IN THE DISK CONCENTRATE IN HOT, HIGH CONDUCTIVITY REGIONS, LEADING TO STRONG RESISTIVE HEATING IN NARROW SHEETS. WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THIS INSTABILITY CAN OCCUR IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS, EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF RADIATIVE COOLING. IN SOME CASES THE GAS IN OUR MODELS REACHES TEMPERATURES HIGH ENOUGH TO FORM CHONDRULES AND OTHER SIMILAR MINERALS.  WE PROPOSE TO FIND THE GAS AND GRAIN TEMPERATURES REACHED IN CURRENT SHEETS DRAWN DIRECTLY FROM MRI TURBULENCE. WE WILL USE LARGESCALE MODELS OF CURRENT SHEET FORMATION BY THE MRI TO SET THE STAGE FOR SMALL-SCALE MODELS OF INDIVIDUAL CURRENT SHEETS. THE MRI MODELS WILL USE THE PENCIL CODE TO CHARACTERIZE CURRENT SHEETS IN STRATIFIED, SHEARING-BOX SIMULATIONS WITHOUT TEMPERATURE DEPENDENT RESISTIVITY, AND IN HIGHER-RESOLUTION, UNSTRATIFIED SIMULATIONS WITH IT. TO IMPROVE OUR MODELING OF THE GAS RESISTIVITY AND THE MRI WE WILL USE A CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM CODE TO CALCULATE THE IONIZATION FRACTION IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS: THE ALKALI METALS CAN BE LOCKED AWAY IN SOLID MINERALS, PREVENTING THEIR THERMAL IONIZATION. TOGETHER THESE MODELS WILL PROVIDE THE INITIAL AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR SIMULATIONS OF INDIVIDUAL CURRENT SHEETS USING A PURPOSE-BUILT IMPLICIT CODE INCLUDING RADIATIVE TRANSFER AS WELL AS TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT RESISTIVITY. HISTORIES OF THE GAS TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE, AND THE AMBIENT RADIATION, SAMPLED USING LAGRANGIAN TRACER PARTICLES, WILL ALLOW US TO USE THE EQUILIBRIUM CONDENSATION CODE TO COMPARE THE EXPERIENCE OF SOLIDS IN OUR SIMULATIONS WITH EXPERIMENTAL CONSTRAINTS ON CHONDRULES AND OTHER HIGH-TEMPERATURE MINERALS. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS THAT THE SHORT CIRCUIT INSTABILITY CAN PRODUCE GRAIN THERMAL HISTORIES CONSISTENT WITH EXPERIMENTAL AND OBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE ENSEMBLE OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE MINERALS IN OUR OWN AND EXTERNAL DISKS."

THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED USING A TWO-PRONGED APPROACH ADDRESSING BOTH DEVICE DESIGN AND MATERIALS. FIRST, THE CONVENTIONAL PN PHOTODIODE DEVICE IS REPLACED WITH A NEW DEVICE STRUCTURE, THE NBN DETECTOR, WHICH INHERENTLY SUPPRESSES PERFORMANCE-LIMITING DARK CURRENTS, SUCH AS THOSE PRODUCED BY SURFACE LEAKAGE. SECOND, HIGHLY MANUFACTURABLE III-V MATERIALS ARE USED, WHICH ARE FURTHER ENHANCED WITH AMETHYST''S PROPRIETARY UV HYDROGENATION DEFECT MITIGATION PROCESS. THE RESULT IS A LOW COST, HIGH PERFORMANCE DETECTORS OPERATING IN THE 2   5 MICRON WAVELENGTH REGION. THERE IS A PRESSING NEED FOR ULTRA-HIGH SENSITIVITY DETECTORS OPERATING IN THIS REGION FOR THE DETECTION OF TRACE GASES AND CHEMICALS. IN PHASE I AMETHYST PRODUCED A 2.8 MICRON CUTOFF DETECTOR. THE PROGRAM MET ALL OBJECTIVES, DEMONSTRATING CONSIDERABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN PERFORMANCE OVER CONVENTIONAL PN DIODES USING THE NBN AND HYDROGENATION APPROACH. IN PHASE II, AMETHYST WILL DESIGN, FABRICATE AND TEST HIGH PERFORMANCE DETECTORS INDIVIDUALLY OPTIMIZED WITH CUTOFF WAVELENGTHS THROUGHOUT 2 5 MICRON WAVELENGTH RANGE. THESE DETECTORS WILL HAVE IMPROVED DETECTIVITY, AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED COOLING REQUIREMENTS COMPARED TO CURRENTLY AVAILABLE COMMERCIAL DETECTORS. IN ADDITION, AMETHYST WILL DELIVER A THERMOELECTRICALLY COOLED 3.3 MICRON WAVELENGTH CUTOFF DETECTOR TO JPL''S MICRODEVICES LABORATORY FOR COMPARATIVE TESTING AND TO ASSIST IN DEVELOPMENT OF METHANE DETECTOR SYSTEMS. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE II IS TO ESTABLISH PERFORMANCE METRICS, MANUFACTURING PROCESS, CHARACTERIZE AND LIFE TEST SINGLE ELEMENT DEVICES. THESE EFFORTS WILL HELP ESTABLISH A US BASED MANUFACTURING SOURCE OF THESE ULTRA-HIGH PERFORMANCE DETECTORS."

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF RECENT MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION AND GEODETIC ACCURACY OF LUNAR TOPOGRAPHIC DATA AS A BASIS FOR CALCULATIONS TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE SELENOLOCATION OF THE M3 DATA. ROOT-MEAN-SQUARED (RMS) POSITIONAL ERRORS WILL BE REDUCED FROM #tilde#200 M RELATIVE AND 450 M ABSOLUTE TO ON THE ORDER OF A PIXEL (140 M) OR BETTER, AND THE NUMEROUS IMAGES WITH GROSS POSITIONAL ERRORS OF KILOMETERS WILL BE CORRECTED. SECONDARILY, SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC ACCURACY WILL BE IMPROVED THROUGH THE USE OF A MUCH MORE DETAILED TOPOGRAPHIC MODEL IN PHOTOMETRIC CORRECTIONS AND MORE ACCURATE REGISTRATION TO THIS MODEL. TWO DATASETS WILL BE USED: (1) DIGITAL DATA FROM THE M3 PDS ARCHIVE, INCLUDING HYPERSPECTRAL DATA FROM TWO MAJOR OPTICAL IMAGING PERIODS, ANCILLARY DATA INCLUDING SPICE KERNELS, SELENOLOCATION FILES, AND ENGINEERING DATA SUFFICIENT TO REPRODUCE AND IMPROVE UPON EARLIER RAY-TRACING RESULTS (BOARDMAN ET AL., 2011; GREEN ET AL., 2011); AND (2) THE FULL-RESOLUTION (#tilde#100 M/PIXEL) DIGITAL TERRAIN MODEL (DTM) DERIVED FROM STEREO IMAGING OF THE WIDE ANGLE CAMERA (WAC) INSTRUMENT ON THE LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (E.G., SCHOLTEN ET AL., 2011). THE WORK CONSISTS OF FIVE MAJOR TASKS: (1) SYSTEMATIC REPROCESSING OF THE FULL DATASET THROUGH THE MISSION-DEVELOPED LEVEL 1B PROCESSING PIPELINE USING THE WAC DTM TO GREATLY IMPROVE SELENOLOCATION ACCURACY; (2) DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE TOOLS FOR PROCESSING M3 DATA ''MOST IMPORTANTLY, A PHYSICALLY RIGOROUS CAMERA MODEL'' IN THE USGS ISIS3; (3) USE OF THE ADVANCED CAPABILITIES OF ISIS TO CONTROL THE GLOBAL M3 DATASET WITH IMPROVED ACCURACY AND GENERATE FURTHER IMPROVED LEVEL 1B PRODUCTS; (4) SYSTEMATIC REPROCESSING OF BEST VERSION OF LEVEL 1B DATA THROUGH THE MISSION DEVELOPED LEVEL 2 PROCESSING PIPELINE USING THE WAC DTM TO GREATLY IMPROVE PHOTOMETRIC ACCURACY; (5) GENERATION OF A COMPLETE SET OF ORTHORECTIFIED AND MOSAICKED (LEVEL 3) DATA PRODUCTS INCLUDING PHOTOMETRICALLY NORMALIZED SPECTRA AND SPECTRAL PARAMETER MAPS; AND (6) DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS, WITH INTERIM RESULTS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE ONLINE AND FINAL SPICE KERNELS, LEVEL 1B AND LEVEL 3 PRODUCTS FORMALLY ARCHIVED TO THE IMAGING NODE OF THE PLANETARY DATA SYSTEM (PDS). THE MULTIPLE PRODUCTS GENERATED BY THIS EFFORT WILL SERVE THE BROADEST POSSIBLE SET OF SCIENTIFIC APPLICATIONS OF THE M3 DATASET. LEVEL 1B PRODUCTS, WHICH ARE NOT SPATIALLY RESAMPLED, ARE ESSENTIAL OR STUDIES REQUIRING THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE SPECTRAL FIDELITY, AND THE IMPROVED SELENOLOCATION ACCURACY OF OUR RESULTS WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PHOTOMETRIC NORMALIZATION OF THESE DATA AND FACILITATE COMPARISON WITH OTHER DATASETS. THE RESAMPLED LEVEL 3 PRODUCTS WILL GREATLY SIMPLIFY THE USE OF M3 FOR REGIONAL STUDIES IN WHICH SUMMARY SPECTRAL CHARACTERISTICS SUFFICE. FINALLY, THE COMBINATION OF A FULL SET OF ISIS TOOLS PLUS IMPROVED SPICE DATA WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR USERS WHOSE SPECIAL NEEDS ARE NOT MET BY EITHER OF THESE PRODUCT SETS TO DO THEIR OWN M3 PROCESSING."

PURPOSE, OBJECTIVE, AND BACKGROUND OF WORK TO BE PERFORMED: THE FIRST OBJECTIVE IS TO MODEL AND DEVELOP AN OPTIMIZED SYSTEM OF HYBRID ACTIVE-PASSIVE RADIATION SHIELDING. THE SECOND OBJECTIVE IS TO USE A GENETIC ALGORITHMS (GAS) TOOLKIT COUPLED WITH WELL-DEVELOPED RADIATION TRANSPORT CODES IN A PROCESS THAT MIMICS EVOLUTION AND NATURAL SELECTION TO OBTAIN OPTIMUM SHIELDING CONFIGURATIONS. 3. DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK TO BE PERFORMED: THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PERFORM THE FOLLOWING BASIC, INNOVATIVE RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS: 3.1 TASK 1: THE FIRST TASK IS TO MODEL AND DEVELOP AN OPTIMIZED SYSTEM OF HYBRID ACTIVE-PASSIVE RADIATION SHIELDING. CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO CLEAR-CUT SOLUTION TO SHIELDING HUMANS FROM GCR (GALACTIC COSMIC RADIATION) DURING LONG DURATION SPACE TRAVEL (MORE THAN 6 MONTHS FROM EARTH TO MARS, ONE WAY) AND DURING PLANETARY STAYS FOR EXPLORATION. TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES EXIST: (1) CHOOSE THE RIGHT PASSIVE MATERIALS COMBINATIONS TO SLOW DOWN THE GCR AND THE SECONDARIES ARISING OUT OF THE INTERACTIONS OF THE GCR WITH INTERVENING MATTER; OR (2) USE ACTIVE MAGNETIC FIELDS TO DEFLECT THE GCR. THESE TWO APPROACHES HAVE LIMITATIONS, NECESSITATING A NEW APPROACH LIKE THE PROPOSED HYBRID SHIELDING. IN THE NEW HYBRID SHIELD APPROACH, THE GCR IS BENT BY THE MAGNETIC FIELD, AND INSTEAD OF TRAVELING IN A STRAIGHT PATH IT BENDS AND TAKES A LONGER PATH, THUS REQUIRING REDUCED MASS OF THE PASSIVE SHIELD COMPONENT. THE PASSIVE SHIELDING REDUCES THE SPEED OF THE INCOMING PARTICLES AND THEREBY REDUCES THE REQUIRED MAGNETIC FIELD INTENSITY AND THEREFORE REDUCES THE POWER REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACTIVE SHIELD COMPONENT. THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF INCREASED PATH LENGTH AND REDUCED PARTICLE SPEED ARE TWO CRITICAL CONTROLLING FACTORS FOR REALIZING IMPROVED SHIELDING EFFECTIVENESS. THE CONTRACTOR SHALL USE THEIR UNIFIED PROCESS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS (DEVELOPED UNDER SBIR PHASE II CONTRACT NAS1-99028) AND THEIR AS&M-DEVELOPED BASIC SHIELD SIMULATION PROGRAM BUILT ON AN UNDERLYING LAYER OF THE GEANT (GEOMETRY AND TRACKING) 4 PHYSICS CODE IN A 3-D RADIAL GRAPHICAL SIMULATION. THE CONTRACTOR SHALL MODEL THE RADIATION DOSE EQUIVALENT TO HUMAN PHANTOMS. THE CONTRACTOR SHALL USE A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH, WITH THE BEST AND VALIDATED SIMULATION TOOLS TO DEVELOP AND DOWN-SELECT VIABLE CONCEPTS, IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE RISKS. THE EFFORT AIMS TO DEVELOP A SERIES OF SIMULATIONS PROVIDING FOR ANALYSES OF SHIELDING SYSTEMS IN SUFFICIENTLY REALISTIC DETAIL TO ENABLE COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE BENEFITS PROVIDED AND THE RELATIVE MERITS OF VARIOUS OPTIMIZATIONS. GIVEN THAT THE PROPOSED SIMULATION ENGINE USES A MONTE CARLO APPROACH, IT IS GENERALLY BEST INITIALLY TO GO WITH THE SIMPLEST CONFIGURATION THAT MEETS REQUIREMENTS SO THAT STABLE STATISTICAL RESULTS CAN BE ACHIEVED MORE EASILY AND WITH LESS COMPUTATIONAL TIME. IN LATER STEPS OF THE OPTIMIZATION, IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO INVEST THE REQUIRED TIME TO ENSURE THAT THE PHYSICAL PROCESSES ARE ACCURATELY IMPLEMENTED, SO THAT ALL THE IMPORTANT FEATURES ARE CORRECTLY MODELED IN ORDER TO GET ACCURATE AND MEANINGFUL SIMULATIONS. THE POTENTIAL PAYOFF IS HIGH BECAUSE THE RESULTING HYBRID ACTIVE-PASSIVE SHIELD CONCEPT COULD ENABLE LONG DURATION SPACE TRAVEL AND SPACE EXPLORATION FOR HUMANS. THE DELIVERABLES FOR THIS TASK ARE COLOR POWERPOINT PRESENTATION SLIDES DESCRIBING THE APPROACHES TAKEN AND THE RESULTS OBTAINED. THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PREPARE TWO SETS OF POWERPOINT SLIDES, ONE SET SHORTLY AFTER COMMENCEMENT OF THE WORK AND THE SECOND SET TOWARD THE COMPLETION OF THE WORK. 3.2 TASK 2: THE SECOND TASK IS TO USE A GENETIC ALGORITHMS (GAS) TOOLKIT COUPLED WITH WELL-DEVELOPED RADIATION TRANSPORT CODES IN A PROCESS THAT MIMICS EVOLUTION AND NATURAL SELECTION TO OBTAIN AND DELIVER TO NASA THE OPTIMUM SHIELDING CONFIGURATIONS. SPECIFICALLY, THE TOOLKIT WILL ENABLE, IN AN AUTOMATED FASHION:  CREATING COMBIN"""

TASK TITLE: DETERMINATION OF ACOUSTIC BACKGROUND NOISE LEVEL AND SENSITIVITY OF 16 INFRASONIC MICROPHONES  1.0 	INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND:   SOUND AT FREQUENCIES BELOW 20 HZ IS CALLED INFRASOUND.  ACOUSTICAL STUDIES OF ATMOSPHERIC EVENTS LIKE CONVECTIVE STORMS, SHEAR-INDUCED TURBULENCE, ACOUSTIC GRAVITY WAVES, MICROBURSTS, HURRICANES, AND CLEAR AIR TURBULENCE (CAT) OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT THESE EVENTS ARE STRONG EMITTERS OF INFRASOUND.  A PARTICULARLY FAVORABLE PROPERTY OF INFRASOUND IS ITS PROPAGATION OVER LONG DISTANCES WITH LITTLE ATTENUATION.   OVER THE YEARS, NASA LANGLEY HAS DEVELOPED RELIABLE PORTABLE INFRASONIC DETECTION SYSTEMS TO DETECT INFRASONIC SIGNALS FROM LOCATIONS WHICH WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY POSSIBLE BY ANY OTHER MEANS.  THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF THIS SYSTEM ARE;  1.	HIGHLY SENSITIVE INFRASONIC MICROPHONES. 2.	COMPACT INFRASONIC WINDSCREENS. 3.	CROSS-CORRELATION ALGORITHM. 4.	INFRASONIC CALIBRATORS.  RECENTLY, SEVERAL OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES, INCLUDING DOD, HAVE SHOWN STRONG INTEREST IN USING PORTABLE INFRASONIC DETECTION SYSTEM TO DETECT EVENTS WHICH CAN PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION FOR NATIONAL SECURITY.

SLM ENABLES US TO \PRINT\"" THE SPOOL PIECE IN DAYS, DESPITE THE COMPLEXITY OF THE REGENERATIVE LINER''S INHERENT FLOW PASSAGE COMPLEXITY. THIS REDUCTION IN MANUFACTURING LEAD TIME, COMBINED WITH THE FACT THAT SLM MANUFACTURING COSTS ARE DRIVEN IN LARGE PART BY THE AMOUNT OF RAW POWDER USED DURING FABRICATION, RESULTS IN A SUBSTANTIAL COST REDUCTION FOR FUTURE REGENERATIVELYCOOLED ROCKET ENGINES. ADDITIONALLY, THE PROPOSED ADVANCED REGENERATIVE COOLING APPROACH FEATURES A HEAT-PICKUP EFFICIENCY THAT IS AT LEAST TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER THAN TRADITIONAL MILLED CHANNEL LINERS AND/OR BRAZED TUBE BUNDLE CHAMBERS. AS A RESULT OF OUR PHASE I ACTIVITY AND CONFIDENCE IN OUR COMMERCIALIZATION PATH, WE WILL BE MAKING A CAPITAL INVESTMENT TO STAND UP AN SLM MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY IN HOUSE. WE PLAN TO AUGMENT THAT INVESTMENT WITH AN INTERNALLY-FUNDED TRADE STUDY THAT WE WILL USE TO DERIVE MAIN COMBUSTION CHAMBER PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR A FUTURE EXPANDER CYCLE ENGINE.

CROPGLASS IS A VERY LOW RISK TECHNOLOGY, AS IT IS MADE FROM ENTIRELY FLIGHT HERITAGE MATERIALS, IT IS LOW PROFILE AND IT HAS NO MOVING PARTS. ADDITIONALLY, CROPGLASS LEVERAGES MATURE NANO- AND MICROFABRICATION TECHNIQUES WHICH WILL RESULT IN A LOW COST FOR HIGH VOLUMES. CROPGLASS OFFERS THE ABILITY TO INCREASE POWER OR DECREASE COST WITHOUT INFLUENCING OTHER SOLAR ARRAY DESIGN PARAMETERS. VERY LARGE SOLAR ARRAYS WILL BENEFIT MOST BECAUSE OF THE HUGE POWER LEVELS AND COST OF THESE PROGRAMS. BECAUSE CROPGLASS CAN BE ADDED TO A COMPLETE ARRAY, THIS INNOVATION WILL ALSO BE BENEFICIAL TO COMPLETED SOLAR ARRAY PROGRAMS THAT EXPERIENCED LESS THAN ANTICIPATED POWER OR INCREASES IN NEEDED POWER LATE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF THE SOLAR ARRAYS. COMPETING APPROACHES INCLUDE REFLECTIVE CONCENTRATORS SUCH AS PANEL EDGE REFLECTORS. WHAT MAKES CROP GLASS UNIQUE IS THAT IT IS FLAT, REQUIRES NO DEPLOYMENT OF OPTICS AND DOES NOT REQUIRE A CUSTOM SOLAR PANEL OR BLANKET DESIGN. NO EXISTING CONCENTRATION TECHNOLOGY OFFERS SUCH A LOW COST, LOW RISK AND FLIGHT HERITAGE-BASED PATH TO HIGHER POWER AND LOWER COST. CROPGLASS CONCENTRATES LIGHT AT LESS THAN 3X. PAST INDUSTRY ATTEMPTS AT CONCENTRATION ABOVE 10X HAVE SHOWN MANY ENGINEERING CHALLENGES AT THESE HIGH CONCENTRATION LEVELS.

THE SSLAPSS USES PLANAR ARRAYS OF 6 DIFFERENT WAVELENGTH LEDS LOCATED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE STRING UNDER TEST IN THE SOLAR ARRAY. THE INDIVIDUAL LED INTENSITY CONTROL GIVES GREAT FLEXIBILITY TO MEET POWER AND SPATIAL UNIFORMITY REQUIREMENTS. THE LED SOURCES ARE SELECTED TO EACH ILLUMINATE ONE JUNCTION IN A 6-JUNCTION CELL. THE SAME LEDS WILL ALSO BE USED FOR 3- AND 4-JUNCTION CELLS. THIS MEANS THAT ONE SSLAPSS CAN MEASURE THE CURRENT (3- JUNCTION) AND FUTURE (4- AND 6-JUNCTION) CELLS. THIS TECHNOLOGY IS ALSO HIGHLY FLEXIBLE SO THAT CELLS WITH AN EVEN GREATER NUMBER OF JUNCTIONS OR CELLS WITH DIFFERENT SPECTRAL DIVISIONS COULD BE MEASURE BY PRODUCING A SSLAPSS WITH A GREATER NUMBER OF LEDS OR A DIFFERENT SPECTRAL MIX OF LEDS IN THE ILLUMINATION ARRAY. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING 3-, 4- AND 6-JUNCTION CELL CAPABILITY AT LOWER SYSTEMS COSTS THAN THE SOP LAPSS, THE SSLAPSS ALSO HAS MANY OTHER BENEFITS: IT REQUIRES MINIMAL CLEAN ROOM FLOOR SPACE, IT CAN PROVIDE LOW LIGHT LEVELS (LILT), IT CAN MEASURE ARRAYS IN HORITOZONTAL ORIENTATIONS, IT CAN SCALE TO ANY BUS VOLTAGE OR STRING LENGTH, IT USES PROVEN STANDARDS AND TEST METHODS AND IT PROVIDES FOR EASIER CALIBRATION THAN THE SOP LAPSS. FOUR- AND 6- JUNCTION LAPSS TECHNOLOGY IS NECESSARY TO EVALUATE, TEST AND FLY ADVANCED SOLAR CELL TECHNOLOGIES. THE SSLAPSS EXTENDS AN ESSENTIAL, PROVEN MEASUREMENT METHOD TO THE FUTURE OF SPACE POWER CONVERSION TECHNOLOGIES"

THE SPARS ARE THE STRUCTURAL MEMBERS THAT SUPPORT THE MEGAFLEX SOLAR ARRAY DEPLOYED BLANKET. WHEN THE SOLAR ARRAY EXPERIENCES A DEPLOYED LOAD, THE STRUCTURAL LOAD PATH STARTS IN THE SPARS WHICH CARRY THE LOAD TO THE HUB ASSEMBLY THAT THEN PASS IT ON TO THE LATCHED PANEL ASSEMBLIES THAT ACT AS THE STRUCTURAL BACK-BONE OF THE DEPLOYED ARRAY AND CARRY THE LOAD TO THE SOLAR ARRAY TO SPACECRAFT INTERFACE. THEREFORE AS THE MEGAFLEX BLANKET AREAS INCREASE THE SPAR LOADING INCREASES WHICH CAUSES HIGHER STRESS LEVELS IN THE SPARS, UNLESS THEY ARE APPROPRIATELY SCALED IN SIZE. HOWEVER DIRECTLY SCALING THE SPARS IN SIZE FROM THEIR CURRENT DESIGN STATE IS NOT THE MOST OPTIMIZED DESIGN FOR STRENGTH AND MASS. THIS IS WHY AD PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A HIERARCHICAL SET OF MEGAFLEX SPAR DESIGNS WITH ATK. SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE OF THIS PROPOSED STRATEGIC PLAN HAS FAR REACHING BENEFITS WHICH START WITH THE SCALING RISK REDUCTION OF LARGER FUTURE MEGAFLEX SOLAR ARRAYS TO SUPPORT POWER DEMANDS BEYOND 50KW WITH HIGH DEPLOYED LOADING REQUIREMENTS. THE BENEFITS CONTINUE WITH MASS SAVINGS FOR THESE ARRAYS OBTAINED BY THE MASS OPTIMIZED FUTURE SPARS WHICH WILL ENABLE MORE PAYLOAD FOR FUTURE HEOMD OR OTHER MISSIONS AND OR LAUNCH COST SAVINGS. FINALLY, DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR FUTURE FLIGHT QUALIFICATION OF A MEGAFLEX SOLAR ARRAY>50KW IN SIZE WITH HIGH DEPLOYED LOADING REQUIREMENTS WILL BE SAVED BECAUSE THIS WORK WILL ALREADY HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. ALL OF THESE BENEFITS SUPPORT FUTURE HEOMD MISSIONS AND OTHERS, WHICH THEREFORE FURTHER VALIDATES THE MERIT OF THE PROPOSED INNOVATION AND WORK TO BE COMPLETED ON THIS SBIR."

OUR GOAL WILL BE TO EVALUATE SENSOR AND PLATFORM TRADEOFFS SYSTEMATICALLY AGAINST IN SITU INVESTMENTS, AS WELL AS PROVIDE DETAILED TRACKING AND CHARACTERIZATION OF UNCERTAINTY IN A COST-BENEFIT FRAMEWORK. KALIMANTAN IS AN IDEAL AREA TO EVALUATE THE USE OF REMOTE SENSING METHODS BECAUSE MEASURING FORESTCARBON STOCKS AND THEIR HUMAN CAUSED CHANGES WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF CERTAINTY IN AREAS OF DENSE TROPICAL FORESTS HAS PROVEN TO BE DIFFICULT. WHILE THE PROPOSED NFMS COMPONENTS WILL BE DEVELOPED AT THE SUBNATIONAL SCALE FOR KALIMANTAN, WE WILL TARGET THESE METHODS FOR APPLICABILITY ACROSS BROADER GEOGRAPHIES AND FOR IMPLEMENTATION AT VARIOUS SCALES. THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL ADVANCE THE STATE OF THE ART OF MEASURING, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION (MRV) SYSTEM METHODOLOGIES IN WAYS THAT ARE BOTH TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL. FIRST, BECAUSE A PRIMARY FOCUS OF CARBON MONITORING SYSTEMS, ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, IS ON COST-EFFECTIVENESS, OUR ANALYSIS OF OPTIMAL INPUTS OF INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS SATELLITE, AIRBORNE, AND IN SITU MEASUREMENTS WILL PROVIDE VALUABLE PRACTICAL INFORMATION THAT COUNTRIES CAN USE TO CONSIDER THE TRADEOFFS. SECOND, BECAUSE QUANTIFYING AND UNDERSTANDING UNCERTAINTY IS CRITICAL BOTH IN AN EARTH SCIENCE RESEARCH CONTEXT AND WITH REGARD TO PAYMENT FOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, OUR DEVELOPMENT OF REUSABLE METHODS FOR TRACKING AND EVALUATING UNCERTAINTY WITHIN A CARBON MONITORING SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR STAKEHOLDERS AND RESEARCHERS TO UNDERSTAND AND MINIMIZE ERRORS ACROSS MRV COMPONENTS. THIRD, BECAUSE CARBON MONITORING REQUIRES INTEGRATION OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES WITH MULTIDISCIPLINARY SCIENTIFIC METHODS FROM FORESTRY,ECOLOGY, SOIL SCIENCE, REMOTE SENSING AND BIOGEOCHEMISTRY, OUR TEAM''S EXPERTISE IS PARTICULARLY WELL-CONSTRUCTED TO ADDRESS THESE COMPLEX SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL ISSUES."

SINCE TESTING AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES RESULTS IN HIGHER BURN RATES FOR TYPICAL PROPELLANTS, AND THUS HIGHER WORKING PRESSURES, AMBIENT TESTS RESULT IN A MOTOR CASE THAT IS HEAVIER THAN REQUIRED FOR A LOW TEMPERATURE MISSION, BECAUSE AMBIENT TESTING RESULTS IN A HIGHER MAXIMUM EXPECTED OPERATING PRESSURE. OUR PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY ALLEVIATES THAT PROBLEM BY USING A PLATEAU-BURNING COMPOSITE PROPELLANT THAT WILL SUBSTANTIALLY LESSEN THE BURN RATE SENSITIVITY TO TEMPERATURE. AS SUCH, THE MAV OPERATING PRESSURE IN AMBIENT CONDITIONS WILL MORE CLOSELY RESEMBLE THOSE ON THE MARS SURFACE, ALLOWING FOR A LIGHTER MOTOR CASE RESULTING IN REDUCED WEIGHT, SMALLER VOLUME AND GREATER PROPELLANT MASS FRACTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, OUR PLATEAU BURNING FORMULATION WILL INCLUDE A LOW TEMPERATURE BINDER WITH A HIGH DENSITY FUEL ADDITIVE, IN ORDER TO ALLEVIATE THE LOADING STRESSES AT LOW TEMPERATURES AND FURTHER INCREASE THE MOTOR DENSITY-ISP.

The studies of meteorites show that solar system planetesimals formed at the orbital distances of today's asteroids experienced an aqueous phase of alteration, where organic material condensed from the nebula was further modified by chemical reactions. Understanding the extent of these processes may offer insights into how abiotic organic compounds, sometimes identical to biomolecules, formed and/or survived in planetary environments. This proposal is the outgrowth of work conducted in our laboratory that characterized L-enantiomeric excesses (ee) within a subgroup of meteoritic amino acids, which provide the only case of molecular asymmetry measured outside the Biosphere. To date, these ee seem limited to the chiral 2-methyl-2-amino acids, however, it is possible that they were also present in 2-H-2-amino acids but were lost to racemization during aqueous reactions. Because racemization, the reversal and equilibration between L- and D-configurations in water, affects especially amino acids having a hydrogen attached to the second carbon, the possibility would seem hard to prove. However, acids having two chiral centers instead of one may still be able to reveal prior ee for 2-H compounds in meteorites, in spite of water exposure and racemization. Their study, would offer unique opportunities to estimate the extent of molecular asymmetry in the solar nebula upon formation of meteorite parent bodies and the physico-chemical conditions of those planetesimal aqueous processes. We propose to perform chiral analyses of Murchison and Murray diasteromeric amino and monocarboxylic acids, which are known but were never analyzed for this purpose, employing methodologies we have used previously with success. The proposed studies seek an understanding of chemical processes in the early solar system that fostered the evolution of abiotic organic molecules and of the traits they share with biomolecules. As such, they are directly relevant to the objectives of this NRA."

In particular, robotic follow-up can be performed during, and between, human missions in order to increase crew productivity and reduce operational risk. The human return to the Moon in 2020 offers new opportunities to significantly advance the scientific exploration of the Moon. When the new lunar surface campaign begins, humans will initially be on the Moon less than 10% of the time. During the 90% of time between crew visits, however, robots will be available to perform surface operations. A central challenge, therefore, is to understand how robotic systems can be used to effectively address surface science needs. We propose to examine how humans and robots can work together in a coordinated manner to improve operational efficacy and science return. In this study, the central question that we will address is: How can robotic rovers best support human exploration with follow-up activity? Our goals are to: 1) Identify surface science scenarios for human explorers to draw maximum benefit from robotic follow-up to vehicular traverses and on-foot EVAs. 2) Identify science operations requirements for conducting ""robotic follow-up"" on planetary surfaces after human exploration. 3) Identify mission operations protocols for optimizing human exploration and robotic follow-up.

The proposed investigation also includes funding for a graduate student to help train the next generation of planetary scientists, as encouraged by the Dawn Science Team. More specifically, the proposed science investigation would include: (Task 1) Identify, characterize, and map any and all volcanic and plutonic features on the surface of Vesta, determine their contact (stratigraphic) relationships with each other and surrounding materials, determine the diversity of the deposits and their source vents (if possible), map their areal extents, and determine their relative ages using superposition relationships and crater counts. Working with Dawn Co-Is we would also identify candidate volcanic features for determining their absolute (cratering model) ages using well-established crater statistical methods. We expect to identify geologic features such as (e.g., impact craters, dikes, sills, lava flows, calderas, lava lakes, shields, domes, cones, layering in the walls of craters exposing lava flows and intrusions, contact boundaries between flow units, potential pyroclastic deposits). However, in the unlikely event that no volcanic or plutonic materials are found on Vesta, we will use the methods discussed above to identify, characterize, and map all other geologic features produced by other processes; (Task 2) Test the predictions of Wilson and Keil (1996, 1997) on the types and dimensions of predicted igneous deposits on Vesta. This would be done by comparing any identified Igneous features to their predictions for lava flow dimensions and the depths of intrusions, as well as by searching for any evidence of explosive pyroclastic deposits (they predict none should occur on Vesta). Additionally, if warranted, we can revisit the mathematical models of Wilson and Keil (1996,1997) with ''in situ'' measurements from FC images (i.e., actual flow dimensions, extents of any pyroclastic material), to investigate any similarities or differences in Vesta's volcanic deposits with their previous model predictions, which will inform about the volumes and rheologies of Vesta's magma compositions and volatile inventory. We would accomplish these objectives through analysis of Framing Camera Images, including use of stereo images (where available) and shadow measurements for depth. We would make geologic maps of interesting and complex areas as tools to further aid the image analysis. Any maps produced would be published in peer-reviewed journals as part of our anticipated papers that would discuss our results and new insights into geologic processes and features found on Vesta. This work would enhance our understanding of the geologic history of this differentiated asteroid, and of the nature and diversity of planetary volcanism in the Solar System, particularly how volcanism operated on a small body. Consequently, this research is directly relevant to NASA's goals for understanding the genesis and evolution of Solar System bodies, and the Dawn science objectives of understanding the origin and evolution of this unique asteroid."

N-containing ammonia, amino acids and amines are preponderant and compounds such as aldehydes and ketones are abundant as well as. The study of CR2 diastereomer amino acids also allowed the inference of an original asymmetry in their precursor aldehydes. In light of the uniqueness and clear prebiotic implications of these findings, studies are proposed towards gaining a fuller understanding of CR2 chiral and molecular composition as well as assessing prebiotically realistic pathways of early Earth evolution for selected amino acids of meteoritic distribution. Extend the search for possible enantiomeric excesses to CR2 hydroxy- and monocarboxylic acids that, like amino acids, might have formed from aldehyde precursors. Search CR2 extracts for N-containing compounds of prebiotic significance (HCN, formamide, urea, peptides) that have not yet been identified but could be abundant in these meteorites. Assess the possible formation of small peptides from standard amino acid pools of CR2 and CR2/CM2 mixed composition under prebiotic settings. Continue the study of the chiral interactions between sugars and amino acids in a water-based prebiotic model. Methodologies developed through the years in our laboratory will allow a ready chiral investigation of hydoxy-, monocarboxylic acids. Methodologies for the analyses of other compounds and model experiments will be developed, following literature and preliminary experimental findings. These studies will broaden our understanding of cosmochemical samples with unique prebiotic potential, address anew the basic exobiological question of whether extraterrestrial organic compounds contributed to terrestrial molecular evolution and will provide relevant data on how this evolution might have proceeded upon delivery to the early Earth of organic materials with CR or CR/CM mixed-compositions."

The quantification of history"" requires precise and accurate dating of impact events. Noble gas geochronology of melted or shocked target rocks is historically one of the most successful approaches to dating impacts, but the most advanced techniques developed since the Apollo era for terrestrial Ar and He geochronology are not commonly applied to extraterrestrial samples. For example, state-of-the-art 40Ar/39Ar geochronology of frictional melts associated with major fault zones (pseudotachylites) typically employs the extremely high spatial resolution of ultraviolet (UV) laser microprobes to selectively ablate and analyze glassy or recrystallized domains in polished petrographic thin sections while avoiding contamination by older xenolithic or xenocrystic materials. Since many of the scientific challenges involved in geochronologic studies of impact melts are identical to those involved in geochronologic studies of impact melts, we propose to evaluate the utility of 40Ar/39Ar UV laser microprobe dating of lunar impact melts through two studies. The first involves using this technique to date materials from the Mistastin Lake Impact Crater, northern Labrador. Target rocks of the ca. 36 Ma Mistastin Lake impact are intermediate to mafic igneous rocks (primarily anorthosites, hypersthene monzonites, and granodiorites), such that studies in and around this crater provide a unique opportunity to study impact melts and breccias that are among the best lithologic analogues on Earth for samples that may be encountered in future explorations of impact sites on the Moon (such as South Pole-Aitken). More importantly for our purposes, the Mistastin Lake impactites are simple by comparison to lunar impactites, which record a complex history of multiple impact events. In the more ambitious second study, we will move on to the more difficult problem of dating polyphase Apollo 17 impact breccias by 40Ar/39Ar UV laser microprobe, with an eye toward comparing the results to previous impact chronologies developed through conventional 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb ion microprobe work by other research teams and hopefully expanding our knowledge of the impact record in the Taurus-Littrow valley. In this way, we will determine whether or not the higher spatial resolution of UV laser microprobe studies add extra value to impact chronology studies beyond that provided by more conventional techniques. Finally, our last study represents the first reconnaissance application of the (U-Th)/He UV laser microprobe in impact chronology studies. Recently, applications of conventional (U-Th)/He zircon and apatite dating techniques have provided important constraints on the ages of some major terrestrial impact structures, but similar studies on lunar samples will likely necessitate the use of more advanced, laser ablation techniques that permit analyses of very small sa"
