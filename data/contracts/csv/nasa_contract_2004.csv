The main purpose of this program is to produce and deliver to NASA three Tracking and Data Relay Satellites designated as TDRS H, I and J. These satellites will be used to continue the present function of the existing TDRS Spacecraft. The TDRS H, I and J shall be fully compatible with, and be capable of functioning as a part of, the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) as implemented and operated by the White Sands Complex (WSC) which includes the Second TDRS Ground Terminal (STGT) and the White Sands Ground Terminal Upgrade (WSGTU). The TDRS H, I, and J Program shall encompass all of the efforts required to design, develop, build, test, ship, and support the launch and on-orbit activation of three Tracking and Data Relay Satellites. These satellites shall be delivered to NASA at the Eastern Test Range. The contractor shall be responsible for providing necessary efforts required for the pre-launch and launch operations with the expendable launch vehicle provided by the Government. Upon successful injection into a geosynchronous orbit, the contractor shall perform a checkout and activation of the spacecraft and shall support the integration of the spacecraft into the operational Space Network. The contractor is required to deliver three satellites that are fully compatible and operational with the remainder of the TDRSS and all TDRSS users. Changes to the existing space-to-space link between the TDRS and the users, and changes to other existing operational interfaces between user spacecraft and existing user services are not permitted. The WSC, in its STGT and WSGTU implementation, will operate the TDRS H, I and J to provide the specified user services. The contractor's delivered satellites and other efforts must meet all specifications of TDRS-RP-SY-001. The operations of the TDRS H, I, and J system and spacecraft shall, quantitatively and qualitatively, perform as well as or better than the existing TDRS and the existing WSC flight operations. In the event that the contractor's satellite design or implementation is not fully compatible and operational with the baseline WSC and TDRSS as provided by NASA, the contractor is responsible for designing, implementing, documenting and validating changes to the WSC, to assure the required compatibility and operability. The Ka-Band Option service shall have all of the attributes of the existing Ku-Band service except for the full time simulation and verification capability known in the STGT implementation as the end-to-end test system. The baseline configuration of the WSC includes six Space Ground Link Terminals (SGLT's). Four SGLT's shall be changed to accommodate the TDRS H, I, and J design. The changes made by the contractor to the WSC must not adversely affect the operations of the WSC with the F-l through F-7 spacecraft. Additionally, the effort of implementing these changes by the contractor shall not cause any adverse impacts to on-going operations except for the temporary removal of a single SGLT at a time. The contractor shall also design, develop, implement, test and deliver the TDRS H, I, and J Spacecraft Emulator (TSE) and the Real-Time Telemetry Monitoring System (RTMS)."

THIS PROGRAM ADDRESSES THE REQUEST FOR RPS CONVERSION TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT IN NRA-02-OSS-01.  THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT IS TO DEMONSTRATE A STATIC TPV POWER CONVERTER SUITABLE FOR USE WITH AN ADVANCED RPS USING GPHS HEAT SOURCES, BRINGING THIS CONVERTER TECHNOLOGY (RTPV) TO TRL 5 AT THE END OF THE THIRD YEAR.  TPV CONVERTS RADIANT ENERGY FROM A HOT EMITTER TO ELECTRICAL POWER USING PV CELLS.  TPV USES ADVANCED PV CELLS TO UTILIZE A BROADER, SPECTRALLY-TUNED RANGE OF WAVELENGTHS FOR MORE EFFICIENT POWER CONVERSION THAN SOLAR PV CELLS.  SPECTRAL CONTROL, INCLUDING SELECTIVE EMITTER, PV CELL, AND FILTER CHARACTERISTICS, IS KEY TO HIGH PERFORMANCE.  LIFETIME TESTS ARE PLANNED.  STEPS IN THE DEVELOPMENT INCLUDE: YEAR 1:  DEVELOP THE TPV MODULE (TRL 3) - DEVELOP, FABRICATE, DEMONSTRATE AND SELECT THE BEST OPTIONS FROM VARIOUS EMITTERS, PV CELLS, AND FILTER APPROACHES, WITH SUPPORT EFFORTS TO DEVELOP THE PRELIMINARY CONVERTER DESIGN AND TO ADDRESS TWO KEY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT CONVERTER LIFETIME:  RADIATION EFFECTS ON THE PV CELLS AND MATERIALS TRANSFER.  YEAR 2:  DEMONSTRATE A PROTOTYPIC RTPV OPTICAL CAVITY/CONVERTER (TRL 4) - FABRICATE AND TEST AN ELECTRICALLY HEATED BASELINE CONVERTER WITH PROTOTYPICAL DESIGN (OPTICAL CAVITY/CONVERTER AND IMMEDIATE STRUCTURE), WITH SUPPORTING MODELING AND TESTING EFFORTS, AS WELL AS CONTINUE RADIATION EXPOSURE AND MATERIALS LIFE TESTS.  YEAR 3:  DEMONSTRATE A BREADBOARD RTPV OPTICAL CAVITY/CONVERTER AND LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE OF A PROTOTYPIC CONVERTER (TRL 5) - BUILD A BREADBOARD MODEL WITH THE OPTIMUM CONVERTER DESIGN AND A POWER CONVERTER MODULE, THEN TEST IN A THERMAL VACUUM CHAMBER; CONCLUDE SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO DEMONSTRATE LONG LIFE WITH MINIMAL POWER DECREASE.  RECENT ADVANCES IN INGAAS PV CELL, FILTER, AND SLECTIVE EMITTER TECHNOLOGY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THE PERFORMANCE OF TPV SYSTEMS TO THE POINT THAT TPV SYSTEMS ARE NOW COMPETITIVE IN CONVERSION EFFICIENCY A ND SPECIFIC POWER WITH DYNAMIC POWER SYSTEMS.  SPECIFICALLY, TPV CONVERTER EFFIFIENCY OF 20% HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED AT 1330 K FOR SINGLE CELLS (SIERGIEJ ET AL. 2002) AND FOR A 16-CELL ARRAY IN AN OPTICAL CAVITY DURING THE YEAR 1 EFFORT.  WE EXPECT TO IMPROVE ON THIS."

A system for autonomous detection and exploitation of weather phenomena for endurance or range enhancement for loitering unmanned air vehicles. The system is to consist of hardware and software for coarse identification of geographical areas where advantageous weather phenomena (such as soaring conditions) are present. Custom autopilot and sensors will enable the fine detection of the phenomena and cause the UAV to adopt an optimal flight path that exploits the phenomena. The system will consist of custom hardware, software, and sensors. A simulation of the system was demonstrated in Phase I, which is to be rendered in hardware in Phase II, including complete full flight test of the system on a 40 pound class UAV. The anticipated result being high endurance schemes for loitering UAVs, innovative flight control systems for UAVs, optimal flight path determination and execution. These developments dovetail with current NASA efforts to develop more intelligent and autonomous air vehicles for use in science mission, military and homeland security missions. The concepts and systems can be ported to small manned aircraft as well. The system as proposed can be used to increase the endurance or range, and/or reduce the fuel consumption of loitering air vehicles operating at low to medium altitudes. There are no UAVs currently having thermal soaring capability. By endowing UAVs with soaring capability, endurance can be enhanced and a framework will exist for next generation UAVs that can sense beneficial atmospheric conditions, couple it with data from online sources, and adapt to exploit the prevailing conditions optimally to achieve increased endurance range. These methods can be adopted for extending the endurance of small aircraft in emergency situations as well. The autopilot could be used by sport glider and motorglider pilots.
