THIS HAS OPENED THE DOOR FOR BIG DATA PROCESSING USING SPACEBORNE OPTICAL IMAGERY TO CHARACTERIZE LAND SURFACE PHENOMENA IN HIGH-END COMPUTING (HEC; ACRONYMS LIST ON PAGE 21) ENVIRONMENTS. RECENT EXAMPLES INCLUDE GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE, AMAZON WEB SERVICES CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES, NASA EARTH EXCHANGE AND NASA CENTER FOR CLIMATE SIMULATION (NCCS) ADVANCED DATA ANALYTICS PLATFORM (ADAPT). AT THE SAME TIME, A GROWING CONSTELLATION OF COMMERCIAL VERY-HIGH-RESOLUTION (VHR) SATELLITES OFFER GLOBAL 1-2-DAY REPEAT COVERAGE THAT CAN COMPLEMENT NASA EARTH OBSERVING (EO) MISSIONS WITH STEREO AND SUPER-SPECTRAL CAPABILITIES.

THE DG ARCHIVE INCLUDES DATA FROM 7 SATELLITES INCLUDING WORLDVIEW-1, 2, 3, 4, QUICKBIRD-2, GEOEYE-1 AND IKONOS-2. PRIOR TO 2008, A LIMITED NUMBER OF EO VHR IMAGES WERE OFTEN USED INDIVIDUALLY FOR EVALUATION AND VALIDATION OVER SMALL AREAS, TO COMPARE TO COARSER RESOLUTION NASA EO DATA BECAUSE THESE DATA WERE SNAPSHOTS IN SPACE AND TIME. NOW, THE DG CONSTELLATION ENABLES REPEAT, CONTIGUOUS COVERAGE OVER LARGE REGIONS. THESE DATA ARE A VALUABLE EO RESOURCE FOR SCALING GLOBAL ECOLOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL PHENOMENA OCCURRING AT SUBMETER SCALES THAT CAN ENHANCE NASA EO SCIENCE THAT OCCURS AT MODERATE TO COARSE RESOLUTIONS. THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO PROVIDE TOOLS AS AN APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE (API) FOR MASS PROCESSING SPATIALLY CONTIGUOUS AND TEMPORALLY CONSISTENT ARCHIVED NASA-GSFC DG VHR DATA THAT CAN ONLY EFFICIENTLY BE PERFORMED ON NASA HEC RESOURCES DUE TO DG-NGA LICENSING LIMITATIONS AND COMPUTATIONAL REQUIREMENTS.",,,,

THE PROPOSED WORK WILL OCCUR IN THREE PHASES OVER FOUR YEARS. IN 2015, RESEARCH ACTIVITIES WILL FOCUS ON ANALYSIS OF MULTI-DECADAL REMOTE-SENSING DATA TIME-SERIES, AND RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES OF HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGERY. RESULTS OF THE REMOTE-SENSING ANALYSIS WILL BE USED TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A GROUND-BASED DATA COLLECTION EFFORT FOCUSED ON VEGETATION, SOILS, HYDROLOGY, AND PERMAFROST ACROSS ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS NEAR TWO YUPIK POPULATION CENTERS: THE CENTRAL COAST REGION NEAR CHEVAK AND THE YUKON DELTA NEAR EMMONAK. IN 2018, WORK WILL FOCUS ON APPLYING FINDINGS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS AND NEEDS FOR INFORMATION IDENTIFIED BY STAKEHOLDERS AND LAND MANAGERS. THE PROJECT WILL LEVERAGE DETAILED LONG-TERM FIELD DATASETS, AS WELL AS DATA PRODUCTS GENERATED FROM RECENTLY-COMPLETED VEGETATION MAPPING AND REMOTE-SENSING ANALYSIS EFFORTS IN WESTERN ALASKA.",,,,

CONVERSELY, SHARAD SIGNALS ARE UNABLE TO TRAVERSE THE #tilde#1 3.5 KM THICK SPLD, EVEN THOUGH IT IS ALSO COMPOSED PREDOMINANTLY OF WATER ICE. SOMETHING IS SCATTERING THE SHARAD ECHO, CREATING A FOG-LIKE APPEARANCE SUBSEQUENT TO THE SPLD SURFACE RETURN. TYPICALLY, SHARAD IMAGES 1.1 1.5 KM INTO THE SPLD, THOUGH EVEN IN THIN REGIONS OF THE SPLD (<1.5 KM THICK), THE SHARAD SIGNAL DOES NOT ALWAYS DETECT A BASAL REFLECTOR.

ALSO, THE REQUIRED ENERGY DEPOSITION RATE IS MUCH HIGHER IN ARS COMPARED TO CORONAL HOLES OR THE QUIET SUN. MANY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT AN ENERGY DEPOSITION MECHANISM MUST BE OPERATING IN THE SOLAR CORONA TO MAINTAIN THE TEMPERATURES OBSERVED. A LEADING THEORY IS THAT THE CORONA IS HEATED BY LARGE NUMBER OF SMALL ENERGY RELEASE EVENTS KNOWN AS NANOFLARES. A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE NUMBER OF NANOFLARES, WITH SUFFICIENTLY HIGH OCCURRENCE RATE, CAN PROVIDE ENOUGH ENERGY TO HEAT THE CORONA. INSTRUMENTATION LIMITATIONS MEAN THAT NANOFLARES ARE NOT OBSERVED DIRECTLY: THEREFORE, MUCH OF THE EVIDENCE FOR THEIR EXISTENCE IS INFERRED FROM OBSERVATIONS AND NUMERICAL MODELING. DETERMINING THE ENERGY DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE RATE OF NANOFLARES IN THE AR CORONA WOULD BE A HUGE STEP FORWARD IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HEATING IN CORONAL PLASMAS. VIALL&KLIMCHUK 2011, 2013, 2014, 2017 HAVE SHOWN THAT THE TIMING OF AR CORONAL EMISSION BRIGHTENINGS IN MULTIPLE CHANNELS OF SOLAR DYNAMICS OBSERVATORY ATMOSPHERIC IMAGING ASSEMBLY (SDO/AIA) FOLLOWS THAT EXPECTED FROM SIMULATIONS OF A NANOFLARE-HEATED CORONA. USING NUMERICAL HYDRODYNAMIC RADIATIVE EMISSION MODEL FOR THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE (HYDRAD)-BASED SIMULATIONS OF AIA EMISSION FOR AN AR, BRADSHAW&VIALL 2016 HAVE SHOWN THAT THE TIMING OF CORONAL EMISSION BRIGHTENINGS IS DEPENDENT ON THE PROPERTIES OF THE NANOFLARE ENERGY DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE RATE. RELATEDLY, IRELAND ET AL. 2015 SHOW THAT AVERAGE POWER SPECTRA P(F) (WHERE F IS FREQUENCY) OF TIME SERIES OF AIA 171  AND 193  AR IMAGES ARE DOMINATED BY POWER LAWS, P(F)#tilde#F^(-Z), Z>0. IRELAND ET AL. 2015 SHOW THAT A DISTRIBUTION OF EXPONENTIALLY DECAYING EVENTS OF EMISSION E ALONG THE LINE-OF-SIGHT (LOS), WHERE N(E)#tilde#E^(-M) AND THE SIZE OF THE EMISSION DEPENDS ON ITS DURATION T SUCH THAT E#tilde#T^K CREATES A POWER LAW POWER SPECTRUM P(F)#tilde#F^-K(2-M). CONSEQUENTLY, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT A DISTRIBUTION OF NANOFLARE EVENTS CAUSES BOTH THE EMISSION POWER-LAW POWER SPECTRUM IN AIA TIME-SERIES AS WELL AS THE OBSERVED BRIGHTENING TIME-LAGS. THEREFORE, WE WILL USE THE AIA EMISSION POWER-LAW POWER SPECTRA AND BRIGHTENING TIME-LAGS IN COMBINATION FOR THE FIRST TIME AS CONSTRAINTS ON THE ENERGY DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE RATE OF NANOFLARES. METHODOLOGY: WE WILL STUDY THE FOURIER POWER SPECTRA OF THE EMISSION GENERATED BY SIMULATED NANOFLARE ENERGY DEPOSITION EVENTS, AND COMPARE THAT TO THE OBSERVED FOURIER POWER SPECTRA FOR THE ARS STUDIED BY VIALL&KLIMCHUK 2012, 2017 AND WARREN ET AL. 2012. WE WILL USE THE ENTHALPY BASED THERMAL EVOLUTION OF LOOPS (EBTEL) AND HYDRAD NUMERICAL MODELS APPLIED TO AR MAGNETIC SKELETONS TO CALCULATE THE EMISSION ALONG THE LOS. THE TOTAL EMISSION MEASURE WILL THEN BE FOLDED THROUGH THE INSTRUMENT RESPONSE OF AIA. BY COMPARING THE OBSERVED AND SIMULATED AIA POWER SPECTRA IN ALL CHANNELS, AND SIMULTANEOUSLY REQUIRING THAT THE OBSERVED AND SIMULATED AIA EMISSION HAVE THE SAME CROSS-AIA CHANNEL TIME-LAG PROPERTIES, WE WILL DISCOVER IMPORTANT NEW CONSTRAINTS ON THE POSSIBLE DISTRIBUTIONS AND FREQUENCY RATES OF NANOFLARES THAT REPRODUCE THE OBSERVED EMISSION. THIS WILL HELP ANSWER A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IN SOLAR PHYSICS - WHY IS THE CORONA HOT? RELEVANCE TO THE HELIOPHYSICS DECADAL SURVEY: ANSWERS TWO HIGH LEVEL SCIENCE GOALS (1)  DETERMINE THE ORIGINS OF THE SUN S ACTIVITY AND PREDICT THE VARIATIONS IN THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT  AND (2)  DISCOVER AND CHARACTERIZE FUNDAMENTAL PROCESSES THAT OCCUR BOTH WITHIN THE HELIOSPHERE AND THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE.

IT ARISES BECAUSE THE FLUID CORE IS CONFINED WITHIN AN ELLIPSOIDAL MANTLE WHOSE ROTATION AND FIGURE AXES NEED NOT COINCIDE. IN THE TERRESTRIAL REFERENCE FRAME, THE ASSOCIATED MOTION IS A NEARLY DIURNAL FREE WOBBLE (NDFW). ANALYSIS OF THE FCN (OR THE NDFW) ALLOWS US TO STUDY CERTAIN UNIQUE PROPERTIES OF THE EARTH; A CLASSIC EXAMPLE (GWINN, 1986) WAS USING THE FCN TO DETERMINE THE ELLIPTICITY OF THE CORE-MANTLE BOUNDARY. OUR PROPOSAL AIMS TO IMPROVE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FCN EXCITATION AND DISSIPATION, AND THE GEOPHYSICAL INTERPRETATION OF FCN EFFECTS. AN IMPORTANT ASPECT IS TO IMPROVE THE MODELING OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE OBSERVED NUTATION, SINCE AN IMPROPER ACCOUNTING OF THESE CAN BIAS THE RESPONSE ESTIMATES. THE MAIN GOALS OF OUR STUDY ARE (A) TO OBTAIN IMPROVED AND SELF-CONSISTENT ESTIMATES OF COMPLIANCES THAT DESCRIBE THE RESPONSE OF THE NON-RIGID EARTH TO EXTERNAL TORQUES AND GEOPHYSICAL EXCITATIONS, ALONG WITH REALISTIC ERROR ESTIMATES; (B) TO CLOSE THE BUDGET OF THE EXCITATION AND DISSIPATION OF THE FCN OR TO ESTABLISH THAT THE BUDGET CANNOT BE CLOSED WITHIN UNCERTAINTIES OF GEODETIC OBSERVATIONS. OUR PRIMARY GEODETIC DATA WILL BE VERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY (VLBI) GROUP DELAYS. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY (1) INCORPORATING INTO OUR DATA ANALYSIS THE NON-GRAVITATIONAL FORCINGS FROM THE LATEST ADVANCED TIDAL AND NONTIDAL OCEANIC MODELS AND ATMOSPHERIC MODELS; (2) IMPROVING THE OCEAN TIDE MODEL AT PSI1 TIDE (CRITICAL BECAUSE ITS FREQUENCY IS SO CLOSE TO THE NDFW FREQUENCY); AND (3) ESTIMATING PARAMETERS OF THE NUTATION TRANSFER FUNCTION DIRECTLY FROM VLBI GROUP DELAYS WITHOUT RESORTING TO INTERMEDIATE TIME SERIES. IN PAST EFFORTS THE PSI1 OCEAN TIDE HAS NEVER BEEN HANDLED CORRECTLY. THIS IS BECAUSE, UNLIKE ANY OTHER TIDE, IT IS FORCED ABOUT EQUALLY BY THE GRAVITATIONAL TIDAL POTENTIAL AND BY RADIATIONAL EFFECTS OF THE ATMOSPHERIC TIDES. WE PROPOSE TO DETERMINE THE PSI1 BAROMETRIC PRESSURE TIDE FROM SEVERAL MODERN ANALYSES AND REANALYSES OF NUMERICAL WEATHER CENTERS. WE WILL BE GUIDED BY AN EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF BAROMETER MEASUREMENTS THAT WE HAVE BUILT UP OVER SEVERAL YEARS AND WHICH WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY USED TO STUDY THE S1 AND S2 AIR TIDES. WE WILL USE THE RESULTING AIR-TIDE MODEL TO FORCE A NUMERICAL OCEAN-TIDE MODEL THAT WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY USED TO STUDY THE S1 OCEAN TIDE. THE RESULTS, COMBINED WITH THE NOMINALLY EASIER GRAVITATIONAL PART, SHOULD RESULT IN A MUCH MORE REALISTIC MODEL OF THE PSI1 OCEAN TIDE THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO MITIGATE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS IN DETERMINING THE STRENGTH AND SHAPE OF THE FCN. WE WILL MODIFY THE WELL-KNOWN NEMO OCEAN MODEL TO COMPUTE OCEANIC ANGULAR MOMENTUM AND BOTTOM PRESSURE ON THE FLY AND TO STORE THESE DATA WITH A TIME RESOLUTION OF ONE HOUR. THE OCEAN DATA, COMBINED WITH PRESSURE AND WIND DATA FROM NUMERICAL WEATHER CENTERS, WILL SUPPLY NEW ANGULAR MOMENTUM CORRECTIONS FOR REANALYSIS OF VLBI NUTATION DATA, AGAIN LEADING TO BETTER DETERMINED FCN PARAMETERS. WE ANTICIPATE THE NEMO DATA WILL BENEFIT A WIDE RANGE OF EARTH SCIENCE STUDIES, NOT JUST OUR OWN. WE PROPOSE TO REANALYZE VLBI GROUP DELAYS FROM 1984 THROUGH PRESENT. WE WILL FIT PARAMETERS OF THE MODEL THAT RELATE THE OBSERVED SPECTRUM TO THE EXTERNAL GRAVITATIONAL EXCITATION EXERTED BY THE MOON, SUN, AND PLANETS AND TO INTERNAL EXCITATIONS CAUSED BY THE OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC DYNAMICS.

THE DEVICE UTILIZES TWO-PHASE HEAT TRANSFER AND NOVEL GEOMETRIC FEATURES THAT ADAPTIVELY (AND REVERSIBLY) ADJUST THE VIEW FACTOR IN RESPONSE TO INTERNAL PRESSURE IN THE RADIATOR. THE RADIATOR FOLDS INTO A CLOSED SHAPE TO MINIMIZE THE VIEW FACTOR WHEN COLD, AND OPENS UP TO MAXIMIZE THE VIEW FACTOR WHEN HEATED. PROTOTYPES DEMONSTRATED IN PHASE I PROVE THE FEASIBILITY AND HIGHLIGHT THE ADVANTAGES OF A TWO-PHASE RADIATOR OVER SHAPE MEMORY ALLOY TECHNOLOGIES. STRUCTURAL AND THERMAL SIMULATION STUDIES CONFIRMED THE VIABILITY OF THE CONCEPT. AT LOW TEMPERATURES, THE VIEW FACTOR OF EMISSIVE SURFACES OF THE RADIATOR TO THE HEAT SINK IS NEAR ZERO, SO THE ONLY HEAT LOST IS THAT WHICH IS EMITTED FROM THE INSULATED OUTER SURFACES OF THE RADIATOR. THE FLEXIBLE SECTION OF THE RADIATOR IS AN ELASTIC ENVELOPE ENCLOSING A SATURATED WORKING FLUID. WHEN THE TEMPERATURE OF THE RADIATOR INCREASES, THE CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN VAPOR PRESSURE GENERATES A NET FORCE ON THE INTERIOR WALLS OF THE ENVELOPE WHICH CAUSES THE ELASTIC WALLS TO BEND SO THAT THE STRUCTURE OPENS AND THE VIEW FACTOR INCREASES. THE INCREASE IN VIEW FACTOR REDUCES THERMAL RESISTANCE OF HEAT REJECTION WHICH ENABLES INHERENTLY PASSIVE THERMAL CONTROL. ADDITIONALLY, THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE OF THE RADIATOR CONSISTS OF CAVITIES FILLED WITH SATURATED FLUID ACTING LIKE HEAT PIPES, SO THE RADIATING SURFACE WILL BE NEARLY ISOTHERMAL, ACHIEVING A RADIATOR PANEL EFFICIENCY NEAR ONE. IN PHASE I, MODELING AND PROTOTYPING INDICATES THAT THE BASELINE GEOMETRY PROPOSED CAN ACHIEVE A THERMAL TURNDOWN RATIO OF 37:1.",,,,

AT THE SAME TIME THE HEAT ACQUISITION AREAS HAVE TRENDED DOWNWARD, THEREBY INCREASING THE INCIDENT HEAT FLUX. CURRENT INCIDENT HEAT FLUX FOR LASER DIODE APPLICATIONS IS ON THE ORDER OF 5-10W/CM2, ALTHOUGH THIS IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE TOWARDS 50W/CM2. THIS IS A SEVERE LIMITATION FOR AXIAL GROOVE ALUMINUM/AMMONIA CONSTANT CONDUCTANCE HEAT PIPES (CCHPS). THE MAXIMUM HEAT FLUX IN A CCHP IS SET BY THE BOILING LIMIT, WHICH TYPICALLY START AT 5 W/CM2 FOR AXIAL GROVE WICKS, AND 20-30 W/CM2 FOR POWDER METAL WICKS. THE INNOVATION IS TO DEVELOP CCHPS WITH A HYBRID WICK, WHICH HAS A SINTERED EVAPORATOR WICK, AND A CONVENTIONAL GROOVED ADIABATIC AND CONDENSER WICK. THESE HYBRID WICKS CAN OPERATE AT HIGHER HEAT FLUXES, ALLOWING THE USE OF HIGHER POWER LASER DIODES. THEY ALSO ALLOW THE USE OF VARIABLE CONDUCTANCE HEAT PIPES (VCHPS) IN LUNAR AND MARTIAN LANDERS AND ROVERS, WHICH MUST OPERATE AT TILTS UP TO 45   . CONVENTIONAL ALUMINUM/AMMONIA HEAT PIPES CAN ONLY OPERATE WITH A 0.1 INCH TILT, SO THEY ARE UNSUITABLE. LOOP HEAT PIPES CAN ALSO OPERATE WITH TILTING, BUT THEY ARE TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE MORE EXPENSIVE. A HYBRID GROOVED AND SINTERED WICK CCHP WILL ALLOW OPERATING AT HIGHER HEAT FLUXES AS COMPARED TO AXIAL GROOVE DESIGN AND CAN ALSO OPERATE AGAINST GRAVITY ON THE PLANETARY SURFACE, OPERATE IN SPACE, CARRYING POWER OVER LONG DISTANCES, ACT AS A THERMOSYPHON ON THE PLANETARY SURFACE FOR LUNAR AND MARTIAN LANDERS AND ROVERS, AND DEMONSTRATE A HIGHER TRANSPORT CAPABILITY THAN AN ALL-SINTERED WICK.",,,,

THE PROPOSAL WILL PRIMARILY USE DATA PRODUCTS FROM CRISM, MCS AND MARCI ABOARD MRO. A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION OF THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE IN THE THERMAL AND METEOROLOGICAL MODELING \NECESSARY TO ANALYZE OR INTERPRET THE DATA\"" IN TERMS OF THE WATER AND DUST CYCLES. THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO ADDRESS FOUR MAJOR QUESTIONS: - HOW IS THE LOCAL CYCLE OF WATER (AND DUST) CONTROLLED AT SITES OBSERVED BY CRISM/MCS/MARCI? - CAN SUCH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTROLS ON SURFACE WATER EXCHANGE BE SUMMARIZED INTO A PROGNOSTIC FRAMEWORK LIKE A LAND SURFACE MODEL (LSM) IN TERRESTRIAL STUDIES? - HOW IS THE GLOBAL CYCLE OF WATER AND DUST CHANGED IF BETTER REPRESENTATIONS OF THE POLAR EXCHANGE PROCESSES ARE INCLUDED IN GLOBAL MODELS? - CAN THE SEASONAL PROGNOSTIC PICTURE OF ICE AND DUST DEPOSITION AT THE POLES BE USED TO HELP UNDERSTAND THE FORMATION OF POLAR LAYERED TERRAIN? THE LATTER QUESTION SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE MDAP CALL REGARDING \""NONDATA-ANALYSIS TASKS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE USE OR FACILITATE THE INTERPRETATION OF MISSION DATA\"" AS IT ALLOWS DATA ON CURRENT PROCESSES TO BE USED TO ADDRESS LONGER-TERM QUESTIONS IN MARTIAN CLIMATE DYNAMICS AND GEOLOGY. THE WATER CYCLE IS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE MARTIAN CLIMATE SYSTEM, YIELDING A SIGNIFICANT FEEDBACK ON THE CLIMATE THROUGH ITS EFFECTS ON SURFACE ALBEDO VIA FORMATION OF ICES AND ON ATMOSPHERIC EMISSIVITY AND REFLECTIVITY VIA CLOUDS. CLOUDS ALSO INTERACT WITH THE ATMOSPHERIC DUST DISTRIBUTION VIA THE MICROPHYSICS OF CLOUD PARTICLE EVOLUTION, YIELDING ADDITIONAL MODIFICATION OF ATMOSPHERIC RADIATIVE FORCING. WHILE THE MAJOR PROCESSES OF THE WATER CYCLE, AND ITS INTERACTIONS WITH THE DUST AND CO2 CYCLES, HAVE BEEN SKETCHED IN OUTLINE FOR SEVERAL DECADES, THE SPECIFICS OF HOW THE WATER CYCLE IS CONTROLLED REMAIN UNCERTAIN, E.G. THE IMPORTANCE OF REGOLITH EXCHANGE. THE NATURE OF THE NORTHERN CAP AS A DOMINANT WATER SOURCE AND THAT OF BOTH THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH AS SINKS AGAIN SEEMS CERTAIN IN OUTLINE, BUT THE DETAILS OF HOW THESE SOURCES AND SINKS FUNCTION HAS NOT RECEIVED MUCH ATTENTION AND MAY DOMINATE THE EFFICACY OF HOW THE WATER (AND RELATED CLIMATE) CYCLES ARE CONTROLLED GLOBALLY. CRISM DATA SUGGEST SIGNIFICANT LOCAL CYCLING AND IN SOME CASES BURIAL OF ANNUAL WATER LAYERS, WHICH IS LIKELY THE BASIS FOR POLAR LAYER FORMATION, AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHICH WOULD BE KEY TO UNRAVELING THE RECORD OF CLIMATE STORED IN THESE LAYERS. WE PROPOSE TO USE THE PLANETWRF MODELING SYSTEM TO UNDERTAKE IDEALIZED LOCAL THERMAL / WATER EXCHANGE MODELING OF SPECIFIC SITES OBSERVED BY CRISM, TO UNDERTAKE RESOLVED-SCALE SEASONAL MODELING OF THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CAPS, AND TO UNDERTAKE MULTI-ANNUAL MODELING OF THE CLIMATE SYSTEM USING LSM SCHEMES DEVELOPED WITHIN THIS PROJECT. NEW DATA PRODUCTS FROM CRISM WILL BE DEVELOPED AS NEEDED WITHIN THE ANALYSIS. THIS PROPOSAL IS RELEVANT TO THE MARS DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAM AS IT SEEKS TO UNDERTAKE WORK NECESSARY FOR THE ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF MARS SPACECRAFT MISSION DATA AND WILL HEAVILY USE MISSION DATA IN THE GENERATION OF IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF THE MARTIAN CLIMATE SYSTEM. IT WILL ALSO IMPROVE ATMOSPHERIC MODELS THAT FURTHER THE UNDERSTANDING AND FORECASTING OF ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT SAFE PASSAGE OF SPACECRAFT THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE. COLUMN WATER VAPOR ABUNDANCES RETRIEVED FROM CRISM SPECTRA WILL BE ARCHIVED AT NASA''S PDS ATMOSPHERES NODE.

THE INVESTIGATION PROPOSED HERE WILL GAIN INSIGHT BY DIRECT ANALYSIS OF THE DATASET, COMPARISON WITH NUMERICAL MODELING (BY MESOSCALE AND LARGE EDDY SIMULATION) OF THE LANDING SITE ATMOSPHERE, AND COMPARISON WITH MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY (MSL) ATMOSPHERIC DATA. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF WEATHER, DUST DEVIL ACTIVITY, AND AEOLIAN PROCESSES ON MARS VIA THE ANALYSIS OF INSIGHT MEASUREMENTS AND THEIR COMPARISON WITH ATMOSPHERIC MODEL PREDICTIONS. THIS GOAL IS ADDRESSED THROUGH FOUR, INTERRELATED INVESTIGATIONS: 1. DETERMINE THE CONTROLS ON THE DIURNAL AND SEASONAL PRESSURE CYCLE. HAVING ATMOSPHERIC DATA AT TWO LOCATIONS (MSL AND INSIGHT) IS VERY VALUABLE. MSL IS AT A SIMILAR LONGITUDE AND ONLY 9DEG AWAY IN LATITUDE, BUT WITH VERY DIFFERENT LOCAL TOPOGRAPHY AND IN THE OPPOSITE HEMISPHERE, HENCE REGULAR MSL PRESSURE MONITORING MAY BE COMBINED WITH CONTINUOUS INSIGHT MONITORING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF DIFFERENT CIRCULATION COMPONENTS (FROM THE CO2 CYCLE AND HADLEY CELL TO TIDES AND TRAVELING WAVES TO CRATER TOPOGRAPHY) TO THE SEASONAL AND DIURNAL PRESSURE CYCLES. 2. UNDERSTAND REGIONAL FLOWS NEAR THE DICHOTOMY BOUNDARY. ALTHOUGH MSL''S WIND SENSOR IS NO LONGER IN USE, THE SEASONAL RECORD OF WINDS IN GALE WILL BE COMPARED WITH INSIGHT WINDS TO BUILD A BETTER PICTURE OF THE REGIONAL FLOW IN THIS AREA. COMPARISON WITH MODELS WILL BE USED TO ASSESS THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE HADLEY OVERTURNING CIRCULATION, DICHOTOMY BOUNDARY SLOPE FLOWS, TIDAL FLOWS, ETC. TO THE PATTERN OF WINDS IN THIS REGION. 3. UNDERSTAND VORTEX ACTIVITY. SHORT, DEEP PRESSURE DROPS WILL BE USED TO INDICATE CONVECTIVE VORTEX PASSAGE. THEIR DEPENDENCE ON TIME OF DAY AND SEASON ARE IMPORTANT FOR CONSTRAINING OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE BOUNDARY LAYER WHERE THEY FORM AND ALSO VITAL TO UNDERSTAND A MAJOR MECHANISM OF DUST LIFTING. AN IN SITU DATASET OF BOTH VORTICES AND THE ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS IN WHICH THEY FORMED, AT ONE LOCATION OVER MULTIPLE SEASONS, WILL BE INVALUABLE BOTH FOR UNDERSTANDING THEIR DEPENDENCE ON ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS AND FOR VALIDATING MODELS AND THEORIES OF VORTEX PRODUCTION AND DUST DEVIL-BASED DUST LIFTING. BOTH MESOSCALE AND LES MODELING WILL BE USED TO PREDICT VORTEX ACTIVITY, WITH A COMPARISON WITH OBSERVATIONS USED TO INDICATE DEFICIENCIES IN THE MODELS OR THEORY. 4. MONITOR AEOLIAN ACTIVITY AND INFER THRESHOLDS FOR PARTICLE MOTION. WIND DATA WILL BE COMPARED WITH A) TEMPORAL CHANGES IN AEOLIAN FEATURES AND B) CHANGES IN SURFACE SOIL, DECK, OR SOLAR PANEL DUST COVER BETWEEN TWO IMAGES, IN ORDER TO INFER PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT, SUCH AS THE THRESHOLD FOR SALTATION. AEOLIAN FEATURE CHARACTERISTICS WILL ALSO BE PREDICTED USING WIND DATA AND MODEL OUTPUT AND COMPARED WITH OBSERVATIONS TO ASSESS AEOLIAN THEORY AND MODEL PERFORMANCE. THE PI HAS SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE IN WORKING ON SUCH INVESTIGATIONS AS A MEMBER OF THE MSL SCIENCE TEAM [E.G. BRIDGES ET AL., 2017]. THE PI WILL PARTICIPATE STRONGLY IN THE ATMOSPHERE THEME GROUP, AS SHE DOES IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL THEME GROUP ON MSL, AND ALSO IN THE GEOLOGY THEME GROUP, TO E.G. HELP INTERPRET / DISSEMINATE METEOROLOGICAL DATA AND PROVIDE INPUT INTO WHEN HIGHER RESOLUTION DATA SHOULD BE SOUGHT. THE PI IS AN ASSOCIATE TEAM MEMBER ON REMS AND A CO-I ON THE MARS ENVIRONMENTAL DYNAMICS ANALYZER ON MARS2020, WITH STRONG EXPERTISE IN WORKING WITH MARS IN SITU ATMOSPHERIC DATA IN GENERAL, AND IN PARTICULAR WITH THE WIND SENSORS TO BE FLOWN ON INSIGHT.

BY REDUCING THE CONTROL COMPLEXITY, NOT ONLY ARE THE PHASED ARRAY DEVICES SIMPLIFIED, BUT THE CONTROL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK IS SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED. THIS SIMPLIFICATION RIPPLES ACROSS THE ENTIRE PHASED ARRAY TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL INTEGRATION AND THERMAL MANAGEMENT WHICH OFTEN COST AS MUCH AS THE PHASED ARRAY COMPONENTS.

THESE ARE THE PRIMARY SCIENCE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CUBESAT SYSTEM. THE CUBESAT SHALL PROVIDE ADEQUATE SHIELDING FROM EARTHS ALBEDO RADIATION AND FROM THE HEAT GENERATED BY THE CUBESAT ITSELF USING SUCH THAT THE COATED SAMPLE IS NOT ADVERSELY HEATED.  THE CUBESAT SHALL INCLUDE A METHOD OF ATTACHING THE SAMPLE TO THE CUBESAT SUCH THAT MINIMAL HEAT IS CONDUCTED TO THE SAMPLE UNDER TEST. THE CUBESAT SHALL MAINTAIN ORIENTATION OF THE COATED SAMPLE TOWARD DEEP SPACE.  TWO TEMPERATURE SENSORS PER EACH SAMPLE WHERE ONE SHALL BE USED TO MEASURE THE SAMPLE TEMPERATURE LOCATED IN THE SMALL METALLIC OBJECT UNDER THE COATING AND THE OTHER SHALL BE USED TO MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WALL AND STRUCTURE CLOSEST TO THE SAMPLE.  HUNDREDS OF PAPERS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED ON DESIGNING SURFACES THAT REFLECT ONE WAVELENGTH RANGE WHILE ABSORBING ANOTHER IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT TEMPERATURE INCREASES OR DECREASES OF THESE SURFACES IN SUNLIGHT. THE MAJORITY OF THIS WORK WAS DEVOTED TO ACHIEVING HIGH TEMPERATURES TO SUPPORT, FOR EXAMPLE, SOLAR FURNACE OPERATION, BUT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION WAS DIRECTED TO COOLING. COATINGS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO ALLOW A SURFACE IN SUNLIGHT TO COOL BELOW AMBIENT, BUT ATMOSPHERIC LIMITATIONS, INFRARED TRANSMISSION WINDOWS AND CONVECTIVE WARMING, PREVENT SIGNIFICANT COOLING. HOWEVER, HIBBARD, OF THE LEWIS RESEARCH CENTER, REALIZED THAT IN SPACE, AWAY FROM THESE ATMOSPHERIC LIMITATIONS, THAT SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER COOLING COULD BE ACHIEVED. SINCE THEN, A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TESTING HAS BEEN COMPLETED ON MANY DIFFERENT COATING MATERIALS. THE RESULTS OF THIS TESTING SHOW THAT WHEN COMBINED WITH MULTI-LAYER INSULATION TO SHIELD FROM EARTH RADIATION, IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO PASSIVELY COOL A COMPONENT TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOW TEMPERATURES. THESE TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO PASSIVELY STORE CRYOGENS IN SPACE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.  CUBESATS RECENTLY HAVE BECOME POPULAR IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY.  CUBESAT IS A TYPE OF SPACECRAFT THAT TYPICALLY USES COMMERCIAL, OFF-THE-SHELF ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS IN A SCALABLE CUBESAT FORM FACTOR WITH A MASS OF ONE KG AND A VOLUME OF TEN CUBIC CENTIMETERS.

ACHIEVING HIGH THERMAL EFFICIENCIES AND RELIABILITY WHILE MAINTAINING VOLUMETRIC AND MASS EFFICIENCY HAS BEEN THE KEY CHALLENGE WITH THESE KINDS OF REFRIGERATION/FREEZING SYSTEMS IN A MICROGRAVITY ENVIRONMENT. PREVIOUS STATE OF THE ART REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE ISS RFR, USE THERMOELECTRIC THERMAL CONTROL WITH VERY LOW OVERALL SYSTEM COP OF AROUND 0.36 (IN FREEZER MODE). ALTERNATIVELY, TERRESTRIAL COLD FOOD STORAGE SYSTEMS UTILIZE MUCH MORE EFFICIENT VAPOR COMPRESSION THERMAL CONTROL SYSTEMS, MAKING THE SYSTEMS LIGHTER AND MORE COMPACT. CURRENTLY, THESE SYSTEMS DO NOT HAVE PROVISIONS TO FULFILL THE LOAD AND RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS OF SPACE APPLICATIONS AND ARE ALSO NOT DESIGNED FOR MICROGRAVITY OPERATION. AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE KELVINATOR KCCF220QW CHEST FREEZER. THIS FREEZER CAN MAINTAIN TEMPERATURES AS LOW AS 26 C AT COPS OF AROUND 2.2 TO 2.4. AIR SQUARED IS PROPOSING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A ZERO-GRAVITY VAPOR COMPRESSION REFRIGERATOR (ZVCR). THE ZVCR IS AN OIL-FREE, SCROLL DRIVEN, VAPOR COMPRESSION FOOD STORAGE SYSTEM THAT IS THERMALLY EFFICIENT, LIGHTWEIGHT AND RELIABLE. SIMILAR TO CONVENTIONAL SYSTEMS, THE ZVCR WILL INCLUDE FOUR MAJOR COMPONENTS: COMPRESSOR, CONDENSER, EXPANSION DEVICE AND EVAPORATOR. BUT, INSTEAD OF A HEAVY AND OIL LUBRICATED WORKING FLUID COMPRESSOR, IT WILL USE AN ADVANCED OIL-FREE ORBITING TYPE SCROLL COMPRESSOR AND EXPANDER DEVELOPED BY AIR SQUARED. ITS OIL-FREE DESIGN WILL REMOVE SYSTEM S OPERATIONAL RELIANCE ON GRAVITY WHILE KEEPING THE DESIGN COMPACT&LIGHTWEIGHT AT HIGHER EFFICIENCIES. FOR EXPANSION WORK RECOVERY, A SCROLL EXPANDER BASED ON THE SAME TECHNOLOGY AS THE COMPRESSOR WILL BE USED TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE SYSTEM S PERFORMANCE. CUSTOM HEAT EXCHANGERS WILL BE DESIGNED FOR EFFICIENT OPERATION IN MICROGRAVITY WHILE CONSIDERING THE SIZE, WEIGHT AND RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS.",,,,

THE PRIMARY GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A VERSATILE PROOF OF CONCEPT CSSP, CAPABLE OF PUMPING LIQUID OR TWO-PHASE METHANE OR OXYGEN AT A WIDE RANGE OF SPEEDS (I.E. 1,000-8,000 RPM) AND A WIDE RANGE OF DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURES WHILE MAINTAINING HIGH-RELIABILITY AND A COMPACT SIZE. THE PUMP WILL BE CONFIGURABLE, TO ALLOW MULTIPLE PUMPS TO BE PLACED IN SERIES FOR HIGH-PRESSURE MULTI-STAGE OPERATION. DURING PHASE I, AIR SQUARED SUCCESSFULLY DESIGNED, FABRICATED AND TESTED A PROTOTYPE CSSP ON LIQUID NITROGEN. FOR CRYOGENIC PUMPING, STATE OF THE ART (SOA), CONSISTS OF TWO VASTLY DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY OPTIONS. CENTRIFUGAL TURBOPUMPS AND POSITIVE DISPLACEMENT PUMPS. TURBOPUMPS UTILIZE AN IMPELLER-INDUCER COMBINATION THAT RELIES ON HIGH IMPELLER SPEEDS TO CREATE A DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE. WHILE THE HIGH-SPEED OPERATION MAKES TURBOPUMPS COMPACT, IT ALSO LIMITS BEARING LIFE, DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE, AND THEY CAN''T HANDLE TWO-PHASE FLOW. POSITIVE DISPLACEMENT PUMPS CAN HANDLE LARGER PRESSURE DIFFERENTIALS AND DON''T HAVE ISSUES WITH TWO-PHASE FLOW. HOWEVER, THEY CAN''T ACHIEVE SPEEDS OVER 3,000 RPM WITHOUT BULKY AND HIGH-LOAD BEARINGS MAKING THEM LESS DESIRABLE FOR AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS. THE CSSP OFFERS THE BEST OF BOTH OPTIONS. AS A POSITIVE DISPLACEMENT PUMP, IT CAN ACHIEVE HIGH-PRESSURES WITH MINIMAL REDUCTION IN FLOW AND PUMP SATURATED LIQUIDS AT LOW NET-POSITIVE SUCTION HEADS. DUE TO THE SPINNING MOTION OF THE PUMP, VARIOUS CENTRIFUGAL LOADS ARE ELIMINATED ALLOWING SPEEDS OVER 8,000 RPM POSSIBLE AND MAKING THE DESIGN COMPACT AND LIGHTWEIGHT. ADDITIONALLY, THE SPINNING MOTION OF THE SCROLLS ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR A COUNTERBALANCE COMMON IN ORBITING SCROLL DESIGNS. THIS FURTHER REDUCES WEIGHT BY ELIMINATING COUNTERWEIGHTS AND EASES BEARING LOADS. AIR SQUARED BELIEVES THE PROPOSED CSSP IS A PERFECT FIT IN SUPPORT OF METHANE IN-SPACE PROPULSION.",,,,

THE PHASE II EFFORT WILL TAKE THIS INFORMATION AND USE IT IN A REAL WORLD APPLICATION, EXISTING ADVANCED PLANETARY EXPLORATION SUITS BEARINGS. SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON THE Z-1 SERIES SUITS HIP AND WAIST, AND ALSO THE Z-2 SERIES HIP BEARINGS. THESE ARE AREAS THAT ARE KNOWN TO HAVE LARGE CONTACT STRESSES DUE TO NON-UNIFORM LOADING THROUGH AXIAL RESTRAINT LINES. THIS LOADING YIELDS INCREASED STRESSES IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE RACE. WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE MAX EXPECTED STRESS, THE BEARING DESIGN CAN BE MADE TO ACCOMMODATE ALL CONTACT STRESSES APPLIED TO THE RACE. THE PHASE II EFFORT WILL CONSIST OF FINDING THE MAXIMUM EXPECTED CONTACT STRESSES IN THESE BEARINGS THROUGH BOTH TEST AND FEA SIMULATION. THE BEARING DESIGNS CAN THEN BE OPTIMIZED TO REDUCE THE CONTACT STRESSES IN THESE AREAS. AIR-LOCK WILL MANUFACTURE DVT UNITS IN ORDER TO CYCLE TEST THE OPTIMIZED BEARINGS.

IMPORTANTLY, THEY CAN ALSO BE USED TO ADDRESS THE PERSISTENT QUESTION OF THE NATURE OF THE LUNAR IMPACT FLUX. THIS PROJECT INVOLVES ANALYZING IMPACT GLASSES FROM SELECTED APOLLO 14, 15, 16, AND 17 REGOLITH SAMPLES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE MORE DATA THAT CAN BE USED TO EVALUATE THE NATURE OF THE LUNAR IMPACT FLUX. DECIPHERING THE LUNAR IMPACT HISTORY IS A COMPLEX PROCESS AND MANY TYPES OF SAMPLES ARE BEING STUDIED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. LUNAR IMPACT GLASSES ARE NUMEROUS; THEIR COMPOSITIONS TELL US WHERE THEY WERE FORMED, WHILE THEIR 40AR/39AR AGES TELL US WHEN THEY WERE FORMED. THUS, LUNAR IMPACT GLASSES CAN PROVIDE USEFUL INSIGHT INTO THE IMPACT RATE IN THE EARTH-MOON SYSTEM. HUNDREDS OF LUNAR IMPACT GLASSES HAVE BEEN SELECTED FROM SAMPLES 14259, 15221, 64501, 66041, AND 71501. COMPOSITIONS AND AGES OF THESE GLASSES CAN BE USED TO CONSTRAIN THE TIMING OF THE LUNAR IMPACT FLUX. METHODOLOGY: MAJOR- AND TRACE-ELEMENT ANALYSES ON THE LUNAR GLASS SAMPLES WILL BE DONE BY ELECTRON MICROPROBE AND LASER ABLATION ICPMS, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE THE ARGON ISOTOPES WILL BE MEASURED BY THE THERMO ARGUS VI MULTI-COLLECTOR NOBLE GAS MASS SPECTROMETER AT CURTIN UNIVERSITY. THIS STATE-OF-THE-ART INSTRUMENT HAS HIGH SENSITIVITY AND IS PARTICULARLY WELL-SUITED FOR ISOTOPIC ANALYSES OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF ARGON. WE WILL THEN COMPARE OUR NEW RESULTS TO EXISTING DATA, WITH THE GOAL OF ADDING TO THE 40AR/39AR DATA SETS OF LUNAR SAMPLE AGES IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF LUNAR IMPACTS OVER TIME. RELEVANCE: LUNAR GLASSES PROVIDE COMPOSITIONAL INFORMATION, WHICH IS USEFUL FOR CHARACTERIZING THE CHEMICAL AND MINERALOGICAL FEATURES OF THE LUNAR SURFACE. AGES OF IMPACT GLASSES CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT RATE IN THE EARTH-MOON SYSTEM (AND PERHAPS THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM), A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IN LUNAR SCIENCE. RESULTS FROM THESE STUDIES WILL ELUCIDATE THE EVOLUTION AND MODIFICATION OF THE LUNAR SURFACE AND ADDRESS THE NATURE OF THE LUNAR IMPACT FLUX. THESE TASKS WILL LEAD TO RESULTS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW OBJECTS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM HAVE EVOLVED.",,,,

THE VERY SUCCESSFUL NASA LED X-43A HYPERSONIC FLIGHT PROVED THE ABILITY TO USE STATE OF THE ART (SOTA) 2D C-C WITH OXIDATION COATING SYSTEM. HOWEVER, CURRENT MATERIAL SYSTEMS CAN ONLY OFFER LIMITED TEMPERATURE CAPABILITY (<3000  F) AND MOSTLY FOR SINGLE USE APPLICATION. IN PHASE I, TWO INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, UNDERCOAT AND FGM MULTI-LAYER COATS, WERE DEVELOPED AND SCREENED. THEY WERE FURTHER INTEGRATED INTO TWO SOTA C-C COMPOSITES. OXIDATION PROTECTED C-C SAMPLES WERE TORCH TESTED AT 3500 F/ 30 MINUTES, AT 4200 F/ 2 MINUTES UP TO 10 CYCLES, AND AT 3000 F/COOL/ 4000 F CYCLES SHOWING VERY PROMISING RESULTS. THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF THE UNDERCOAT AND FGM SPRAY COATS PROVIDE REPEATABLE PERFORMANCE BY CREATING A GLASS FORMING, CONFORMING AND ADHERENT EXTERNAL COATING TO PROTECT THE C-C FROM BEING OXIDIZED. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED P-II IS TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND OPTIMIZE A ROBUST, TAILORABLE, AND AFFORDABLE OXIDATION PROTECTION SYSTEM FOR C-C TPS AND C-C HOT STRUCTURE BY INTEGRATING OUR UNDERCOAT AND FGM MULTI-LAYER SPRAY COAT TECHNOLOGIES INTO AT LEAST TWO GRADES C-C COMPOSITES (T300 AND P30 2D C-C) MEETING HIGHER TEMPERATURE PERFORMANCE UP TO 4500 F AND MULTI-USE APPLICATIONS. WORK PLAN INCLUDES 12 TASKS OVER 24 MONTH GROUPED INTO 5 CATEGORIES. ONCE FURTHER OPTIMIZED AND VALIDATED UNDER PHASE II, THESE TECHNOLOGIES CAN EASILY BE INTEGRATED INTO SOTA C-C USING CURRENT MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. THE RESULTING OXIDATION PROTECTED C-C COULD BE TAILORABLE, AFFORDABLE, AND EASILY SCALED UP FOR LARGE COMPONENTS OR STRUCTURE REQUIRED IN FUTURE NASA, DOD AND COMMERCIAL SPACE APPLICATIONS.",,,,

SUCH ANALYTIC TOOLS MUST ALSO BE STREAMLINED AND READILY MASTERED BY RESEARCHERS MAKING SCIENTIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS. IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL CREATE SOFTWARE TO ASSESS BIODIVERSITY CHANGE INDICATORS BY BUILDING ON THE RECENTLY DEVELOPED SOFTWARE WALLACE AS A NEW GEO BON IN A BOX TOOL. WALLACE IS AN R-BASED APPLICATION WITH A GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE THAT SUPPORTS SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELING (SDM) IN A REPRODUCIBLE, FLEXIBLE AND EXTENSIBLE PLATFORM TO FACILITATE A WIDE RANGE OF ECOLOGICAL ANALYSES. THESE MODELS CHARACTERIZE ENVIRONMENTAL SUITABILITY FOR SPECIES AND CAN BE USED TO ESTIMATE SPECIES  GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS  A GEO BON ESSENTIAL BIODIVERSITY VARIABLE (EBV). WALLACE HARNESSES BIODIVERSITY DATA FROM ONLINE DATABASES OR USER INPUT, ASSEMBLES A VARIETY OF TOOLS FOR BUILDING AND EVALUATING MODELS, AND OFFERS GUIDANCE FOR IMPORTANT CONCEPTUAL AND METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES. CRITICALLY, ITS MODULAR NATURE FACILITATES THE ADDITION OF NEW, CUTTING-EDGE INNOVATIONS BY OTHER PROGRAMMERS, AS WE PROPOSE HERE. TO EXPAND WALLACE AS A NEW BON IN A BOX, WE WILL DEVELOP TWO NEW R PACKAGES TO BE INTEGRATED AS NEW MODULES FOR WALLACE S WORKFLOW TO FACILITATE BIODIVERSITY CHANGE INDICATOR CALCULATIONS FOR GEO BON ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE COLOMBIA BON AS A MODEL. THE FIRST PACKAGE WILL USE SINGLE SPECIES RANGE MAPS IN CONJUNCTION WITH REMOTELY SENSED (RS) PRODUCTS TO ESTIMATE THE SPECIES  CURRENT RANGE. IT WILL HARNESS RS PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM NASA (AND OTHER) SATELLITES, INCLUDING PERCENT FOREST COVER, VEGETATION CLASSES, AND NDVI, WHICH CAN BE SPATIO-TEMPORALLY MATCHED WITH RECENT IN SITU OBSERVATIONS OF SPECIES  OCCURRENCE TO DETERMINE HABITAT TOLERANCES (E.G., TO LAND USE CHANGE). THE SECOND PACKAGE WILL ALLOW CALCULATION OF KEY INDICATORS INCLUDING SINGLE-SPECIES BIODIVERSITY CHANGE INDICATORS SUCH AS RANGE SIZE, EXTENT OF OCCURRENCE, PERCENT SUITABLE LAND COVER, OR PROJECTED TRENDS UNDER FUTURE SCENARIOS AT MULTIPLE SPATIAL EXTENTS. CALCULATIONS WILL ALSO INCLUDE MULTI-SPECIES INDICATORS, SUCH AS THE EBV TAXONOMIC DIVERSITY, AND OTHERS NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED THROUGH OTHER BON IN A BOX TOOLS, WITH A FOCUS ON ONES MOST USEFUL AT REGIONAL SCALES. MODULE OUTPUTS FROM WALLACE WILL BE DESIGNED TO FEED DIRECTLY INTO OTHER BON IN A BOX TOOLS, SUCH AS OUR INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATOR INSTITUTO HUMBOLDT S BIOMODELOS. BIOMODELOS IS A WEB APPLICATION ENABLING EXPERT VALIDATION OF SPECIES RANGE ESTIMATES IN SUPPORT OF THE COLOMBIA BON. WE WILL ALSO DEVELOP TRAINING MATERIALS FOR WALLACE TARGETING CONSERVATION PRACTITIONERS THAT REFLECT BEST PRACTICES FOR USING SDM FOR BIODIVERSITY CHANGE INDICATOR CALCULATIONS, RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION DECISION-MAKING. OUR PROJECT RESULTS WILL ADDRESS CHALLENGES TO OVERCOMING THE GAP BETWEEN BEST MODELING PRACTICES AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION DECISION-MAKING AND WILL FACILITATE RESPONSIBLE REPORTING ON BIODIVERSITY BY NATIONAL BONS. VIA FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND ENHANCEMENT OF OPEN-SOURCE, USER-FRIENDLY SOFTWARE TO CONTRIBUTE TO BON IN A BOX, OUR PROPOSAL WILL ADVANCE BROAD APPLICATION, EXPLORATION, VISUALIZATION, AND UNDERSTANDING OF EBVS AND GENERATION OF EBV DATA. FURTHERMORE, DEVELOPING A CONNECTION BETWEEN WALLACE AND BIOMODELOS, ANOTHER BON IN A BOX TOOL, WILL BE VALUABLE FOR FUTURE INTERFACING WITH EFFORTS AT IUCN, BIEN (THE BOTANICAL INFORMATION AND ECOLOGY NETWORK), AND OTHER SIMILAR PROJECTS THAT USE SDM PREDICTIONS AS INPUTS.

ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARAMETERS FOR ALL STUDIES OF GALACTIC AND PLANETARY EVOLUTION IS TO GET AN IDEA OF THE AGE OF THE OBJECT YOU ARE STUDYING. IN GENERAL, DETERMINING THE AGE OF A STAR IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR FULLY CONVECTIVE M DWARFS, WHERE SOLAR TYPE AGE DIAGNOSTICS BREAKDOWN. WHILE THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF M DWARF AGE INDICATORS THAT DO EXTEND OR WORK INDEPENDENTLY -- SUCH AS POPULATION KINEMATICS, UV AND X-RAY ACTIVITY, AND H? ANALYSIS -- THESE RELATIONS NEED BETTER CALIBRATIONS AND A UNIFIED METHOD FOR CHECKING THE AGE THAT EACH PREDICTS. KEPLER HAS THE ABILITY TO REVOLUTIONIZE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF M DWARF AGES.

LIKE JUPITER, BROWN DWARFS EXPERIENCE WEATHER PATTERNS, DETECTED AS PHOTOMETRIC OR TIME-RESOLVED SPECTROSCOPIC VARIABILITY DUE TO PHOTOSPHERIC INHOMOGENEITIES AND THEIR RAPID ROTATION. IN BROWN DWARFS COLDER THAN 1900K, VARIABILITY IS CAUSED BY HETEROGENEOUS CLOUD COVERAGE IN THEIR ATMOSPHERES. PATCHINESS IN CLOUDS AND VARYING OPACITIES ALLOW LIGHT FROM DEEPER LAYERS OF THE ATMOSPHERE TO REACH THE SURFACE OF THE PHOTOSPHERE. UNDERSTANDING VARIABILITY AND THE VERTICAL STRUCTURE OF BROWN DWARF ATMOSPHERES IS A CRUCIAL STEP TOWARDS DETAILED CHARACTERIZATION OF EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERES AND THEIR WEATHER SYSTEMS, AS YOUNG BROWN DWARFS OVERLAP IN TEMPERATURES AND SURFACE GRAVITIES WITH GIANT EXOPLANETS. IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS, JWST AND GROUND-BASED 30M TELESCOPES WILL ACHIEVE EXQUISITE DETAIL IN BROWN DWARF AND EXOPLANET OBSERVATIONS, POSSIBLY EVEN TO BEGIN THE SEARCH FOR BIOSIGNATURES IN EXOPLANET SPECTRA. THEREFORE, IT IS CRUCIAL AND TIMELY TO PURSUE DETAILED SPECTROSCOPIC STUDIES TO CHARACTERIZE LOW TEMPERATURE ATMOSPHERES. VARIABILITY SURVEYS UNTIL NOW HAVE BEEN UNINFORMED, AS THERE IS NO METHOD TO IDENTIFY VARIABLE BROWN DWARF CANDIDATES A PRIORI, AND BOTH LIGHT CURVES AND TIME-RESOLVED SPECTROSCOPY ARE RESOURCE-INTENSIVE OBSERVATIONAL TECHNIQUES. WE PROPOSE A TECHNIQUE TO IDENTIFY CANDIDATE VARIABLE BROWN DWARFS FROM A SINGLE, LOW-RESOLUTION, NEAR-INFRARED SPECTRUM TO INFORM THESE SEARCHES. THE SPECTRAL SIGNATURES RESULTING FROM INHOMOGENEOUS CLOUD COVERAGE AND LEADING TO PHOTOMETRIC VARIABILITY ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE FROM BLENDEDLIGHT SPECTRAL BINARIES. ESSENTIALLY, BOTH SPECTRA LOOK LIKE A BLEND OF TWO DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE ATMOSPHERES. SPECTRAL BINARIES ARE SYSTEMS OF ULTRACOOL DWARFS OF DIFFERENT SUBTYPES WHOSE PROXIMITY IN ANGULAR SPACE YIELDS A SINGLE, UNRESOLVED PECULIAR SPECTRUM. THE PATCHINESS IN CLOUD COVERAGE AND VARYING CLOUD OPACITIES, ALLOW THE OBSERVER TO PEER DEEPER INTO HOTTER LAYERS OF THE ATMOSPHERE, LEADING TO A SIMILAR BLENDED-LIGHT EFFECT ON THE SPECTRUM OF A SINGLE VARIABLE OBJECT.

KEPLER HAS REVEALED FREQUENT SUPERFLARES ON SOLAR-TYPE STARS, PROVIDING A MECHANISM BY WHICH HOST STARS MAY HAVE PROFOUND EFFECTS ON THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL EVOLUTION OF EXOPLANETARY ATMOSPHERES. WHAT EFFECT DO EXTREME ENERGY FLUXES FROM ERUPTIVE EVENTS DURING EARLY STELLAR EVOLUTION TOGETHER WITH UV LIGHT HAVE ON PREBIOTIC CHEMISTRY, IN PARTICULAR ON THE PRODUCTION OF SMALL MOLECULE PRECURSORS CURRENTLY THOUGHT NECESSARY FOR NUCLEOSIDE SYNTHESIS, AND BY CONSEQUENCE THE ORIGIN OF LIFE ON PRIMITIVE PLANETS? THIS MAY BE IMPORTANT IN TERRESTRIAL PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES, WHERE SPECIES SUCH AS MOLECULAR NITROGEN AND CARBON DIOXIDE WOULD REQUIRE HIGH ENERGY IRRADIATION IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE RECOMBINED INTO REACTIVE SPECIES SUCH AS HCN AND NOX, THE FORMER OF WHICH IS CONSIDERED CRUCIAL FOR NUCLEOSIDE FORMATION   AN OUTSTANDING CHALLENGE IN THE FIELD. OUR PROPOSAL AIMS TO ADDRESS THESE MAJOR QUESTIONS BY PERFORMING COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF IONIZING RADIATION INITIATED BY ENERGETIC ERUPTIVE EVENTS INCLUDING SUPERFLARES FROM YOUNG STARS AND ASSOCIATED PARTICLE EVENTS ON THE PREBIOTIC CHEMISTRY OF THE EARLY EARTH AND ITS TWINS. FIRST, WE WILL CALIBRATE ATMOSPHERIC PHOTO-COLISSIONAL CHEMICAL MODELS USING EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION OF GAS AND AQUEOUS PHASE CHEMISTRY. SECOND, WE WILL CHARACTERIZE THE PROCESSES OF NITROGEN FIXATION AND THE CHAIN OF REACTIONS PRODUCING NOX, N2O, HCN AND OTHER N-CONTAINING SPECIES IN A GAS- AND LATER LIQUID-PHASE THAT MAY EVENTUALLY FORM ORGANIC MOLECULES OF VARYING DEGREES OF COMPLEXITY ESPECIALLY THOSE RELEVANT IN THE PREBIOTIC SYNTHESIS OF NUCLEOSIDES, NOTABLY RNA. METHODOLOGY. WE WILL EMPLOY OUR 1D PHOTO-COLLISIONAL ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY MODEL TO COMPUTE THE CHEMICAL FORMATION RATES OF COMPLEX ORGANIC MOLECULES INCLUDING O- AND N-CONTAINING HYDROCARBONS IN THE GAS PHASE. THESE SIMULATIONS WILL ALLOW TO US INVESTIGATE THE VIABLE PHOTOCHEMICAL MECHANISMS FOR NITROGEN AND OXYGEN FIXATION INTO COMPLEX ORGANIC MOLECULES IN THE ATMOSPHERES OF EARLY EARTH AND MARS. THESE SIMULATIONS WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN EXPERIMENTS THAT EXPLORE THE STEADY-STATE GAS COMPOSITION OF N2/CO2/H2O GAS MIXTURES, ALONE AND IN COMBINATION WITH MINOR AMOUNTS OF CO OR CH4, EXPOSED TO A VARIETY OF ENERGY SOURCES INCLUDING PARTICLES, ELECTRIC DISCHARGES AND UV LIGHT, AS WELL AS THE NATURE OF THE WATER SOLUBLE SPECIES WHEN GENERATED IN THE PRESENCE OF AN AQUEOUS PHASE HELD AT VARIOUS PH VALUES THAT SIMULATE PRIMITIVE PLANETARY STANDING WATER BODIES. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES WILL BE CONDUCTED BY FLOWING 0.1 TO 1 ATM TOTAL PRESSURE GAS MIXTURES CONTAINING VARIOUS PARTIAL PRESSURES OF CO2 AND N2 TOGETHER WITH ADMIXTURES OF LESSER AMOUNTS OF H2O, CO, H2 OR CH4. THESE WILL BE IRRADIATED BY A PROTON GUN, UV LAMP AND ELECTRIC DISCHARGE. STEADY-STATE GAS COMPOSTIONS WILL BE MEASURED DOWNSTREAM FROM THE REACTION CHAMBER USING A RESIDUAL GAS ANALYZER. SOLUBLE SPECIES WILL BE MEASURED USING ION CHROMATOGRAPHY, DIRECT INFUSION TIME-OF-FLIGHT MASS SPECTROMETRY, SPECTROSCOPICALLY USING NMR, AND CHEMICALLY WITH VARIOUS ASSAYS. RELEVANCE TO EXOBIOLOGY PROGRAM. THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CONDITIONS SETTING STAGE FOR THE ORIGIN OF LIFE ON EARTH, THE RESOLUTION OF THE FYS ON THE EARLY EARTH/MARS AND HABITABILITY CONDITIONS ON TERRESTRIAL PLANETS AROUND YOUNG STARS. AS A SOURCE OF PREBIOTIC NITROGEN THIS WORK IS RELEVANT TO THE RESEARCH AREA OF  PREBIOTIC EVOLUTION . ABIOTIC NITROGEN FIXATION IS ONE OF THE  PLANETARY AND MOLECULAR PROCESSES THAT SET THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CONDITIONS WITHIN WHICH LIVING SYSTEMS MAY HAVE ARISEN  BY HELPING TO UNDERSTAND HOW PLANETARY NITROGEN BECAME AVAILABLE FOR USE IN THE ORIGIN AND EARLY EVOLUTION OF LIFE.

THE EARTH FORMED IN A WATER-POOR REGION OF THE PROTOPLANETARY DISK, AND EVEN TODAY THE BULK EARTH IS COSMICALLY DRY (POOR IN HYDROGEN, RELATIVE TO THE PROTOPLANETARY DISK). AT SOME 60 MA AFTER EARTH-ACCRETION, THE MOON-FORMING IMPACT PROBABLY REMOVED ANY WATER THAT MAY HAVE OUTGASSED AFTER CORE FORMATION, LEAVING THE HADEAN EARTH WATER-POOR AT ITS SURFACE. YET, EARLY ZIRCONS ARGUE THAT OCEANS EXISTED BY 250 MA AFTER FORMATION. SO, WAS WATER DELIVERED BY IMPACT DURING THE INTERVENING MILLENNIA, WHILE THE DECLINING HEAVY BOMBARDMENT WAS IN FULL SWING? WHAT ROLE DID PRIMITIVE BODIES PLAY IN DELIVERING WATER AND PRE-BIOTIC ORGANICS TO THE YOUNG EARTH? TOGETHER, THE INTERCOMPARISON OF COMETS (AND THEIR DYNAMICAL FAMILIES) WILL ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND WILL ALSO CLARIFY KEY QUESTIONS OF COMETARY ORIGINS. THE GODDARD COMET TEAM PIONEERED THE DIRECT STUDY OF PRIMARY VOLATILES IN COMETS AT INFRARED WAVELENGTHS, ESTABLISHING THE THEORETICAL BASIS FOR THIS APPROACH (MUMMA NASA CP-2223 1982, WEAVER AND MUMMA APJ 1984) AND DEMONSTRATING ITS FIRST SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION BY DETECTING H20 IN COMET IP/HALLEY IN 1985 (MUMMA ET AL. SCIENCE 1986). SINCE THEN, THE EVER-EXPANDING AND -EVOLVING GODDARD TEAM HAS PUBLISHED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED REFEREED PAPERS BASED ON AIRBORNE AND GROUND-BASED ASTRONOMICAL SPECTROSCOPY OF COMETS, EXTENDING THE APPROACH TO MANY MOLECULAR SPECIES INCLUDING ISOTOPOLOGUES. SINCE ITS INCEPTION, THIS IR APPROACH HAS BECOME A STANDARD FOR REMOTE SENSING OF PRIMARY VOLATILES IN COMETS, AND MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT GROUPS WORLDWIDE NOW APPLY IT. AUGMENTED BY RADIO INVESTIGATIONS, THE COMBINED APPROACHES NOW ADDRESS UP TO SEVERAL DOZEN MOLECULAR SPECIES IN A GIVEN COMET, PERMITTING ATTEMPTS TO DEFINE A TAXONOMY FOR COMETS BASED ON THEIR VOLATILE COMPOSITION, USING THE SO-QUANTIFIED ABUNDANCES OF PRIMARY COMA VOLATILES THAT WERE STORED INITIALLY IN THE ICY NUCLEUS. TODAY, THIS RESEARCH IS ACHIEVED THROUGH THE CURRENT GENERATION OF NEAR-INFRARED (A.#tilde# 1-5  M) LONG-SLIT ECHELLE GRATING SPECTROMETERS THAT INCORPORATE LARGE-FORMAT 2-D DETECTOR ARRAYS (2KX2K) WITH SUB-ARC-SECOND PIXEL SIZES. THEY COMBINE HIGH ANGULAR RESOLUTION (TYPICALLY :S 1 ARC-SECOND) WITH THE HIGH SPECTRAL RESOLVING POWER (A./8A. 2: 2.5X104 AND HIGHER) REQUIRED FOR ISOLATION OF INDIVIDUAL COMETARY EMISSION LINES. IN PARALLEL WITH THEIR FIRST-LINE USE OF DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED INSTRUMENTS, THE TEAM ALSO ACHIEVED MAJOR ADVANCES IN THEORY AND DATA PROCESSING. THESE WERE ENABLED BY THE ADVENT OF COMPREHENSIVE SPECTROSCOPIC DATABASES CONTAINING BILLIONS OF LINES, ROBUST RADIATIVE TRANSFER MODELS, AND UNPRECEDENTED COMPUTATIONAL POWER. THEY TRANSFORMED THE WAY WE INVESTIGATE COMETARY ATMOSPHERES. THE GOAL IS TO EXTRACT THE MAXIMUM SCIENCE FROM DATA RETURNED BY THESE INSTRUMENTS.

STELLAR ROTATION COUPLED WITH CONVECTIVE MOTIONS GIVE RISE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS. HIGH PRECISION SPECTROSCOPY AND PHOTOMETRY MEASUREMENTS HAVE DETECTED CYCLES IN THE MAGNETIC ACTIVITY OF STARS SIMILAR TO THE 11 YEAR SOLAR CYCLE. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DISCOVER CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT GOVERN STELLAR CYCLE DYNAMICS UTILIZING SPECTROSCOPY AND PHOTOMETRY MEASUREMENTS FROM SUN-LIKE STARS. IN PARTICULAR, OUR INVESTIGATION WILL RELATE BASIC OBSERVABLES, SUCH AS MASS, METALLICITY, RADIUS, ROTATION RATE, DEPTH OF CONVECTION ZONE, AND DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION RATES WITH TOTAL SOLAR IRRADIANCE AND STARSPOT PROPERTIES INCLUDING: TOTAL SPOTTEDNESS AND SWITCHING OF DOMINANT ACTIVITY BETWEEN LONGITUDES (FLIP-FLOP CYCLES). WE WILL FOCUS ON DETERMINING WHICH FACTORS CONTROL THE PERIODICITY OF STARSPOTS, HOW STELLAR CYCLES EVOLVE WITH THE AGE OF STARS, AND WHICH FACTORS DETERMINE DEEP GLOBAL MINIMA IN STELLAR CYCLE DYNAMICS. METHODOLOGY: WE WILL UTILIZE A SET OF INFORMATION-THEORETICAL TOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN RECENTLY DEVELOPED TO EXAMINE CAUSE AND EFFECT RELATIONSHIPS IN OBSERVATIONAL DATASETS. TRANSFER ENTROPY AND MUTUAL REDUNDANCY ARE ENTROPY-BASED MEASURES OF DEPENDENCY (E.G. MUTUAL INFORMATION) THAT ARE BASED ON CONDITIONAL PROBABILITIES AND CAN BE USED TO MEASURE THE DIRECTED INFORMATION TRANSFER BETWEEN TWO VARIABLES. THE CONDITIONAL REDUNDANCY WILL BE USED TO SYSTEMATICALLY ISOLATE CONTROLLING VARIABLES FROM A SET OF INPUT MEASUREMENTS. ONCE CAUSAL VARIABLES ARE IDENTIFIED, WE WILL CONSTRUCT COUPLING FUNCTIONS TO DESCRIBE THE DEPENDENCE OF STELLAR CYCLE DYNAMICS ON THE CAUSAL VARIABLES USING THE PRINCIPLE OF MAXIMIZATION OF INFORMATION. PROPOSED CONTRIBUTION TO THE FOCUS TEAM EFFORT AND RELEVANCE TO NASA: THIS INVESTIGATION WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE FOCUS TEAM EFFORT 3.1.2 \THE SOLAR-STELLAR CONNECTION.\"" THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUES WILL BE USED TO IDENTIFY PROCESSES (VARIABLES) THAT CONTROL TOTAL SOLAR IRRADIANCE AND STARSPOT CYCLES, INCLUDING PERIODICITY AND DEEP GLOBAL MINIMA, AND TO CONSTRUCT NONLINEAR MAPS THAT CAPTURE THE ACTIVITY CYCLE DYNAMICS AND HAVE PREDICTIVE VALUE. THE PROPOSED PROJECT RELIES HEAVILY ON COLLABORATIONS WITH OBSERVERS AND MODELERS ON THE LWS TEAM. OUR PLAN IS TO WORK WITH OBSERVERS ON THE TEAM TO COMPILE A DATABASE OF VARIABLES THAT CHARACTERIZE THE MAGNETIC ACTIVITY CYCLE DYNAMICS AND TO IDENTIFY CAUSAL VARIABLES THAT CONTROL THE DYNAMICS. WE WILL WORK WITH TEAM MODELERS TO EVALUATE THE OUTPUT FROM PREDICTIVE MODELS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ADEQUATELY CAPTURE THE SYSTEM DYNAMICS, AND WE WILL USE THE PRINCIPLE OF MAXIMIZATION OF INFORMATION TO CONSTRUCT PREDICTIVE MODELS FOR STARSPOT DYNAMICS. IDENTIFICATION OF OBSERVABLES AND MODEL PARAMETERS THAT CONTROL SOLAR CYCLE DYNAMICS WILL ALSO ADVANCE GOAL 1 FROM THE HELIOPHYSICS DECADAL SURVEY \""DETERMINE THE ORIGINS OF THE SUN''S ACTIVITY AND PREDICT THE VARIATIONS IN THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT.\""""",,,,

GIVEN THE HIGH LAUNCH COST AND SHIFT TOWARD SMALLER PAYLOADS, REDUCING THE SIZE, WEIGHT, AND POWER (SWAP) OF SPACE-BASED NAVIGATION SYSTEMS IS A CRITICAL NEED. ATOM-INTERFEROMETRIC INERTIAL SENSORS HAVE DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE OVER CONVENTIONAL INERTIAL DEVICES OWING TO THE INTRINSIC STABILITY OF ATOMIC SYSTEMS. CENTRAL TO MAKING COLD ATOM SENSORS PRACTICAL IS THEIR ABILITY TO RELIABLY OPERATE FOR EXTENDED PERIODS WITHOUT USER INTERVENTION. CURRENT LASER DIODES, WHICH ARE AT THE HEART OF ATOMIC SENSORS, SUFFER FROM POWER DEGRADATION AND MODE HOPS ON TIMESCALES INCOMPATIBLE WITH LONG TERM DEPLOYMENT. BECAUSE THESE PROPERTIES ARE INHERENT TO THE DIODES, IT IS PRUDENT TO CIRCUMVENT THESE PROBLEMS WITH DIAGNOSTIC PROTOCOLS AIMED AT EARLY DETECTION AND ACTION. DIODES CLOSE TO MODE HOPPING CAN BE TEMPORARILY TAKEN OFFLINE TO TUNE AWAY THE MODE HOP VIA CURRENT AND TEMPERATURE. DIODES WITH DEGRADED POWER CAN BE TAKEN OFFLINE ENTIRELY IN FAVOR OF A HEALTHY DIODE. THIS APPROACH WILL PROVIDE A ROBUST, WAVELENGTH-AGNOSTIC TECHNIQUE TO DELIVER RELIABLE, LONG-LIVED LASER SOURCES AT ATOM SENSOR-RELEVANT WAVELENGTHS. AOSENSE PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A COLD ATOM LASER MODULE (CALM) CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING A BROAD RANGE OF ATOMIC SENSORS. DEVELOPMENT OF THE CALM LASER MODULE WILL RESULT IN A RUGGEDIZED AND RELIABLE LASER SOURCE CAPABLE OF AUTONOMOUSLY DRIVING AN ATOM-BASED SENSOR WITHIN THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT.

IN PHASE I, WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE REQUISITE PERFORMANCE USING EXISTING HARDWARE COUPLED WITH OFF-THE-SHELF CONTROL ELECTRONICS. BASED ON OUR RESULTS, WE HAVE DESIGNED A FULLY-INTEGRATED MODULE CAPABLE OF DISSEMINATING TIMING SIGNALS WITH SUB-FEMTOSECOND ERROR FROM 1-10,000 S. IN PHASE II, WE WILL PACKAGE THE DEVICE AND DELIVER IT FOR EXTERNAL TESTING. OUR SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE GROUND-TO-SATELLITE SYNCHRONIZATION A MILLION-FOLD OVER CURRENT RF-BASED TIME TRANSFER SYSTEMS, ENABLING APPLICATIONS INCLUDING CLOCK-BASED GEODESY, VERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY, COHERENT LIDAR ARRAYS, AND TESTS OF GENERAL RELATIVITY. THE PHASE I BREADBOARD DEMONSTRATION PERFORMANCE IS CONSISTENT WITH A TIMING JITTER OF 3 FS @ 1S AND INTEGRATES DOWN TO 700 AS AT 30 SECONDS. THE CORRESPONDING FRACTIONAL TIMING INSTABILITY IS 3 X 10^-15 @ 1 SECOND, WHICH FLICKERS AT 2.7 X 10^-17 OUT TO 2000 SECONDS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE SYSTEMATIC EFFECTS THAT LIMIT BOTH SHORT AND LONG TERM STABILITY AND INCORPORATED THE IMPROVEMENTS INTO THE PHASE II DESIGN. WITH THESE IMPROVEMENTS, WE EXPECT A 10X IMPROVEMENT IN BOTH SHORT AND LONG TERMS STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM. IN ADDITION, WE REVIEWED AND FORMALIZED THE LASER DRIVER AND CONTROL ELECTRONICS SPECIFICATIONS. THE INITIAL SCHEMATIC CAPTURE FOR CRITICAL ANALOG SUB SECTIONS WAS COMPLETED AND A SUITABLE FPGA/MICROPROCESSOR COMBINATION WAS CHOSEN TO CONTROL THE SYSTEM AND PROCESS THE TIMING INFORMATION. BASED ON THESE DESIGNS, POWER AND SIZE ESTIMATES WERE USED TO COMPLETE THE MECHANICAL ENCLOSURE MODEL FOR THE TIME-TRANSFER SYSTEM. FOR MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY IN THE FINAL ARCHITECTURE OF THE OVERALL FREE-SPACE TIME TRANSFER SYSTEM, EACH FREQUENCY COMB SUB-UNIT THAT INCLUDES THE LASER AND CONTROL ELECTRONICS WILL BE HOUSED IN A 1U RACK MOUNT ENCLOSURE.",,,,

CARBON IS A KEY PREBIOTIC ELEMENT AND A MAJOR COMPONENT IN PROTOPLANETARY MATERIALS. THUS, UNDERSTANDING THE EVOLUTION OF CARBON WILL HELP CONSTRAIN THE ASTROCHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT OF TERRESTRIAL PLANET FORMATION AND THE PRODUCTION OF PREBIOTIC COMPOUNDS IN THE EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM. THE SOLAR SYSTEM 12C/13C RATIO IS #tilde# 87, WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE 12C/13C OF THE SURROUNDING INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM (#tilde# 69). FURTHER, HIGH-RESOLUTION ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS TOWARD LOW-MASS YOUNG STELLAR OBJECTS (YSOS) HAVE REVEALED UNEXPECTED HETEROGENEITY IN GAS-PHASE [12C16O[/[13C16O] (HERETOFORE, 12CO/13CO), SUGGESTING THAT COMPLEX CHEMISTRY MAY BE AFFECTING PROTOPLANETARY CARBON RATHER THAN SUGGESTED DIRECT INHERITANCE FROM THE PARENT CLOUD. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO EXPLAIN ISOTOPIC OBSERVATIONS TOWARD YSOS, AND ACHIEVE A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERLYING CHEMISTRY AFFECTING EARLY CARBON RESERVOIRS IN THE SOLAR NEBULA THROUGH THE FOLLOWING: (1) OBSERVATIONS -WE WILL ANALYZE HIGH-RESOLUTION CO DATA OF BRIGHT YSOS ALONG A GALACTIC GRADIENT, OBSERVED WITH THE KECK TELESCOPE, AND INFORMED BY ARCHIVED KECK AND CRIRES DATA. RATIOS OF [12CO]/[13CO] DERIVED FROM THE DATA WILL BE INTERPRETED IN THE CONTEXT OF 12C/13C FROM OTHER CARBON-BASED RESERVOIRS (I.E., CO AND CO2 ICE) THAT ARE ALONG THE SAME LINE-OF-SIGHT, THEREBY ENABLING A DIRECT INVESTIGATION OF CARBON INHERITANCE IN EACH PROTOPLANETARY SYSTEM; (2) EXPERIMENTS - WE WILL PERFORM INTERSTELLAR ICE EXPERIMENTS TO EXPLORE CARBON FRACTIONATION PATHWAYS BETWEEN CO AND CO2 MOLECULAR RESERVOIRS, FURTHER AIDING IN THE INTERPRETATION OF ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS; AND (3) MODELS - WE WILL CREATE THEORETICAL MODELS TO HELP PARAMETERIZE OBSERVED ISOTOPE RATIOS AND FURTHER DEFINE THE CHEMICAL PATHWAYS ALONG EACH LINE-OF-SIGHT, TRACKING CHANGES IN THE CARBON-CONTAINING GAS AND ICE. OUR GOAL IS TO ADD SIGNIFICANTLY TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF CARBON EVOLUTION IN THE EARLY SOLAR NEBULA, AND HELP PUT THE SOLAR SYSTEM INTO A MEANINGFUL CONTEXT WITH RESPECT TO OTHER PROTOPLANETARY SYSTEMS. METHODOLOGY: HIGH-RESOLUTION ROVIBRATIONAL SPECTRA FROM NIRSPEC ON THE KECK TELESCOPE WILL BE USED TO DERIVE PRECISE ABUNDANCES FOR CO ISOTOPOLOGUES, INCLUDING 12C18O AND 12C17O, WHICH HELP CONSTRAIN THE ANALYSIS. OBSERVATIONS OF MASSIVE YSOS WILL BE LED BY THE PI AND COLLABORATOR BLAKE, AND OUR CUSTOMIZED CODES WILL BE USED FOR DATA REDUCTION AND ANALYSIS OF NEW AND ARCHIVAL DATA. A SET OF NEW DATA WILL BE OBTAINED TO FILL IN MISSING REGIONS OF THE GALACTIC GRADIENT. ARCHIVAL DATA FROM THE CRIRES AND KECK ARCHIVES WILL BE USED TO HELP CONSTRAIN 13CO ABUNDANCES, WHICH ARE USEFUL FOR INPUT INTO THE MODELS. CO-I GUDIPATI WILL LEAD THE EXPERIMENTS AT HIS JPL LAB, WHICH IS EQUIPPED TO EXPLORE MOLECULAR RESERVOIRS AND POTENTIAL FRACTIONATION MECHANISMS BETWEEN ISOTOPOLOGUES OF CO AND CO2 IN ICE AND GAS PHASES UNDER RELEVANT INTERSTELLAR CONDITIONS. THE CO MODELS LED BY CO-I WILLACY WILL TRACK GAS AND ICE ISOTOPE CHEMISTRY IN A RANGE OF SYSTEMS AIMED AT EXPLORING CO ICE- AND GAS-RESERVOIRS, USING APPROPRIATE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS. THE MODELS WILL DERIVE MOLECULAR ISOTOPE RATIOS ACROSS TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS IDENTIFIED FROM THE SPECTRAL ANALYSES. THE ENTIRE PROPOSAL TEAM WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE SCIENCE, AND THE PI WILL RECRUIT 3 STUDENTS/YEAR TO PARTICIPATE IN DEFINED ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT. RELEVANCE: THIS PROJECT IS RELEVANT TO MANY ASPECTS OF THE EMERGING WORLDS (EW) SCOPE, INCLUDING INVESTIGATIONS OF  PROCESSES THAT RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO THE CHEMICAL NATURE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM,   AND ADDRESSES THE RELEVANT TOPICS OF PROTOPLANETARY DISK FORMATION AND EVOLUTION (VIA UNDERSTANDING THEIR PRIMORDIAL CORE PHASES), LARGE-SCALE ISOTOPIC FRACTIONATION PROCESSES, AND CHEMICAL PROCESSING OF GAS AND ICE.

THE ALGORITHMS FUSE THE ACQUIRED MASTCAM STEREO IMAGES AT DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS TO GENERATE MULTISPECTRAL IMAGE CUBES, WHICH CAN THEN BE USED FOR HIGH QUALITY VIRTUAL REALITY (IMMERSIVE) VISUALIZATION IN 3D, DATA CLUSTERING, ANOMALY DETECTION, AND ROUGH COMPOSITION ESTIMATION FROM RELATIVELY LONG DISTANCE WHEN COMPARED TO LIBS INSTRUMENT. ONE MAJOR CHALLENGE IN CONSTRUCTING A MULTISPECTRAL IMAGE CUBE FROM THE TWO MASTCAMS IS THE ALIGNMENT OF THE IMAGES IN THE STEREO IMAGE PAIR WHICH NEEDS TO HAVE REGISTRATION ERRORS IN THE SUBPIXEL LEVEL. TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGE IN THE STEREO IMAGE ALIGNMENT, WE PROPOSE A TWO-STEP IMAGE REGISTRATION FRAMEWORK. IN THIS FRAMEWORK, WE ALSO PROVIDE A SET OF IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING PANSHARPENING, DEBAYERING, DATA CLUSTERING, AND ANOMALY DETECTION. IN PHASE II, WE WILL FURTHER VALIDATE THE ABOVE ALGORITHMS USING MASTCAM-Z DATA.

THE CURRENT WORK IS DIRECTED TO CAPTURING THE SAME OR COMPARABLE LEVELS OF REFLECTANCE, WITH SCCNT COATING WHICH CAN BE APPLIED AT ROOM TEMPERATURE USING CONVENTIONAL SPRAY-UP METHOD ONTO FLAT AND CURVED OBJECTS.

GIANT IMPACTS GENERATE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF BOUND AND ESCAPING DEBRIS; HOWEVER, CURRENT PARAMETERIZED HYDRODYNAMIC STUDIES ONLY DESCRIBE THE LARGEST ONE OR TWO REMNANTS IN MINIMAL DETAIL. THESE STUDIES ALSO LACK KEY ANGLE, SIZE-SCALE, AND COMPOSITION DEPENDENCE OF GIANT IMPACT OUTCOMES NECESSARY FOR INFORMING CUTTING-EDGE N-BODY PLANETARY EVOLUTION MODELS. DUE TO THESE DEFICIENCIES, CURRENT N-BODY CODES LACK THE ABILITY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ORBITAL DAMPING OF TERRESTRIAL PLANETS AND THE MIXING OF MATERIAL BETWEEN PLANETARY BODIES. THE NATURE OF GIANT IMPACT DEBRIS IS PARAMOUNT IN UNDERSTANDING THE GENESIS OF SMALL BODY POPULATIONS, SATELLITE SYSTEMS, AND RE-IMPACTING BOLIDES. FOR EXAMPLE, EVIDENCE OF DEBRIS FROM THE MOON-FORMING GIANT IMPACT WAS FOUND IN THE MAIN-BELT ASTEROID POPULATION. COLLISIONS WILL NOT ONLY PREFERENTIALLY EXCAVATE ICY OR ROCKY MANTLE MATERIAL, BUT ESCAPING DEBRIS ON HELIOCENTRIC ORBITS WILL SERVE AS A HEAT SOURCE IN THE FORM OF RE-IMPACTING BOLIDES FOR TENS, IF NOT, HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS.

THIS  GREAT OXIDATION EVENT  (GOE), WHICH WAS WELL UNDERWAY BY ABOUT 2.3 BILLION YEARS AGO, MADE LIFE LIKE US - AEROBIC LIFE - POSSIBLE. TO ELUCIDATE THE TIMING AND MECHANISM OF THIS CHANGE, WE NEED TO QUANTIFY SOURCES AND SINKS OF O2 (HOLLAND 2002; KASTING 2013; CATLING 2013). THE IMPORTANCE OF OXIDATIVE WEATHERING AS AN O2 SINK HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT TO CONSTRAIN. RECENT MODELS OF THE GOE INVOKE CHANGES IN CONTINENTAL CRUST COMPOSITION, AND THUS CHANGES IN THE CAPACITY OF OXIDATIVE WEATHERING TO CONSUME O2, TO EXPLAIN THE TIMING OF ATMOSPHERE OXYGENATION (E.G., LEE ET AL. 2016). HOWEVER, THESE MODELS ARE CONTENTIOUS AND POORLY CONSTRAINED BECAUSE THE RATES OF OXIDATIVE WEATHERING AT PRE-GOE LEVELS OF O2 ARE EXTRAPOLATED FROM EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED AT MUCH HIGHER PO2 (REINHARD ET AL. 2009; REINHARD ET AL. 2013). IMPROVING THESE MODELS REQUIRES HIGH-QUALITY EMPIRICAL DATA CONSTRAINING THE OXIDATION KINETICS OF CRUSTAL MATERIALS (ROCKS, SEDIMENTS, SOILS) CONDUCTED IN THE PO2 RANGE RELEVANT FOR ARCHEAN WEATHERING. HERE, I PROPOSE TO CONDUCT ULTRA-LOW PO2 EXPERIMENTS TO STUDY THE OXIDATION KINETICS OF MAJOR REDUCED SINKS SUCH AS BASALTS, KOMATIITES, AND ORGANIC-RICH BLACK SHALES AT PRE-GOE PO2. THIS WORK WILL BUILD ON EXPERIMENTS I HAVE ALREADY DONE WITH SULFIDES, AND WILL TELL US MORE ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE CONTINENTAL CRUST IN PROMPTING OR DELAYING THE GOE. TO DO THIS, I WILL USE RECENTLY DEVELOPED  LUMINESCENCE MEASURING OPTODE SENSOR  (LUMOS) TO MEASURE CONCENTRATIONS OF DISSOLVED OXYGEN DOWN TO SINGLE DIGIT NANOMOLAR CONCENTRATIONS (LEHNER ET AL. 2014). THESE LEVELS OF OXYGEN ARE UP TO THREE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE LOWER THAN THE LIMITS OF DETECTION ON PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED TECHNIQUES, AND BEGIN TO APPROACH THE LEVELS OF O2 CONSISTENT WITH AN ARCHEAN ATMOSPHERE (10-5 PRESENT ATMOSPHERIC LEVEL (PAL)   1 NM). USING A  CHEMOSTAT  DESIGN, I WILL CONDUCT OXIDATION EXPERIMENTS WITH LUMOS TO MEASURE KINETIC OXIDATION OF ARCHEAN SHALES, KOMATIITES, AND GRANITOIDS, AS WELL AS BASALTS OF VARIOUS COMPOSITIONS TO BEST APPROXIMATE THE ARCHEAN CONTINENTAL CRUST. THESE OXIDATION RATES WILL TELL US HOW EFFICIENTLY THE ARCHEAN CRUST MAY HAVE CONSUMED O2 PRIOR TO THE GOE, AND THUS PROVIDE CONSTRAINTS ON THE ROLE OF OXIDATIVE WEATHERING DURING THE OXYGENATION OF EARTH S ATMOSPHERE. GIVEN NASA S PLANETARY SCIENCE GOALS, THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS WELL-SUITED TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF LIFE ON EARTH TO GUIDE OUR SEARCH FOR LIFE ELSEWHERE. IN PARTICULAR, IT ADDRESSES THE FOLLOWING PLANETARY RESEARCH PROGRAM INVESTIGATION TOPICS: INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE ORIGINS, EVOLUTION, AND PROPERTIES OF THE ATMOSPHERES OF PLANETARY BODIES (INCLUDING SATELLITES, SMALL BODIES, AND EXOPLANETS), AND INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE ORIGIN AND EARLY EVOLUTION OF LIFE, THE POTENTIAL OF LIFE TO ADAPT TO DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS, AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR LIFE ELSEWHERE. THE WORK ADDRESSES THESE TOPICS BY TELLING US FOUR NEW THINGS: 1) IT WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND THE ROLES OF TECTONICS AND CRUSTAL COMPOSITION IN THE OXYGENATION OF PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES, 2) IT WILL INFORM OUR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT HOW COMMON O2 ATMOSPHERES MIGHT BE ON EARTH-LIKE EXOPLANETS, 3) IT WILL TEACH US ABOUT THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN BIOLOGICAL AND PLANETARY EVOLUTION IN SHAPING THE COMPOSITION OF PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES, AND 4) IT WILL GIVE US CONSTRAINTS ON THE AMBIENT PO2 AND OTHER CONDITIONS THAT WERE MET (IF NOT REQUIRED) BEFORE THE EVOLUTION OF EUKARYOTES AND LIFE LIKE US.",,,,

ALTHOUGH THE MASS GAIN FROM ICE SHEETS WILL DOMINATE A CENTURY FROM NOW, AT THE MOMENT DYNAMICAL ADJUSTMENTS OF THE OCEAN TO VARIABLE WINDS AS WELL AS THE CONTRIBUTION OF VERTICAL LAND MOTION (VLM) CAUSE MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT DEVIATIONS OF REGIONAL RELATIVE SEA LEVEL AWAY FROM THE GLOBAL MEAN. IT HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN SEVERAL REGIONS THAT THESE DYNAMICAL CHANGES IN MEAN SEA LEVEL EXCEED GLOBAL MEAN SEA LEVEL RISE BY A FACTOR OF THREE TO FOUR TIMES FOR PERIODS OF TWENTY YEARS OR LONGER. ONE EXAMPLE IS IN THE WESTERN PACIFIC, AND STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THIS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PACIFIC DECADAL OSCILLATION (PDO). WITH GROWING EVIDENCE FOR A CHANGE IN THE STATE OF THE PDO, THE WEST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES MAY BE IN STORE FOR RAPIDLY RISING SEA LEVEL OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY YEARS, OR LONGER. IT IS IMPORTANT TO QUANTIFY THE POSSIBLE SIZE. WE PROPOSE TO STUDY BOTH THE DYNAMICAL OCEAN SIGNAL, AND THE VERTICAL LAND MOTION IN COMBINATION, AS IT IS RELATIVE SEA LEVEL CHANGE THAT IS MOST IMPORTANT TO SOCIETY. VERTICAL LAND MOTION INCLUDES ONGOING GLACIAL ISOSTATIC ADJUSTMENT (FOR WHICH SEVERAL MODELS ARE AVAILABLE), SEDIMENT COMPACTION, TECTONIC SIGNALS AS WELL AS ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES DUE TO GROUNDWATER AND OIL EXTRACTION, AND POPULATION GROWTH. THE VLM HAS BEEN LITTLE STUDIED IN TERMS OF THE EFFECT ON REGIONAL SEA LEVEL. THUS, WE WILL EVALUATE IT ALONG THE ENTIRE PACIFIC, GULF, AND ATLANTIC COAST OF NORTH AMERICA USING GPS AND INSAR, WITH A FOCUS ON LARGE AND IMPORTANT COASTAL CITIES: SAN FRANCISCO, LOS ANGELES, SEATTLE, NEW YORK CITY, HOUSTON/GALVESTON, AND MIAMI. THE METHODS WE WILL USE ARE BRIEFLY SUMMARIZED BELOW: 1. WE WILL IDENTIFY THE RELEVANT MECHANISMS FORCING DECADAL- TO MULTI-DECADAL VARIATIONS IN REGIONAL MEAN SEA LEVEL AT SELECT LOCATIONS AROUND THE UNITED STATES BASED ON ANALYSIS OF TIDE GAUGE RECORDS AND A REGIONAL OCEAN MODEL NESTED WITHIN A GLOBAL GENERAL CIRCULATION MODEL. WE WILL QUANTIFY HOW WELL THE REGIONAL MODEL SEA SURFACE HEIGHT (AND/OR BOTTOM PRESSURE) MATCHES THE OBSERVED RECORD FROM TIDE GAUGES, QUANTIFY HOW THE VARIATIONS ARE RELATED TO LARGER-SCALE CLIMATE MODES (E.G., PDO, EL NI O, NORTH ATLANTIC OSCILLATION, ATLANTIC MUTIDECADAL VARIABILITY, ETC), AND ADJUST THE REGIONAL MODEL TO BETTER MATCH BOTH THE MAGNITUDE AND TIMING OF OBSERVED SEA LEVEL EVENTS. THIS WILL BE DONE VIA A COMBINATION OF REGIONAL SCALING, ADJUSTING FORCING PARAMETERS, AND/OR ADJUSTING SELECT PARAMETERS IN THE MODEL. ONCE THE REGIONAL MODEL IS VALIDATED, WE WILL USE PAST WIND RECORDS REPRESENTING PAST STATES OF THE CLIMATE SYSTEM (I.E., PDO WIND VARIABILITY FROM THE 1950S-1970S, ENSO WIND VARIABILITY FROM THE 1980S-1990S), AND FORCE THE MODEL TO MAKE PREDICTIONS OF POSSIBLE SEA LEVEL EXCURSIONS FOR THE NEXT TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS. 2. WE WILL UTILIZE GPS AND INSAR TO DETERMINE VERTICAL DISPLACEMENTS IN THE COASTAL REGIONS OF THE AFOREMENTIONED CITIES. INSAR PROVIDES DETAILED, COMPREHENSIVE BUT LOCALIZED OBSERVATIONS OF DISPLACEMENT IN THE SATELLITE LINE OF SIGHT AT PIXELS A FEW METERS APART.

THE STELLAR ULTRAVIOLET (UV) RADIATION FROM M DWARFS IS STRONG AND HIGHLY VARIABLE, AND IMPACTS PLANETARY ATMOSPHERIC LOSS, COMPOSITION AND HABITABILITY. THESE EFFECTS ARE AMPLIFIED BY THE EXTREME PROXIMITY OF THEIR HZS (0.1 0.4 AU). JWST WILL CHARACTERIZE HZ M DWARF PLANETS AND ATTEMPT THE FIRST SPECTROSCOPIC SEARCH FOR LIFE BEYOND THE SOLAR SYSTEM. KNOWING THE UV ENVIRONMENTS OF M DWARF PLANETS WILL BE CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTANDING THEIR ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION AND A KEY PARAMETER IN DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN BIOLOGICAL AND ABIOTIC SOURCES FOR OBSERVED BIOSIGNATURES. THE UV FLUX EMITTED DURING THE SUPER-LUMINOUS PREMAIN SEQUENCE PHASE OF M STARS DRIVES WATER LOSS AND PHOTOCHEMICAL O2 BUILDUP FOR TERRESTRIAL PLANETS WITHIN THE HZ. THIS PHASE CAN PERSIST FOR UP TO A BILLION YEARS FOR THE LOWEST MASS M STARS. AFTERWARDS, UV-DRIVEN PHOTOCHEMISTRY DURING THE MAIN SEQUENCE PHASE STRONGLY AFFECTS A PLANET S ATMOSPHERE, COULD LIMIT THE PLANET S POTENTIAL FOR HABITABILITY, AND MAY CONFUSE STUDIES OF HABITABILITY BY CREATING FALSE CHEMICAL BIOSIGNATURES.

FOR EACH TARGET, SPARCS WILL OBSERVE CONTINUOUSLY BETWEEN ONE AND THREE COMPLETE STELLAR ROTATIONS (4 45 DAYS) OVER A MISSION LIFETIME OF 2 YEARS. A UV CHARACTERIZATION SURVEY OF M DWARFS, THE MOST COMMON OF PLANET HOSTS, IS A PERFECT EXPERIMENT FOR A CUBESAT: -- UV ASTRONOMY CANNOT BE DONE FROM THE GROUND BECAUSE OF EARTH S ATMOSPHERIC ABSORPTION. -- PHOTOMETRY OF NEARBY SOURCES IS AN EFFICIENT USE OF A SMALL APERTURE. -- UNLIKE THE HST, WHOSE TIME IS SHARED AMONG MANY INSTRUMENTS AND PROGRAMS, A CUBESAT CAN PROVIDE DEDICATED SPACE-BASED LONG-TERM MONITORING IN THE UV. TECHNOLOGY: SPARCS WILL ADVANCE UV DETECTOR TECHNOLOGY BY FLYING HIGH QUANTUM EFFICIENCY (QE), UV-OPTIMIZED DETECTORS DEVELOPED AT JPL. THESE  DELTA-DOPED  DETECTORS HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF DEPLOYMENT DEMONSTRATING GREATER THAN 5X THE SENSITIVITY OF THE DETECTORS USED BY GALEX. SPARCS WILL PAVE THE WAY FOR THEIR APPLICATION IN MISSIONS LIKE LUVOIR OR HABEX. EDUCATION: THE SPARCS RESEARCH PROGRAM WILL TRAIN FUTURE SCIENTISTS AND MISSION LEADERS BY MENTORING FIVE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS, THREE GRADUATE STUDENTS, AND TWO POST-DOCTORAL SCHOLARS THROUGHOUT ALL ASPECTS OF THE MISSION, INCLUDING ENGINEERING, SCIENCE, DATA MANAGEMENT AND OUTREACH. RELEVANCE TO NASA: THE SPARCS MISSION WILL ADDRESS NASA S GOALS OF IDENTIFYING THE CHARACTERISTICS AND DISTRIBUTION OF POTENTIALLY HABITABLE ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING HZ PLANET HOSTS LIKE PROXIMA AND TRAPPIST-1. SPARCS WILL ALSO BE CAPABLE OF  TARGETOF- OPPORTUNITY  UV OBSERVATIONS OF NASA S TESS YIELD OF ROCKY PLANETS IN M DWARF HZS, SOME OF THE FIRST HZ PLANETS TO BE SPECTROSCOPICALLY CHARACTERIZED BY JWST.

WE PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED AN ADVANCED THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3-D) MODEL OF HUMAN COLON CONTAINING INFLAMMATORY IMMUNE CELLS AND APPLIED IT TO STUDY HOST-PATHOGEN INTERACTIONS, INCLUDING THE INFLUENCE OF LOW FLUID SHEAR MICROGRAVITY ANALOGUE CULTURE ON THE ABILITY OF THE ENTERIC PATHOGEN SALMONELLA TO COLONIZE THE HOST. THIS SAME MODEL WAS ALSO APPLIED TO STUDY HOSTMICROBIOTA INTERACTIONS USING PATIENT-DERIVED FECAL CONSORTIA FROM BOTH HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS AND THOSE SUFFERING FROM A GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDER.

THESE MOLTEN SALTS OFFER SEVERAL BENEFICIAL ATTRIBUTES, INCLUDING FIXED CHARGE, TUNABLE MOLECULAR STRUCTURES (I.E., DESIGNER SOLVENTS/AGENTS), NEGLIGIBLE VOLATILITY, AND RELATIVELY HIGH THERMAL STABILITY. THE HYDROPHILICITY, DIELECTRIC CONSTANT, AND MANY OTHER ATTRIBUTES CAN BE ALTERED BY TUNING THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE (BOTH CATION AND ANION CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY VARIED), YIELDING TASK-SPECIFIC IONIC LIQUIDS FOR THE MANY APPLICATIONS NOTED ABOVE. THE INCORPORATION OF ILS INTO VARIOUS MEMBRANE PROCESSES HAS BEEN GAINING ATTENTION OVER THE PAST DECADE. THESE SUPPORTED IONIC LIQUID MEMBRANES (SILMS) HAVE BEEN USED FOR SELECTIVE CO2 CAPTURE, THOUGH PRIMARILY SELECTIVE AGAINST CH4 OR N2. ADDITIONALLY, COMMON CONCERNS FOR THEIR COMMERCIAL OR INDUSTRIAL IMPLEMENTATION INCLUDE 1) IL BLOW-OUT, WHEN THE PRESSURE DROP ACROSS THE MEMBRANE CAUSES THE IL TO LEAVE THE POLYMERIC SUPPORT AND 2) THICK MEMBRANES, WHICH LIMITS TRANSPORT. THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON DESIGNING NEW SUPPORT MATERIALS, PROCESSING THEM INTO LARGE SURFACE AREA CO2 CAPTURE MEDIA, AND ENGINEERING THEIR PERFORMANCE TO IMPROVE THE CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART.

THE MEMBRANE CHARACTERISTICS WILL BE CHARACTERIZED WITH DYNAMIC MECHANICAL ANALYSIS, ELECTROCHEMICAL IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY, ATOMIC FORCE AND SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY, SIZE EXCLUSION CHROMATOGRAPHY AND POSITRON ANNIHILATION LIFETIME SPECTROSCOPY. STRUCTURE-PROPERTY RELATIONSHIPS WILL BE ESTABLISHED, IN PARTICULAR RELATED TO SURFACE ROUGHNESS AND MEMBRANE FREE VOLUME, TO THE CO2 CAPTURE. THE MEMBRANES WILL THEN BE PROCESSED USING VARIOUS SOLUTION CASTING TECHNIQUES TO STUDY MEMBRANE POROSITY AND THE IMPACT ON IL LOADING, CO2 CAPTURE AND TRANSPORT, AND MEMBRANE STABILITY. THE IL [1-BUTYL-3-METHYLIMIDAZOLIUM][BIS(TRIFLUOROMETHYLSULFONYL)IMIDE] WILL BE IMPREGNATED INTO THE MEMBRANE, BASED ON ITS DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO SELECTIVELY DISSOLVE CO2. THE CO2 PERM-SELECTIVITY AND TRANSPORT PROPERTIES (TEMPERATURE- AND PRESSURE-DEPENDENT FLUX) WILL BE CHARACTERIZED AND THE SYSTEM WILL BE OPTIMIZED. FINALLY, THE PROTOTYPE DESIGN WILL BE ASSEMBLED IN A WAY THAT ENABLE EASE OF INSTALLATION AND OPERATION, A HIGH CO2 SCRUBBING CAPACITY WITH LIMITED POWER CONSUMPTION, AND INTEGRATION WITH FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES (E.G., CATALYTIC FORMATION OF CH4 OR OTHER CARBON-BASED MATERIALS OF INTEREST).""",,,,

ANOXYGENIC PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN PARTICULAR IS IMPORTANT FOR THE EARLY ANOXIC EARTH AND FOR EXOPLANETS, WHERE ANOXIA MIGHT BE QUITE COMMON. IF THE EVOLUTION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS VIA A FEW \'RELATIVELY EASY\' STEPS IS POSSIBLE, WE MIGHT EXPECT TO FIND MANY WORLDS WITH PHOTOSYNTHETIC LIFE, WHETHER OR NOT OXYGENIC PHOTOSYNTHESIS EVER EMERGED. OTHERWISE, WE MIGHT EXPECT PHOTOSYNTHESIS TO BE RARE IN THE UNIVERSE. WE PROPOSE THAT A PLAUSIBLE EVOLUTIONARY INTERMEDIATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF (ANOXYGENIC) PHOTOSYNTHESIS WAS A CHEMOLITHOTROPHIC BACTERIUM THAT EXTRACTED ENERGY FROM ENVIRONMENTAL REDOX GRADIENTS. ONE WAY TO EXTRACT MORE ENERGY FROM A REDOX GRADIENT IS TO INSERT A PHOTOSYNTHETIC REACTION CENTER (RC) INTO THE ELECTRON TRANSPORT PATHWAY. THIS GIVES A CHEMOLITHOTROPH A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, ALLOWING IT TO USE LESS-REDUCING DONORS AND/OR LESS-OXIDIZING ACCEPTORS. A SHALLOW GRADIENT   OR EVEN AN UPHILL ELECTRON TRANSFER   COULD BE PROFITABLE TO AN ORGANISM USING LIGHT TO GENERATE A STEEPER GRADIENT, THUS PUMPING MORE PROTONS PER ELECTRON TRANSPORTED, AND MAKING MORE ATP. IN THIS VIEW, THE REACTION CENTER ALLOWS THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIGHT-ASSISTED LITHOTROPHY, I.E., PHOTO/ CHEMOLITHOTROPHY. OBJECTIVES: THERE ARE NO KNOWN EXAMPLES OF THE PHOTO/CHEMOLITHOTROPH WE INVOKE IN THIS EVOLUTIONARY TRAJECTORY. WE PROPOSE TO TEST THIS IDEA BY CREATING SUCH ORGANISMS. WE WILL USE THE PRIMITIVE PHOTOTROPH, HELIOBACTERIUM MODESTICALDUM, AS OUR STARTING POINT, BECAUSE IT IS EXPERIMENTALLY MUCH EASIER TO TRANSFER A FEW GENES REQUIRED TO CONFER LITHOTROPHY RATHER THAN THE MANY GENES REQUIRED FOR PHOTOTROPHY. WE HAVE DEVELOPED GENETIC TOOLS TO EDIT THE H. MODESTICALDUM CHROMOSOME USING ITS ENDOGENOUS DNA MODIFICATION SYSTEMS; THIS ALLOWS US TO REMOVE AND ADD GENES AT WILL. WE PROPOSE TO BREAK THE EXISTING CYCLIC ELECTRON FLOW PATHWAY BY REMOVING A SPECIFIC ENZYME (NADH DEHYDROGENASE) AND ADDING A SULFIDE:QUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE (SQR) TO ALLOW IT OXIDIZE SULFIDE TO SULFUR. THE ORGANISM CAN ALREADY REDUCE PROTONS TO MOLECULAR HYDROGEN (H2). THEREFORE, IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO OXIDIZE (EXTERNAL) SULFIDE AND REDUCE (INTERNAL) PROTONS, AIDED BY LIGHT, AND IN THE PROCESS CREATE A PROTON ELECTROCHEMICAL GRADIENT FOR ATP SYNTHESIS   THUS, EXTRACTING ENERGY FROM A REDOX GRADIENT THAT IS ENERGETICALLY UNFAVORABLE. WE WILL TEST THE GROWTH OF THE ENGINEERED ORGANISMS UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS AND QUANTIFY THEIR ABILITY TO (1) USE SULFIDE (S-2) AS ELECTRON DONOR, (2) REDUCE PROTONS TO H2, (3) EXTRACT ENERGY IN THE PROCESS, AND (4) FIX CO2. WE WILL ALSO TEST THE IDEA THAT AUTOTROPHY CAN BE CONFERRED BY ADDING ATP-CITRATE LYASE, WHICH IS THE ONLY ENZYME MISSING FROM THE REVERSE TCA CYCLE IN H. MODESTICALDUM. WE CAN MAKE SEVERAL COMBINATIONS OF THESE GENETIC MODIFICATIONS IN ORDER TO CONSTRUCT MULTIPLE POSSIBLE EVOLUTIONARY INTERMEDIATES. LASTLY, WE WILL ASSESS THE ISOTOPE SIGNATURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW SULFIDE OXIDATION, PROTON REDUCTION, AND CO2 FIXATION PATHWAYS AND COMPARE THEM WITH KNOWN METABOLIC FRACTIONATIONS AND WITH THE GEOLOGIC RECORDS. SIGNIFICANCE: THIS WORK IS RELEVANT FOR NASA EXOBIOLOGY BECAUSE IT DIRECTLY INVESTIGATES TWO RESEARCH TOPICS IN THE 2015 ASTROBIOLOGY STRATEGY: EARLY LIFE AND INCREASING COMPLEXITY AND CO-EVOLUTION OF LIFE AND THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL EXPERIMENTALLY EXPLORE THE ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF A KEY METABOLIC STRATEGY, ANOXYGENIC PHOTOTROPHY, IN THE CONTEXT OF ENVIRONMENTAL REDOX GRADIENTS. OUR RESULTS WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE POTENTIAL BIOSIGNATURES OF THE METABOLIC STRATEGIES WE EXPLORE IN THE ENGINEERED H. MODESTICALDUM STRAINS. THE RESULTS WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR UNDERSTANDING THE EVOLUTION OF LIFE ON THE EARLY EARTH AND FOR THE DIVERSITY OF BIOSIGNATURES THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM NOVEL METABOLISMS.",,,,

ALTHOUGH MANY STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE MAJOR OXYGEN PULSES THAT BOOKEND THE PROTEROZOIC EON, FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS PERSIST ABOUT GLOBAL REDOX DURING THE MIDDLE CHAPTERS OF EARTH HISTORY. THIS IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE THIS MID- PROTEROZOIC INTERVAL (#tilde#1.8 TO 0.8 BILLION YEARS AGO) WAS CHARACTERIZED BY A MAJOR DIVERSIFICATION OF EARLY EUKARYOTES THAT SET THE STAGE FOR SUBSEQUENT ANIMAL EVOLUTION. EXISTING CONSTRAINTS ON ATMOSPHERIC PO2 RANGE MORE THAN TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE, HINDERING OUR ABILITY TO DECIPHER THE ROLE THAT OXYGEN PLAYED IN DRIVING KEY MILESTONES IN EUKARYOTIC EVOLUTION. URANIUM (U) ISOTOPES CAN POTENTIALLY PROVIDE CRITICAL NEW CONSTRAINTS BECAUSE THE U ISOTOPE COMPOSITION OF SEAWATER WHICH CAN BE RECORDED IN MARINE CARBONATES IS CONTROLLED BY THE GLOBAL EXTENT OF SEAFLOOR ANOXIA. DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF THE U ISOTOPE PROXY IN CARBONATES WAS THE SUBJECT OF PRIOR SUPPORT TO OUR GROUP FROM NASA EXOBIOLOGY, AND THE CURRENT PROPOSAL IS A LOGICAL EXTENSION OF THE PIONEERING WORK THAT RESULTED FROM THAT SUPPORT. OVER THE PAST YEAR, OUR TEAM HAS AMASSED A LARGE U ISOTOPE DATASET FOR CARBONATES OF MID-PROTEROZOIC AGE. SURPRISINGLY, U ISOTOPE VALUES (−0.40   0.28   [1?]) ARE SIMILAR TO MODERN SEAWATER, SUGGESTING THAT LARGE PORTIONS OF THE MID-PROTEROZOIC OCEANS MIGHT HAVE BEEN OXYGENATED. HOWEVER, THERE ARE STILL MAJOR GAPS IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE U ISOTOPE SYSTEM THAT PRECLUDE DEFINITIVE INTERPRETATION. U ISOTOPE VALUES IN THIS RANGE COULD ALSO BE CONSISTENT WITH A LARGELY SUBOXIC OR ANOXIC, IRON-RICH (FERRUGINOUS) OCEAN. UNFORTUNATELY, EXISTING CONSTRAINTS ON U ISOTOPE BEHAVIOR UNDER SUBOXIC AND FERRUGINOUS CONDITIONS ARE LIMITED TO JUST A FEW DATA POINTS. HERE, WE PROPOSE TO SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATE U ISOTOPE BEHAVIOR IN SUBOXIC AND FERRUGINOUS SETTINGS TO REFINE OUR ABILITY TO INTERPRET OUR U ISOTOPE DATA. OUR PROPOSED WORK INVOLVES: 1) BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC U-REDUCTION EXPERIMENTS TO CONSTRAIN FRACTIONATION FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH A VARIETY OF U-REDUCTION PATHWAYS IN THE PRESENCE OF CA; 2) COMPARISON OF U ISOTOPE SEDIMENT PROFILES FROM TWO MODERN SUBOXIC ANALOGUES; AND 3) WATER AND SEDIMENT U ISOTOPE MEASUREMENTS FROM TWO MODERN FERRUGINOUS ENVIRONMENTS. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL INVESTIGATE BOTH MICROBIALLY-MEDIATED AND ABIOTIC U-REDUCTION UNDER A VARIETY OF CONDITIONS, FOCUSING ON HOW CA CONCENTRATIONS (WHICH AFFECTS U-SPECIATION) AND THE REDUCTANT (H2S, FE(II)AQ, MICROBIAL FE-REDUCERS) INFLUENCE U ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION. WE WILL CONSTRAIN U ISOTOPE FRACTION UNDER SUBOXIC AND ANOXIC CONDITIONS USING PUBLICLY-AVAILABLE ODP CORES FROM TWO PROMINENT UPWELLING ZONES: THE OMAN AND PERU MARGINS. SEDIMENT PROFILES AT THESE SITES RECORD EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION OF THE OXYGEN MINIMUM ZONE ON MILLENNIAL TIMESCALES, ALLOWING US TO INVESTIGATE U ISOTOPE BEHAVIOR UNDER A RANGE OF LOW-OXYGEN, LOW-SULFIDE CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED IN THESE BASINS OVER THE PAST 30,000 YEARS. FINALLY, WE WILL EXPLORE U ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION UNDER FERRUGINOUS CONDITIONS IN TWO FERRUGINOUS LAKE ANALOGS, CANYON LAKE (MICHIGAN) AND KABUNO BAY (EAST AFRICA).

THIS SYNCHROTRON HAS THE BEST UV FOURIER TRANSFORM SPECTROMETER AVAILABLE TODAY FOR PHOTON WAVELENGTHS<300 NM. WE GENERATE SO AND S2 BY RF DISCHARGE IN SO2 AND H2S, RESPECTIVELY, AND THEN WE MEASURE THE UV ABSORPTION SPECTRUM IN THE SO AND S2. WE WILL ALSO USE UV PHOTOFRAGMENT INSTRUMENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS (UCD) TO MEASURE ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION IN S ATOMS PRODUCED FROM SO PHOTODISSOCIATION. VELOCITY-MAP IMAGING IN A TIME-OF-FLIGHT MASS SPECTROMETER WILL BE USED TO ELUCIDATE THE EXACT STATE PARAMETERS FOR THE PRODUCT S ATOMS, ALLOWING US TO FULLY CHARACTERIZE THE ABUNDANCES OF ISOTOPIC S ATOMS PRODUCED DURING PHOTOLYSIS OF SO, A PROCESS THAT WOULD HAVE OCCURRED IN THE ANCIENT ATMOSPHERE.

ONE TECHNIQUE USED TO EXAMINE THE CURRENT IMPACT RATE IS TO LOOK FOR SURFACE CHANGES IN A BEFORE AND AFTER IMAGE WITH SIMILAR LIGHTING, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS A TEMPORAL IMAGE PAIR. RECENTLY, ANALYSIS OF TEMPORAL IMAGES ACQUIRED WITH THE LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (LRO) NARROW ANGLE CAMERA (NAC) AND WIDE ANGLE CAMERA (WAC) [3] HAS REVEALED HUNDREDS OF NEWLY FORMED IMPACT CRATERS AND THOUSANDS OF OTHER SURFACE CHANGES [4,5]. ONE LIMITATION TO THIS TECHNIQUE IS THE REQUIREMENT THAT TWO IMAGES MUST COVER THE SAME SURFACE AREA UNDER SIMILAR ILLUMINATION CONDITIONS. BY LEVERAGING IMAGES FROM MULTIPLE MISSIONS, WE CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF IMAGES THAT SATISFY THESE RESTRICTIONS AS WELL AS INCREASE THE TIME BETWEEN THE OBSERVATIONS. FIRST, WE WILL COMPARE RECENTLY DIGITIZED APOLLO METRIC PHOTOGRAPHS [6] FROM THE 1970''S TO LRO WAC IMAGES WITH SIMILAR LIGHTING CONDITIONS. NEXT, WE WILL COMPARE THE NEAR GLOBAL IMAGE DATASET FROM THE SELENE TERRAIN CAMERA (TC) ACQUIRED BETWEEN 2008 AND 2009 TO A SUBSET OF OVER A MILLION PUBLICLY AVAILABLE LRO NAC IMAGES [7]. THESE MULTI-MISSION COMPARISON WILL ENABLE A MORE ROBUST ESTIMATE OF THE CURRENT CRATERING RATE ON THE MOON FOR CRATERS RANGING BETWEEN 20-100 M, WHICH IS A KEY DIAMETER RANGE WHEN CALCULATING MODEL AGES OF YOUNG SURFACES USING CRATER SIZE FREQUENCY STATISTICS. FURTHERMORE, ANALYSIS OF THESE RECENT SURFACE CHANGES WILL ALSO PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE CRATER FORMATION PROCESS, THE DISTRIBUTION OF EJECTA AND RESULTING RAYS, AS WELL AS AID IN QUANTIFYING THE NUMBER OF CORRESPONDING SECONDARY CHANGES THAT FORM WITH EACH EVENT [5]. METHODOLOGY: WE WILL FIRST SELECT WAC IMAGES ACQUIRED UNDER SIMILAR LIGHTING CONDITION TO THAT OF THE METRIC PHOTOGRAPHS. WE WILL THEN MAP PROJECT AND CO-REGISTER EACH WAC IMAGE TO THE DIGITAL METRIC PHOTOGRAPH CORRECTING ANY PLANIMETRIC OFFSETS BETWEEN THE TWO DATASETS AND ALIGN ALL THE FEATURES TO WITHIN A PIXEL. THEN, BY LEVERAGING IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED BY OUR TEAM TO PROCESS BEFORE AND AFTER LRO NAC IMAGE PAIRS [5], WE WILL SCAN AND IDENTIFY SURFACE CHANGES IN THE TEMPORAL PAIRS. THE SAME TECHNIQUE WILL BE APPLIED TO LRO NAC AND TC IMAGES. DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE NAC AND TC DATASET, A SEMI-AUTOMATIC CHANGE DETECTION PROGRAM WILL BE USED TO LOCATE CHANGES BASED ON REFLECTANCE VARIATIONS AND CHANGES IN SURFACE TEXTURE. THE PROGRAM WAS USED IN [5] AND PROVIDES A LIST OF POTENTIAL NEW FEATURES FOR MANUAL INSPECTION AND CLASSIFICATION. THIS APPROACH REDUCES THE TIME TO MANUALLY INSPECT IMAGE PAIRS BY PROVIDING CROPPED CUTOUTS WITH THE PUTATIVE CHANGES ENABLING RAPID AND SYSTEMATIC PROCESSING OF THOUSANDS OF TEMPORAL PAIRS. BY MEASURING AND TRACKING THE SIZE DISTRIBUTION, SPATIAL COVERAGE, AND TIME BETWEEN EACH TEMPORAL PAIR, WE WILL DERIVE A NEW IMPACT RATE FOR CRATERS<#tilde#100 M. RELEVANCE: THIS PROPOSAL IS IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE LDAP REQUEST FOR INVESTIGATIONS FOCUSED ON LUNAR CHANGE DETECTION. OUR TEAM WILL IDENTIFY, CLASSIFY AND DOCUMENT SURFACE CHANGES USING BEFORE IMAGES PROVIDED BY APOLLO METRIC CAMERA [6] AND SELENE TC [7] AND AFTER IMAGES PROVIDED BY THE LRO NAC AND WAC [3].

THERE ARE GEOCHEMICAL INDICATORS OF OCEAN-BASIN-SCALE OXYGENATED AND ANOXIC (0 UM O2) CONDITIONS, BUT CURRENTLY THERE IS NOT A GLOBAL GEOCHEMICAL TOOL TO DETECT WHEN LARGE PARTS OF THE OCEANS ARE IN AN INTERMEDIATE-LEANING-TOWARD-ANOXIC CONDITION TERMED  SUBOXIC  (&LT;10 UM O2). DETECTING SUBOXIC CONDITIONS IS PARTICULARL IMPORTANT BECAUSE SOME AEROBIC ORGANISMS CAN LIVE IN EXTREMELY LOW-O2 WATERS (DOWN TO #tilde#10 NM O2 STOLPER ET AL. 2010), AND SO IT IS OF IMPORT TO KNOW WHEN LARGE PARTS OF THE OCEAN FIRST CROSSED FROM ANOXIC TO SUBOXIC. RHENIUM (RE) ISOTOPES (D187RE) MEASURED IN MARINE SEDIMENTARY ROCKS ARE A NOVEL GLOBAL PALEOREDOX TOOL THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE THE FIRST PROXY THAT CAN DETECT SUBOXIC CONDITIONS. THE ABILITY OF RE ISOTOPES TO TRACK SUBOXIC CONDITIONS COMES FROM THE UNIQUE GEOCHEMICAL BEHAVIOR OF THIS ELEMENT. UNDER OXIC CONDITIONS, RE EXISTS PRIMARILY AS PERRHENATE (REVIIO4-), AN ION THAT IS HIGHLY UNREACTIVE AND THEREFORE ACCUMULATES IN SEAWATER (E.G., KOIDE ET AL., 1986 COLODNER ET AL., 1993). IN LOW-O2 CONDITIONS, REVII IS REDUCED TO REIV, LEADING TO EFFICIENT REMOVAL COUPLED TO ORGANIC CARBON BURIAL (COLODNER ET AL., 1993,1995 KENDALL ET AL., 2010 MORFORD ET AL., 2012). RHENIUM HAS TWO STABLE ISOTOPES, 187RE AND 185RE. PRELIMINARY DATA INDICATE THAT THE LIGHT ISOTOPE IS PREFERENTIALLY REDUCED (MILLER ET AL., 2015), CAUSING A SHIFT IN THE ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION OF RESIDUAL RE REMAINING IN SEAWATER TO HEAVIER VALUES. AS A RESULT, D187RE VARIATIONS IN ANCIENT SEDIMENTS THAT SAMPLE THE ISOTOPE COMPOSITION OF SEAWATER COULD PROVIDE A SENSITIVE TOOL TO TRACK THE GLOBAL EXTENT OF SUBOXIC SEAFLOOR THROUGH TIME. IN THIS PROPOSAL I OUTLINE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RE ISOTOPE PROXY TO TRACK CHANGES IN THE EXTENT OF SUBOXIC CONDITIONS IN THE OCEAN.

THE CHALLENGE TO ANSWERING THIS QUESTION IS THAT WE HAVE BARELY BEGUN TO GLIMPSE THE DIVERSITY OF PLANET TYPES, LET ALONE CONSIDERED THEIR INNER WORKINGS AND CHEMICAL CYCLES. MOREOVER, THE DETECTABILITY OF LIFE IS DISTINCT FROM HABITABILITY. IN ORDER TO LEAVE A DISTINGUISHABLE BIOSIGNATURE, A PLANETS ECOSYSTEMS MUST PRODUCE OR CONSUME KEY COMPOUNDS AT RATES THAT EXCEED ITS NATURAL ABIOTIC CYCLES. THE COMPELLING QUESTION WE ARE CALLED FORTH TO ANSWER IS: WHICH TYPES OF PLAUSIBLE EXOPLANETS CAN HARBOR DETECTABLE ECOSYSTEMS THAT METABOLIZE FASTER THAN THEIR GEOCHEMICAL CYCLES? THROUGH A HIGHLY INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH, ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY''S CAN7 TEAM WILL ADVANCE EXOPLANET CHARACTERIZATION, PRODUCING A PERIODIC TABLE OF PLANETS THAT LAYS A FOUNDATION FOR DETECTING OF LIFE ON EXOPLANETS. THIS APPROACH HAS FOUR BROAD TASKS: IN OUR STELLAR STOICHIOMETRY TASK, WE WILL CREATE THE FIRST UNIFIED CATALOG OF HUNDREDS OF NEARBY SUN-LIKE STARS ELEMENTAL ABUNDANCES AND OTHER FACTORS LIKE HABITABLE ZONE LIFETIMES THAT AFFECT HABITABILITY. IN OUR PLANET FORMATION TASK, WE WILL MODEL MINERAL CONDENSATION AND PLANETARY ACCRETION IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS, TO DETERMINE THE RANGE OF ROCK/METAL COMPOSITIONS (E.G., MG:SI RATIOS) OF EXOPLANETS. WE WILL MODEL TRANSPORT OF WATER AND VOLATILES THROUGH DISKS, CONSIDERING PHOTOEVAPORATION BY NEARBY MASSIVE STARS AND CONSTRAINING OUR MODELS WITH ASTRONOMICAL AND METEORITIC OBSERVATIONS. WE WILL DETERMINE THE RANGE OF WATER CONTENT ON EXOPLANETS, IDENTIFYING FACTORS THAT LEAD TO WATER WORLDS OR DESERT PLANETS AND THE RELATIVE FREQUENCIES OF THESE EXOPLANET TYPES. IN OUR PLANETARY PROCESSES TASK, WE WILL MEASURE HIGH-PRESSURE MINERAL PROPERTIES AND CONSTRUCT ACCURATE MASS-RADIUS RELATIONS FOR EXOPLANETS. WE WILL MODEL THE INTERIORS AND MANTLE-SURFACE EXCHANGE IN REPRESENTATIVE EXOPLANETS, CALCULATING CONVECTION AND MIXING IN ICE VII MANTLES ON WATER WORLDS AND IN ROCKY MANTLES WITH VARIABLE MG:SI RATIO. WE WILL MODEL AND EXPERIMENTALLY CONSTRAIN EXOPLANETS SURFACE PETROLOGY, ASSESSING WHETHER ANDESITIC ROCK, CONTINENTS AND WEATHERABLE LAND CAN FORM. WE WILL PREDICT THE RATES OF GEOCHEMICAL CYCLES ON EXOPLANETS ACROSS THE FULL RANGE OF ELEMENTAL COMPOSITIONS AND WATER CONTENT. IN OUR COMPOSITIONS AND LIFE TASK, WE WILL CONDUCT FIELD STUDIES TO MEASURE METABOLIC RATES IN TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS THAT ARE ANALOGS TO WATER WORLDS (OCEAN GYRES), AND DESERT PLANET ENVIRONMENTS (SOIL CRUSTS IN THE SOUTHWEST, HOT SPRINGS IN OMAN AND YELLOWSTONE, SALTY LAGOONS IN CUATRO CIENEGAS, MEXICO). WE WILL PROBE THE GENETIC AND METABOLIC DIVERSITY AT THESE SITES, TO EXTRAPOLATE THESE METABOLIC RATES TO EXOPLANETARY ECOSYSTEMS. WE WILL INTEGRATE THESE INTERDISCIPLINARY EFFORTS BY COMPARING, FOR REPRESENTATIVE EXOPLANETS, THEIR ABIOTIC GEOCHEMICAL RATES WITH THEIR ECOSYSTEMS METABOLIC RATES. WE WILL DETERMINE THE RANGE OF EXOPLANET TYPES POSSIBLE, AND DEVELOP A METHOD TO PRIORITIZE FOR FUTURE STUDY THOSE TYPES THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO YIELD DETECTABLE EVIDENCE OF LIFE. OUR WORK ADDRESSES THREE GOALS OF THE 2008 ASTROBIOLOGY ROADMAP: GOAL 1, TO UNDERSTAND HABITABLE ENVIRONMENTS AND CHARACTERIZE EXOPLANET HABITABILITY; GOAL 5, TO UNDERSTAND THE LIFE''S ENVIRONMENTAL LIMITS AND MECHANISMS THAT CONTROL ITS EVOLUTION, METABOLIC DIVERSITY AND ACCLIMATIZATION; AND ESPECIALLY GOAL 7, DETERMINE HOW TO RECOGNIZE SIGNATURES OF LIFE ON OTHER WORLDS.

AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS AND HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS ARE FAMILIAR CONSEQUENCES WITH IMPRESSIVE CAPACITIES FOR ROCK ALTERATION, ELEMENT TRANSPORT, AND TRANSFORMATION OF ORGANIC AND INORGANIC VOLATILE COMPOUNDS. LESS FAMILIAR ARE TRANSPORT, REDISTRIBUTION, AND TRANSFORMATION PROCESSES THAT OCCUR IN CARBONIC (CO2-RICH) FLUIDS, WHICH ARE POSTULATED TO ALSO BE PRODUCTS OF ACCRETION AND DIFFERENTIATION PROCESSES. THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO GENERATE MODELS OF HOW CARBONIC RICH FLUIDS TRANSFORM OTHER VOLATILE CONSTITUENTS OF SOLAR-SYSTEM BODIES EARLY IN THEIR EVOLUTION. THE OBJECTIVES ARE TO PROVIDE THE TOOLS FOR PLANETARY SCIENTISTS TO TEST IDEAS ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CARBONIC FLUIDS IN TRANSPORTING, REDISTRIBUTING, AND TRANSFORMING ORGANIC COMPOUNDS DURING EARLY STAGES OF FORMATION OF SOLAR-SYSTEM BODIES. THESE THEORETICAL TOOLS WILL ALLOW TESTS OF THE CONSEQUENCES AND RELATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF CARBONIC AND AQUEOUS FLUIDS IN THE TRANSFORMATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS INHERITED FROM THE SOLAR NEBULA.

THESE IMAGES WERE LATER REDUCED INTO A GLOBAL MULTISPECTRAL MOSAIC AND A SERIES OF MINERALOGY AND MATURITY MAPS [3 AND REFERENCES THEREIN], WHICH WERE USED IN NUMEROUS STUDIES TO ADVANCE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE LUNAR SURFACE. AFTER THE MISSION, TWO EFFORTS WERE MADE TO IMPROVE THE GEODETIC ACCURACY OF AVAILABLE CARTOGRAPHIC PRODUCTS: CLEMENTINE LUNAR CONTROL NETWORK (CLCN) [4] AND THE UNIFIED LUNAR CONTROL NETWORK (ULCN) 2005 [5]. WITH THE SUCCESS OF THE GRAVITY RECOVERY AND INTERIOR LABORATORY (GRAIL) MISSION AND THE LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (LRO) OUR KNOWLEDGE OF LUNAR GRAVITY, TOPOGRAPHY, AND THE LOCATION OF FEATURES ON THE SURFACE HAS IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY (ELEVATIONS WITHIN 20 M AND GEODETIC ACCURACY<45 M WITHOUT GROUND CONTROL POINTS) [6,7].

WE PROPOSE A HYBRID EULERIAN/LAGRANGIAN APPROACH THAT COMBINES A EULERIAN VOLUME OF FLUID INTERFACE CAPTURING APPROACH IN THE PRIMARY ATOMIZATION REGION WITH A LAGRANGIAN APPROACH IN THE SECONDARY ATOMIZATION REGION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS A MODEL FREE OF ADJUSTABLE TUNING PARAMETERS. TO THAT END, A NOVEL DUAL SCALE LES APPROACH IS PROPOSED TO PREDICT THE PRIMARY ATOMIZATION PROCESS CLOSE TO THE FUEL INJECTOR. INSTEAD OF RELYING ON THE TRADITIONAL LES MODELING PARADIGM THAT DYNAMICS ON THE UNRESOLVED SUB-FILTER SCALE FOLLOW A CERTAIN UNIVERSALITY AND CAN BE INFERRED SOLELY FROM THE DYNAMICS ON THE RESOLVED SCALES, THE DUAL SCALE APPROACH AIMS TO MAINTAIN A REPRESENTATIVE FULLY RESOLVED REALIZATION OF THE LIQUID/GAS PHASE INTERFACE GEOMETRY. THIS NOT ONLY PROVIDES DIRECT CLOSURE MODELS FOR THE FILTERED TERMS IN THE NAVIER-STOKES EQUATION BUT ALSO, MORE IMPORTANTLY, ALLOWS FOR DIRECT CAPTURING OF THE SMALL SCALE PHASE INTERFACE DYNAMICS DURING BREAKUP, AVOIDING ANY PHENOMENOLOGICAL AD-HOC MODELS FOR THE PRIMARY ATOMIZATION PROCESS ON THE SUB-FILTER SCALE OR THE QUESTIONABLE ASSUMPTION OF UNIVERSALITY OF THE PHASE INTERFACE DYNAMICS ON THE SUBFILTER SCALE. INSTEAD, BROKEN-OFF INDIVIDUAL LIQUID STRUCTURES AND DROPS/BLOBS WITH THEIR POSITION, MOMENTUM, AND MASS ARE THE OUTCOME OF THE LES MODEL FOR THE PRIMARY ATOMIZATION PROCESS AND ARE INTERACTIVELY COUPLED TO A LAGRANGIAN SPRAY MODEL USING A NOVEL SHAPE AWARE PARALLEL DROP TRANSFER ALGORITHM.  THESE LIQUID DROPS (BLOBS) NEED FURTHER ACCURATE MODELING OF THE DROP DYNAMICS AT THE SUBGRID SCALE LEVEL. A LAGRANGIAN APPROACH HERE IS ADVANTAGEOUS AS IT ALLOWS FOR EXPLICIT MODELING OF VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE DROP DYNAMICS IMPORTANT FOR SECONDARY ATOMIZATION AND DROPLET DISPERSION. A TWO-PARAMETER STOCHASTIC BREAKUP MODEL WILL BE EMPLOYED FOR SECONDARY ATOMIZATION AT LARGE REYNOLDS AND WEBER NUMBERS REPRESENTATIVE OF REALISTIC AIRCRAFT FUEL INJECTORS. IN ADDITION, NEAR THE INJECTOR, IN THE DENSE SPRAY REGIME, THE DROPLET-DROPLET INTERACTIONS, DROPLET DEFORMATION AND INTERNAL CIRCULATION EFFECTS ON THE DRAG AND LIFT FORCES CAN BE IMPORTANT. IT IS THUS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE UPON THE STANDARD POINT-PARTICLE, TWO-WAY COUPLING BASED SUBGRID SCALE MODELS FOR SPRAY DYNAMICS. ACCOUNTING FOR THE FLUID MASS DISPLACED BY THE DROPLETS IS IMPORTANT AND REQUIRES REFORMULATION OF THE EULERIAN FLUID PHASE GOVERNING EQUATIONS TO INCLUDE CARRIER PHASE VOLUME FRACTION VARIATIONS.  TO MAKE THE DEVELOPED MODELS APPLICABLE TO REALISTIC AIRCRAFT INJECTOR GEOMETRIES A FULLY UNSTRUCTURED FLOW SOLVER WILL BE USED THAT HAS PROVEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE PAST IN SIMULATING THE FLOW IN AIRCRAFT ENGINES. THE TO BE DEVELOPED MODELS WILL BE VERIFIED USING A HIERARCHY OF DIRECT NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF EVER MORE COMPLEX ATOMIZING FLOWS, CULMINATING IN THE SIMULATION OF A REALISTIC HIGH SHEAR FUEL INJECTION NOZZLE GEOMETRY PROPOSED BY UNITED TECHNOLOGIES RESEARCH CENTER CONSISTING OF SIX LIQUID JETS INJECTING INTO A SWIRLING INNER CROSSFLOW AND FURTHER ATOMIZING WITH AN OUTER SWIRLING AIRFLOW.

ALTHOUGH THE ASTEROID BELT IS THE MAIN SOURCE OF IMPACTORS IN THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM TODAY, IT CONTAINS ONLY 0.05 LUNAR MASSES OF MATERIAL. WHILE THE ASTEROID BELT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE MASSIVE WHEN IT FORMED, IT IS UNLIKELY TO HAVE HAD GREATER THAN A LUNAR MASS SINCE THE FORMATION OF JUPITER AND THE DISSIPATION OF THE SOLAR NEBULA. BY COMPARISON, GIANT IMPACTS ONTO THE TERRESTRIAL PLANETS DURING THE LATE STAGE OF ACCRETION TYPICALLY RELEASED DEBRIS EQUAL TO SEVERAL PER CENT OF THE PLANET''S MASS INTO HELIOCENTRIC ORBIT. THE MOON-FORMING IMPACT ON EARTH, FOR EXAMPLE, RELEASED OVER A LUNAR MASS OF DEBRIS, MORE THAN HAS EVER BEEN CONTAINED IN THE ASTEROID BELT. THE BOREALIS BASIN IMPACT ON MARS RELEASED MORE DEBRIS AT ONCE, THAN THE PRESENT DAY ASTEROID BELT. ESCAPING IMPACT DEBRIS IS LESS LONG LIVED THAN THE MAIN ASTEROID BELT, AS IT IS INJECTED ON UNSTABLE, PLANET-CROSSING ORBITS. THIS SAME FACTOR HOWEVER ALSO INCREASES THE IMPACT PROBABILITY WITH THE TERRESTRIAL PLANETS AND ASTEROIDS. WITH SUCH A LARGE AMOUNT OF MASS IT SEEMS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT THESE NOW-EXTINCT POPULATIONS OF IMPACTORS SHOULD HAVE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM, MUCH AS NOW-EXTINCT RADIONUCLIDES PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE THERMAL HISTORIES OF SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES. ONE OF THE MOST OBVIOUS EFFECTS OF RE-IMPACTING DEBRIS IS THE PRODUCTION OF CRATERS. THE MOON, MARS, MERCURY AND THE LARGEST ASTEROIDS MAY BE EXPECTED TO DISPLAY EVIDENCE OF RE-IMPACTING BOMBARDMENTS IN THEIR CRATER RECORD, SUBJECT TO THEIR THERMAL STATE AND SUBSEQUENT SURFACE RE-PROCESSING. HOWEVER, IN UNDERSTANDING THE CRATERING HISTORY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM, THE CONTRIBUTION OF GIANT IMPACT DEBRIS HAS BEEN ALMOST UNIVERSALLY NEGLECTED, AND CONSTRAINING THIS CONTRIBUTION CONSTITUTES OUR PRIMARY TASK. IN ADDITION TO THE PRODUCTION OF SURFACE CRATERS, LARGE IMPACTS CAN PUNCH THROUGH THE LITHOSPHERE AND EXHUME MATERIAL FROM LARGE DEPTHS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY PERTINENT FOR RE-IMPACTS ONTO A PROGENITOR BODY WHICH WILL HAVE A DEEP MAGMA OCEAN AFTER THE GIANT IMPACT. DEPENDING ON THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF THE TARGET, THIS MAGMA OCEAN MAY FORM A FLOTATION CRUST AS ON THE MOON AND PERHAPS MERCURY, THAT WOULD ACT AS AN INSULATING BLANKET. IMPACTORS THAT PUNCH THROUGH OR DISRUPT THIS CRUST MAY ALLOW THE MAGMA OCEAN TO COOL FASTER. CONVERSELY, FOR MAGMA OCEANS THAT FREEZE FROM THE BOTTOM UP, THE ENERGY INPUT FROM RE-IMPACTS MAY KEEP THEM LIQUID FOR LONGER. THIS FEEDS BACK INTO THE CRATERING RECORD AS CRATERS WILL ONLY BE RECORDED ONCE THERE IS A STABLE, SOLID SURFACE. IN THIS SENSE THE DYNAMICS OF GIANT IMPACT DEBRIS CAN IN PRINCIPLE BECOME A CHRONOMETER OF PLANETARY SOLIDIFICATION. THE INFLUENCE OF LONG TERM RE-ACCUMULATION ON PLANETARY THERMAL EVOLUTION IS OUR SECOND TASK. OUR THIRD TASK IS TO STUDY RE-IMPACTING DEBRIS AS AN ASPECT OF TERRESTRIAL SATELLITE FORMATION. THE MOON, PHOBOS AND DEIMOS LIKELY FORMED FROM CIRCUMPLANETARY DEBRIS DISKS. THESE DISKS DID NOT EXIST IN ISOLATION. THEY, AND THE SATELLITES THAT FORM FROM THEM, WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO RE-IMPACTS BY RETURNING DEBRIS FROM THEIR FORMATIVE GIANT IMPACTS.

HOWEVER, NO GLOBAL CATALOGUE OF TECTONIC FEATURES YET EXISTS FOR DIONE OR RHEA. THE SOURCE OF STRESS THAT CAUSED SUCH A DIVERSITY OF FRACTURING IS CURRENTLY UNKNOWN. OBSERVATIONS OF CRATER RELAXATION AND FLEXURE IMPLY A HIGHER HEAT FLOW ON DIONE AND RHEA THAN PREDICTED FROM CLASSIC MODELS OF THEIR FORMATION AND EVOLUTION. SUCH HIGH HEAT FLOWS MAY EVEN HAVE MAINTAINED SUBSURFACE OCEANS ON THESE MOONS, WHICH COULD HAVE ALLOWED ENHANCED TIDAL ACTIVITY AND, PERHAPS, TIDALLY-DRIVEN FRACTURING. NEW SATELLITE FORMATION MODELS HAVE DIFFERENT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EXTENT AND TIMING OF INTERNAL HEATING, THE PRESENCE OF AN OCEAN, AND THE PAST ORBITAL ECCENTRICITY OF THESE MOONS, ALL OF WHICH AFFECT TIDALLY-DRIVEN GEOLOGIC ACTIVITY.

TO COMPLETE THESE OBJECTIVES, OUR FIRST TASK WILL BE MAPPING FRACTURES ON DIONE AND RHEA AND MEASURING THEIR ORIENTATIONS USING CASSINI ISS IMAGES. THEN, AS OUR SECOND TASK, WE WILL COMPUTE TIDAL STRESSES IN RHEOLOGICALLYLAYERED BODIES FOR A VARIETY OF ORBITAL-INTERIOR MODELS, INFORMED BY FORMATION MODELS. WE WILL INCLUDE INTERIOR STRUCTURES WITH AND WITHOUT OCEANS TO TEST THE INFERENCE OF OCEANS ON DIONE AND RHEA FROM CRATER RELAXATION AND FLEXURE MODELS AND TO CONSTRAIN THE EXTENT OF TIDAL ACTIVITY THAT CAN BE EXPECTED IN OCEAN-FREE SATELLITES. WE WILL ALSO TEST THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER ECCENTRICITIES IN ORDER TO CONSTRAIN ORBITAL EVOLUTION MODELS OF THE SATURNIAN SYSTEM THAT INVOKE SUCH SCENARIOS. OUR THIRD TASK WILL BE A STATISTICAL COMPARISON BETWEEN THE FRACTURE PATTERNS PREDICTED BY OUR TIDAL MODELS AND THE OBSERVED TECTONIC RECORDS OF DIONE AND RHEA. WE WILL USE THE OBSERVED FRACTURE ORIENTATIONS, GLOBAL PATTERN OF FRACTURING, AND TIDAL STRESS MAGNITUDES TO IDENTIFY THE MOST LIKELY ORBITAL-INTERIOR MODEL(S) FOR EACH MOON. FINALLY, WE WILL COMPARE RESULTS FOR BOTH MOONS, AS WELL AS PUBLISHED MODELS OF ENCELADUS AND MIMAS, TO DETERMINE THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE(S) OF THEIR VARYING SURFACE HISTORIES. THE POWER OF THE TIDAL-TECTONIC MODELING APPROACH, DEVELOPED BY OUR PROPOSAL TEAM, HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED AT EUROPA FOR SEVERAL TYPES OF TECTONIC FEATURES. IN RECENT YEARS, OUR TEAM HAS ADAPTED THESE METHODS TO ADDRESS VISCOELASTIC RHEOLOGIES AND VALIDATED OUR NUMERICAL TOOLS AGAINST RESULTS PUBLISHED FOR EUROPA. WE HAVE SINCE USED THESE TOOLS TO CONDUCT TIDAL-TECTONIC ANALYSES OF PLUTOS MOON, CHARON, AND SATURNS MOON, MIMAS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR PROPOSED WORK RELIES ON THESE PUBLISHED AND VALIDATED METHODS.

HOW DO STELLAR UNCERTAINTIES, ON RADIUS, EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE, METALLICITY, AND GRAVITY, AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTIES IN THE PLANETARY RADIUS AND GRAVITY, PROPAGATE INTO THE UNCERTAINTIES ON ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION AND THERMAL STRUCTURE? WILL THESE UNCERTAINTIES SIGNIFICANTLY BIAS OUR ATMOSPHERIC INTERPRETATIONS?

HOW DOES THIS 1D ATMOSPHERE ASSUMPTION BIAS OUR INTERPRETATION OF EXOPLANET SPECTRA? DO WE HAVE TO CONSIDER GLOBAL TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS SUCH AS DAY-NIGHT CONTRASTS OR HOT SPOTS? WHAT ABOUT SPATIALLY INHOMOGENEOUS MOLECULAR ABUNDANCES AND CLOUDS? HOW WILL THIS CHANGE OUR INTERPRETATIONS OF PHASE RESOLVED SPECTRA? 3. CLOUDS/HAZES: UNDERSTANDING HOW CLOUDS/HAZES IMPACT TRANSIT SPECTRA IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL IF WE ARE TO OBTAIN PROPER ESTIMATES OF BASIC ATMOSPHERIC QUANTITIES. HOW DO THE ASSUMPTIONS IN CLOUD PHYSICS BIAS OUR INFERENCES OF MOLECULAR ABUNDANCES IN TRANSMISSION?

IT ACCOUNTS FOR VARIATIONS IN WATER AMONG ALL STORAGES, THUS, IT ALLOWS QUANTIFYING THE TOTAL CHANGE IN AVAILABILITY OF WATER FOR A REGION, AND THEREWITH, ESTIMATING SEVERITY OF AN UPCOMING DROUGHT. STATES ACROSS SOUTHWEST USA, IN PARTICULAR CALIFORNIA, ARE CURRENTLY UNDERGOING A SEVERE DROUGHT ON LARGE SPATIAL EXTENTS, WHICH CAUSES SHRINKAGE OF THE SURFACE AND GROUNDWATER RESOURCES. THUS, A COMPREHENSIVE MONITORING AND MODELING SCHEMES TO ENHANCE DROUGHT MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATING THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS AT VARIOUS SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES IS AN ESSENTIAL. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH EFFORT WILL PERFORM A JOINT ANALYSIS OF THE DEFORMATION AND GRAVITY DATA TO OBTAIN MAPS OF TWS VARIATIONS, ON VARIOUS SCALES RANGING FROM 100S OF M TO 1000S OF KM. TO THIS END WE WILL ANALYZE THE ARCHIVE OF GRAVITY DATA OBTAINED BY GRACE SATELLITES (2002-PRESENT) AND THE HIGH RESOLUTION 3D DEFORMATION DATA OBTAINED THROUGH INSAR PROCESSING OF THE SAR IMAGES ACQUIRED BY VARIOUS SATELLITES (2003-PRESENT) AND GPS MEASUREMENTS OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. COMBINATION OF THE HIGH RESOLUTION DEFORMATION DATA AND CONTINUOUS GRAVITY OBSERVATIONS, THROUGH A BAYESIAN INVERSE MODELING SCHEME, PROVIDES MULTISCALE ESTIMATES OF WATER STORAGES VARIATIONS AND ITS UNCERTAINTY. THUS IT PROVIDES UNIQUE CONSTRAINTS ON THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF HYDROLOGICAL MASS FLUXES, USEFUL FOR PROBABILISTIC DROUGHT FORECAST AND MANAGEMENT. RESULTS FROM THIS PROJECT WILL ASSESS THE CAPABILITIES OF INSAR IN COMBINATION WITH GRACE AND GPS DATA TO PROVIDE HIGH RESOLUTION SPATIOTEMPORAL OBSERVATIONS OF TWS VARIATIONS. A BYPRODUCT OF THIS PROJECT IS THE LARGE SCALE MAP OF SURFACE DEFORMATION ACROSS CALIFORNIA, WHICH IS USEFUL FOR VARIOUS ENGINEERING AND SCIENTIFIC APPLICATION. THUS BROAD LONG TERM BENEFITS ARE EXPECTED. THROUGH OUTREACH PROGRAMS, WE WILL MENTOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, IN PARTICULAR, FEMALES AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES TO ENCOURAGE THEM PURSUE A CAREER IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING. THIS PROJECT PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR TWO PH.D. STUDENTS FOR TWO YEARS AND PARTIAL SUPPORTS FOR 3 EARLY CAREER SCIENTISTS. IT WILL ALSO ALLOW DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGY-BASED AND LEARNER-CENTERED CURRICULA FOR UNDERGRADUATE COURSES. ALL TOOLS DEVELOPED AND RESULTS OBTAINED HEREIN WILL BE DOCUMENTED AND AVAILABLE TO THE ENGINEERING AND EARTHSCIENCE COMMUNITIES AS OPEN SOURCE.",,,,

ONE MINERAL SYSTEM THAT RECORDS A RANGE OF PRE- AND POST-ACCRETIONARY HISTORIES ARE THE FE-SULFIDES. THEY OCCUR IN A WIDE RANGE OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL MATERIALS AND ARE ATTRIBUTED TO FORMING THROUGH A RANGE OF PROCESSES IN THE EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM. SUCH PROCESSES INCLUDE CONDENSATION, CRYSTALLIZATION/EXSOLUTION, GAS-SOLID/LIQUID REACTION, THERMAL METAMORPHISM, AND AQUEOUS-PHASE PROCESSING. PREVIOUS WORK ON HAYABUSA SAMPLES (ASTEROID 25143 ITOKAWA) IMPLIES THEIR SULFIDES FORMED BY THERMAL METAMORPHISM (BEING LL5-6 MATERIAL).THE COMPOSITIONS, MORPHOLOGIES, AND CRYSTAL STRUCTURES OF SULFIDES ARE DETERMINED BY THEIR FORMATION CONDITIONS INCLUDING TEMPERATURE, TIME, OXYGEN AND SULFUR FUGACITY, AND AQUEOUS AND THERMAL HISTORY. WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE STRUCTURES, COMPOSITIONS, AND CONTEXT OF SULFIDE MINERALS IN SAMPLES RETURNED BY HAYABUSA AND COMPARE THESE WITH SULFIDES IN CHONDRITIC METEORITES. WE WILL CONSTRAIN PARENT BODY FORMATION CONDITIONS OF ASTEROID ITOKAWA BY STUDYING ANALOGOUS SULFIDES WITH PETROGRAPHIC CONTEXT IN CHONDRITIC METEORITES. WE WILL ALSO DEVELOP A SULFIDE DATABASE TO INTERPRET CONDITIONS OF FORMATION FOR SULFIDES THAT WILL LIKELY BE FOUND IN SAMPLES RETURNED BY HAYABUSA2 AND OSIRIS-REX.WE WILL IDENTIFY CANDIDATE SULFIDE GRAINS IN CHONDRITIC METEORITES VIA SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (SEM) AND ELECTRON PROBE MICROANALYSIS (EPMA), DETERMINE GRAIN ORIENTATION VIA ELECTRON BACKSCATTER DIFFRACTION (EBSD), AND EXTRACT REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES VIA FOCUSED-ION-BEAM (FIB) TECHNIQUES. WE WILL STUDY THE COMPOSITION, TEXTURE, AND CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF INDIVIDUAL FIB SECTIONS OF THE SULFIDES VIA TRANSMISSION-ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (TEM) TO INVESTIGATE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN FORMATION MECHANISM, OXYGEN AND SULFUR FUGACITY, TEMPERATURE, AND COOLING RATE. WE WILL CONDUCT THE SAME MEASUREMENTS ON ALLOCATED SULFIDE-BEARING HAYABUSA SAMPLES. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SULFIDES (PYRRHOTITE ((FE,NI,CO,CR)1-XS) AND PENTLANDITE ((FE,NI,CO,CR)9-XS8)) IN LL, CI, CM, AND CR CHONDRITES THAT RECORD EQUILIBRATION TEMPERATURES FROM 100 TO 600DEGREES C. STUDYING SULFIDES IN METEORITES THAT RETAIN THEIR PETROGRAPHIC CONTEXT ALLOWS COMPARISONS BETWEEN ESTABLISHED GEOTHERMOMETERS AND THERMODYNAMIC VARIABLES. SINCE PYRRHOTITE-PENTLANDITE INTERGROWTHS ARE UNCOMMON IN SOME METEORITE GROUPS, SULFIDES IN SMALL RETURNED SAMPLES MAY ONLY CONSIST OF PYRRHOTITE OR PENTLANDITE. THEREFORE, TO UNDERSTAND SULFIDE FORMATION IN ASTEROIDS IT IS IMPORTANT TO STUDY SULFIDES IN METEORITES WITH WELL-KNOWN FORMATION CONDITIONS TO INVESTIGATE INDICATORS OF FORMATION IN BOTH PYRRHOTITE AND PENTLANDITE. PETROGRAPHIC, CHEMICAL, AND THERMODYNAMIC ANALYSES ON SULFIDES IN METEORITES VIA SEM, EPMA, EBSD, AND FIB-TEM WILL PROVIDE A DIVERSE SAMPLE SET OF SULFIDES FOR COMPOSITIONAL AND MICROSTRUCTURAL INVESTIGATIONS TO COMPARE WITH RETURNED SAMPLES. THE MOTIVATION FOR THIS RESEARCH IS TO IDENTIFY MICROSTRUCTURAL INDICATORS OF SULFIDE FORMATION CONDITIONS SO THAT PRE- AND/OR POST-ACCRETIONARY FORMATION CONDITIONS CAN BE DETERMINED FOR SAMPLES THAT CONTAIN SULFIDES BUT LACK PETROGRAPHIC CONTEXT, AS MAY BE THE CASE FOR RETURNED SAMPLES.THIS RESEARCH IS RELEVANT TO THE SCOPE OF THE LABORATORY ANALYSIS OF RETURNED SAMPLES (LARS) PROGRAM, BECAUSE IT AIMS TO ''MAXIMIZE THE SCIENCE DERIVED FROM PLANETARY SAMPLE-RETURN MISSIONS''. LARS IS MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THIS RESEARCH SINCE IT IS RELEVANT TO THE SCOPE OF LARS IN C.18: ''DIRECT ANALYSIS OF SAMPLES ALREADY RETURNED TO EARTH''. THE ANALYSES OF METEORITES ARE APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THEY WILL DIRECTLY SUPPORT THE INTERPRETATION OF RETURNED SAMPLES (SPECIFIED IN 1.3.3, C.18). WE WILL ANALYZE HAYABUSA SAMPLES ALREADY ALLOCATED AND DEVELOP A TIMELY DATABASE OF CHONDRITIC SULFIDES TO ASSIST IN THE INTERPRETATION OF SULFIDES IN RETURNED-SAMPLES OF ASTEROID RYUGU BY HAYABUSA2 IN 2020.",,,,

THE PRELIMINARY STUDIES SHOW THAT  NANOPRECIPITATES ARE THE HOSTS FOR MANY OF THE TRACEELEMENTS IN THE METEORITES, AND REVEALING THEIR DISTRIBUTION IS IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING THE FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM MATERIALS. THIS STUDY WILL ALSO BE EXTENDED TO METALS IN BENCUBBINITES (CB CHONDRITES), WHICH ARE PRIMITIVE, METAL-RICH BRECCIAS CLOSELY RELATED TO CR AND CH CHONDRITES. THE DISPARATE ORIGINS AND THERMAL HISTORIES OF THE METAL FROM IRON METEORITES AND BENCUBBINITES WILL PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION ON NANOPRECIPITATE FORMATION AND COMPOSITION.INTRODUCTION: TRACE ELEMENTS IN IRON METEORITES ARE USED TO MODEL CRYSTALLIZATION PROCESSES THAT OCCURED WITHIN ASTEROIDAL CORES AND TO HELP ELUCIDATE THE FORMATION AND THERMAL HISTORY OF METAL DURING NEBULAR AND PLANETARY DIFFERENTIATION PROCESSES. WHILE TRACE ELEMENTS ARE DETERMINED BY A NUMBER OF ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES SUCH AS SIMS AND LASER ABLATION ICPMS, THESE METHODS PROVIDE LITTLE DATA ON THE TRACE-ELEMENT HOSTS. STUDIES OF STEELS AND ALLOYS REVEAL THAT MINOR AND TRACE ELEMENTS OFTEN CONCENTRATE IN NANOPRECIPITATES, AND THERE HAS BEEN EXTENSIVE STUDY OF THEIR FORMATION. THEIR CHEMISTRY, MORPHOLOGY, AND DISTRIBUTION PROVIDES KEY INFORMATION ON A SAMPLES THERMAL HISTORY. FURTHER, THE ROLE OF TRACE ELEMENTS IN ALLOY FORMATION, SOLIDIFICATION, AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES IS WELL DOCUMENTED. IN CONTRAST, THERE ARE VIRTUALLY NO STUDIES OF NON-METAL AND PGE-RICH NANOPRECIPITATES IN IRON METEORITES.PRELIMINARY WORK: I INITIATED A PRELIMINARY TEM-EDS-EELS STUDY AND FOUND ABUNDANT NANOPRECIPITATES OF UNUSUAL COMPOSITIONS IN A RANGE OF IRONS AND A STONY-IRON METEORITE: ODESSA (IAB-MG), BUTLER (UNGROUPED), GIBEON (IVA), CANYON DIABLO (IAB-MG), DEEP SPRINGS (UNGROUPED), BRENHAM (PMG-AN), HENBURY (IIIAB), AND GRESSK (IIAB). NANOPRECIPITATES WERE EXTRACTED BY CUTTING A FRESH SURFACE FOLLOWED BY ETCHING WITH EITHER HNO3/METHANOL OR LIQUID BROMINE. THIS SURFACE WAS THEN COATED WITH A THIN LAYER OF C, WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FLOATED OFF THE METEORITE BY PLACING THE SAMPLE BACK IN THE ETCHANT. THE ADHERING NANOPRECIPITATES WERE THEN STUDIED BY TEM-EDS-EELS. A WIDE RANGE OF NANOPARTICLES WAS DISCOVERED, E.G., PD-BEARING ALLOYS, PGE NUGGETS, GE- AND GA- RICH NI PHOSPHIDES, CR-MO NITRIDES, AND CR SULFIDES WITH PGES. COMPOSITE NANOPRECIPITATES WERE ALSO FOUND IN CANYON DIABLO AND ODESSA, INCLUDING CR-MO NITRIDES WITH ADHERING CAPS OF PD-SN OR FE-NI-P PARTICLES. THESE COMPOSITE NANOPRECIPITATES PROVIDE INFORMATION ON PRECIPITATION SEQUENCE.PROPOSED RESEARCH: NANOPARTICLES WILL BE EXTRACTED AND CHARACTERIZED BY TEM AND ELECTRON-BEAM TECHNIQUES. GIVEN THE CHALLENGES OF QUANTIFYING HEAVY ELEMENTS BY EDS AND EELS, I WILL ALSO USE THE MICRO-PIXE AT ASU FOR THEIR ELEMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION. THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE NANOSCALE PHASE PETROLOGY OF METAL SYSTEMS, WHICH HAS AN IMPORTANT BEARING ON TRACE ELEMENT BEHAVIOR AND IN SOME CASES, LARGER SCALE STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF METAL-RICH METEORITES.PROGRAMMATIC CONSIDERATIONS: THE PROPOSED STUDY IS DESIGNED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOLID-STATE HISTORIES OF METEORITES, THEIR FORMATION, AND ACCRETION. BY ADDRESSING PROBLEMS RELATED TO PROCESSES THAT OCCURRED IN THE EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM, WE WILL PROVIDE FUNDAMENTAL NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE ORIGIN OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM AND ITS SOLID BODIES.

THE POTENTIAL OF A SEISMOMETER TO IDENTIFY LIQUID WATER THAT WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO A LANDER WILL, IN FACT, BE CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING THE GOAL OF NASA S OCEAN WORLDS AND OUTER PLANETS PROGRAM: TO ENABLE IDENTIFICATION OF EXTANT LIFE ON ANOTHER WORLD. HOWEVER, UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE SURFACE OF EUROPA PRESENT PARTICULAR CHALLENGES TO A SEISMIC INSTRUMENT DEPLOYMENT, WHICH MAY AFFECT THE PENETRATION DEPTH AND INSTALLATION ANGLE AND STABILITY OF A SEISMIC SENSOR. FURTHERMORE, UNKNOWN TRADE-OFFS EXIST BETWEEN PURSUING SEISMOLOGICAL GOALS WITH A SINGLE SEISMOMETER VERSUS A LOCALIZED ARRAY OF SEISMIC SENSORS. FINALLY, EUROPA S RADIATION AND EXTREMELY LOW-TEMPERATURE ENVIRONMENT IS SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE MOON, OR MARS, WHERE SEISMIC EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN PLANNED AND/OR CARRIED OUT. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO MATURE A MINIATURE BROADBAND SEISMOMETER FOR DEPLOYMENT ON EUROPA TO PROBE THE PROPERTIES OF ITS ICE SHELL AND INTERIOR STRUCTURE AND RECORD CURRENT ACTIVITY. RECENT ADVANCES IN MICROELECTROMECHANICAL SYSTEM (MEMS) HAVE ENABLED OPTIMIZATION OF SEISMOMETERS FOR SPACEFLIGHT SEISMIC INSTRUMENTATION. FOR EXAMPLE, A SEISMOMETER PACKAGE IS THE PRIMARY INSTRUMENT OF THE INSIGHT MISSION AND CONSISTS OF A 3-AXIS VERYBROADBAND INSTRUMENT, WHICH IS A TRADITIONAL PENDULUM SYSTEM, AND A 3-AXIS SHORT PERIOD MEMS SEISMOMETER, BUILT WITH SILICON-BASED MICROFABRICATION. HOWEVER, THIS PACKAGE HAS NOT YET ACHIEVED THE SIMULTANEOUS REQUIREMENTS FOR LOW MASS AND POWER, HIGH ROBUSTNESS, AND HIGH PERFORMANCE. ITS THEORETICAL NOISE FLOOR IS LIMITED IN SHORT PERIOD, AND THE VACUUM PACKAGING ISSUE HAS POSTPONED LAUNCH FOR AT LEAST FOR TWO YEARS. FURTHERMORE, ITS TOLERANCE ON SHOCK (2KG) AND INSTALLATION ANGLE ( 15 ) LIMITS ITS POTENTIAL USE IN OTHER MISSIONS, ESPECIALLY WITH UNKNOWN ICY SURFACE CONDITIONS ON EUROPA. WE PROPOSE TO MATURE A BROADBAND MINIATURE SEISMOMETER, WHICH USES A MEMS SENSING ELEMENT WITH IONIC LIQUID BASED ELECTROLYTE AS THE SENSING BODY. THIS DESIGN WILL SERVE AS THE BASIS OF A FLIGHT INSTRUMENT FOR A EUROPA LANDER MISSION, CURRENTLY UNDER STUDY. THIS NEW INSTRUMENT PROVIDES BOTH HIGH SENSITIVITY AND DYNAMIC RANGE, BROAD-BAND RESPONSE, AND HIGH ENVIRONMENT TOLERANCES, REACHING OR EXCEEDING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR EUROPA LANDER MISSION SUGGESTED FROM JPL EUROPA LANDER REPORT. IT ALSO HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF FLEXIBLE DEPLOYMENT METHODS DUE TO ITS HIGH SHOCK TOLERANCE (>25 KG),  180  TILT TOLERANCE, AND NO REQUIREMENT OF VACUUM SEALING. WE WILL ACHIEVE THIS GOAL THROUGH THREE OBJECTIVES: 1) MATURATION OF MINIATURE SEISMOMETER TECHNOLOGY FOR USE IN EUROPA S ENVIRONMENT, 2) DETERMINE OPTIMAL SENSOR DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION THROUGH FIELD TESTING WITH EXISTING SEISMOMETERS, 3) MODEL THE EXPECTED SEISMICITY OF EUROPA AND THE CORRESPONDING INSTRUMENT CAPABILITIES AND REQUIREMENTS TO ACHIEVE LANDER MISSION OBJECTIVES. OUR PROPOSED WORK IS RELEVANT TO THE COLDTECH PROGRAM, AS IT WOULD BRING SEISMIC SENSOR CELL, THE CORE MECHANICAL HARDWARE OF A SEISMOMETER INSTRUMENT, TO TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVEL 6 (TRL 6) FOR THE POTENTIAL EUROPA LANDER MISSION. THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES WOULD  DEVELOP AND ADVANCE THE MATURITY OF SCIENCE INSTRUMENTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE FOCUSED ON THE DETECTION OF EVIDENCE OF LIFE, ESPECIALLY EXTANT LIFE, IN THE OCEAN WORLDS OF THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM  AND PROVIDE  SPACECRAFT TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRED TO ACCESS THE OCEANS. . THE SEISMOMETER WE ARE DEVELOPING WILL BE CAPABLE OF IDENTIFYING AND PHYSICALLY CHARACTERIZING THE MOST LIKELY HABITATS ON EUROPA. ITS UNIQUE ROBUSTNESS AND FLEXIBILITY WILL MITIGATE RISK FOR THE EUROPA LANDER MISSION AND PROVIDE A NEW TOOL FOR FUTURE EXPLORATION OF OTHER OCEAN WORLDS.",,,,

(ASTS) IS PLEASED TO PROPOSE TO CONTINUE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING (AM) APPROACH FOR FABRICATING BIMETALLIC COMBUSTION CHAMBERS. OUR CHAMBER DESIGN, WHICH IS APPLICABLE TO FUTURE NASA SMALL LAUNCH VEHICLES, EXPLOITS THE COMBINED CAPABILITIES OF SELECTIVE LASER MELTING (SLM) AND MAGNETIC PULSE WELDING (MPW), IN ORDER TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING LEAD TIME AND COST AND TO IMPROVE QUALITY THROUGH EASE OF INSPECTION. THE CHAMBER WILL USE A TWO-PIECE GRCOP-84 LINER THAT IS INSERTED AND MP WELDED INTO A ONE-PIECE INCONEL 625 STRUCTURAL JACKET. THE MPW STEP WILL BE USED TO PERMANENTLY JOIN THE TWO HALVES OF THE LINER AT THE THROAT AND THE LINER ITSELF TO THE JACKET IN A STRUCTURALLY SOUND, WATERTIGHT MANNER. OUR STRUCTURAL JACKET DESIGN INCLUDES INTEGRAL PROPELLANT MANIFOLDS, WHICH ELIMINATES THE TIME AND EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH MACHINING OR CASTING SEPARATE COMPONENTS AND WELDING THEM IN PLACE. THE BENEFITS OF SUCH A DESIGN ARE SUBSTANTIAL. FIRST, IT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT FOR COMPLICATED COMPONENTS LIKE A MODERN COMBUSTION CHAMBER, AN AM MANUFACTURING APPROACH CAN DRASTICALLY REDUCE COST (BY 50% OR MORE) AND LEAD TIME (WEEKS INSTEAD OF MONTHS). SECOND, OUR PARTICULAR DESIGN OVERCOMES WEAKNESSES OF OTHER ADDITIVE DESIGNS BY ENABLING EASY INSPECTION OF THE PRINTED PARTS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE TO UNDERGO CT SCANNING OR X-RAY INSPECTION, WHICH HAS PROVEN TO BE EXCEPTIONALLY DIFFICULT FOR COMPLEX INTERNAL GEOMETRIES LIKE REGENERATIVE COOLING CHANNELS AND PROPELLANT MANIFOLDS. THIRD, OUR BASIC MATERIAL AND MANUFACTURING APPROACH IS SCALABLE TO BOOSTER CLASS COMBUSTION CHAMBERS AT A RATE CONTROLLED SOLELY BY SCALING OF THE BUILD VOLUMES AVAILABLE IN COMMERCIAL SLM MACHINES (WHICH IS OCCURRING RAPIDLY).

OUR ADAP PROGRAM TO MEASURE THE MASS LOSS FROM THE AGB AND RSG STARS IN THE MAGELLANIC CLOUDS IS NEARING COMPLETION, AND WE WISH TO EXTEND THIS SUCCESSFUL STUDY TO THE GALACTIC BULGE OF THE MILKY WAY GALAXY. METALLICITY SHOULD DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF ELEMENTS AVAILABLE TO CONDENSE DUST IN THE STAR''S OUTFLOW, SO EVOLVED STARS OF DIFFERING METALLICITIES SHOULD HAVE DIFFERING MASS-LOSS RATES.

IN ADDITION, THE GALACTIC BULGE, LIKE THE CLOUDS, IS LOCATED AT A WELLDETERMINED DISTANCE (#tilde#8 KPC), THEREBY REMOVING THE DISTANCE AMBIGUITIES THAT PRESENT A MAJOR UNCERTAINTY IN DETERMINING MASS-LOSS RATES AND LUMINOSITIES FOR EVOLVED STARS. TO MODEL PHOTOMETRIC OBSERVATIONS OF OUTFLOWING DUST SHELLS AROUND EVOLVED STARS, WE HAVE CONSTRUCTED THE GRID OF RED SUPERGIANT AND ASYMPTOTIC GIANT BRANCH MODELS (GRAMS; SARGENT ET AL 2011; SRINIVASAN ET AL 2011) USING THE RADIATIVE TRANSFER CODE 2DUST (UETA AND MEIXNER 2003).

IT WILL COMBINE ANALYSIS OF NASA HELIOPHYSICS SYSTEM OBSERVATORY DATA PRODUCTS, AND RELEVANT DATA-DRIVEN MODELS INTO AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM FOR THE CHARACTERIZATION OF CORONAL WAVES AND SHOCKS AND THE EVALUATION OF THEIR CAPABILITY TO ACCELERATE SEPS. CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS (CMES) ARE ONE OF THE MAIN PHENOMENA THAT MODIFY SPACE WEATHER IN THE HELIOSPHERE. AMONG OTHER EFFECTS, DURING THEIR HELIOSPHERIC PROPAGATION THEY ROUTINELY DRIVE COLLISIONLESS SHOCKS, WHICH IN TURN MAY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT FLUXES OF SOLAR ENERGETIC PARTICLES (SEPS). RECENT STUDIES HAVE USED EXTREME UV (EUV) OBSERVATIONS TO SHOW THE CONNECTION OF CORONAL EUV WAVES TO METRIC RADIO TYPE II BURSTS IN THE CORONAL PHASES OF CMES. THIS SIGNIFIES THAT CME-DRIVEN SHOCKS CAN EXIST LOW IN THE CORONA, AND MAY ALREADY ACCELERATE SEPS AT THEIR VERY INITIAL STAGES. CHARACTERIZING CORONAL SHOCKS HAS ONLY BECOME POSSIBLE THROUGH REMOTE MEASUREMENTS FROM INSTRUMENTS ON THE SOHO, STEREO, AND SDO SPACECRAFT. EUV IMAGING WITH THE ATMOSPHERIC IMAGING ASSEMBLY(AIA) INSTRUMENT ON SDO HAS PROVED PARTICULARLY USEFUL FOR DETECTING LARGE-SCALE SHORT-LIVED CORONAL BRIGHT FRONTS, WHICH, COMBINED WITH RADIO OBSERVATIONS, HOLDS GREAT PROMISE FOR EARLY CME-DRIVEN SHOCK CHARACTERIZATION CAPABILITY. THIS CHARACTERIZATION CAN FURTHER BE AUTOMATED, AND RELATED TO MODELS OF PARTICLE ACCELERATION TO PRODUCE ESTIMATES OF PARTICLE FLUXES EARLY IN EVENTS. THE CASHEW FRAMEWORK WILL BE EXTENSIVELY TESTED AND VALIDATED ON A REPRESENTATIVE LIST OF CORONAL BRIGHT FRONT EVENTS. SOME OF THE SPECIFIC SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED THROUGH ANALYSES OF THE PROPOSED DATA PRODUCTS ARE 1) TO WHAT ENERGIES CAN CORONAL SHOCKS ACCELERATE SOLAR ENERGETIC PARTICLES? 2) HOW DOES CORONAL SHOCK ACCELERATION EFFICIENCY VARY WITH TIME AND LOCATION? 3) WHAT REMOTE OBSERVABLES ARE RELEVANT FOR DETERMINATION OF SHOCK ACCELERATION EFFICIENCY? THE PRODUCTS OF THE PROPOSED WORK WILL ENABLE AND FACILITATE FUTURE STUDIES OF CORONAL SHOCK WAVE PROPERTIES, AS WELL AS THEIR INFLUENCE ON SEP PRODUCTION AND HELIOSPHERIC CONNECTIVITY.

WE WILL ALSO COORDINATE MULTI-COLOR PHOTOMETRY AND SPECTRA TO CLASSIFY DISCOVERED TRANSIENTS USING LICK, GEMINI, AND KECK. IN CAMPAIGN C5 AND C6, WE SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFIED 4 SNE WITH DECAM OBSERVATIONS, OF WHICH WE CLASSIFIED 2 WITH GEMINI SPECTRA AS SN IA. THESE DATA, COUPLED WITH HIGH PRECISION 30 MINUTE K2 DATA WILL HAVE ENORMOUS LEGACY VALUE. METHODS: WE HAVE DEVELOPED AND PROVEN A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL DETRENDING METHOD THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY SOLVES FOR THE SAWTOOTH PATTERN CAUSED BY POINTING MOTION AND FOR THE COEFFICIENTS OF VECTORS FROM PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS OF TARGETS ON THE SAME CHANNEL. THIS ITERATIVE TECHNIQUE PERMITS US TO DEFINE APERTURE SIZES BETTER SUITED TO THIS PROBLEM AND TO MAKE EXCELLENT CORRECTIONS FOR SENSITIVITY VARIATIONS ON ALL TIME SCALES. TO PROPERLY CORRECT SN LIGHT CURVES, THE TECHNIQUE IS APPLIED TO THE QUIET TIME BEFORE THE EVENT AND THEN EXTRAPOLATED TO THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN.

THIS H I SURVEY WILL CONSTITUTE A METAL-INDEPENDENT VIEW OF THE BARYONS IN THE GALACTIC HALO AT A LEVEL OVER 1000 TIMES MORE SENSITIVE THAN 21 CM SURVEYS, AND IT CAN BE CONDUCTED WITH ARCHIVAL DATA ALONE. 67 AGN ARE AVAILABLE IN THE FUSE ARCHIVES WITH SUITABLE PROPERTIES (S/N>4 AT 977 A), AND THE DATA ARE REDUCED AND READY FOR ANALYSIS.WITH THESE DATA, WE WILL CALCULATE HVC SKY COVERING FRACTIONS IN H I ABSORPTION AND CONDUCT HVC METALLICITY MEASUREMENTS IN SIGHTLINES WITH UV METAL ABSORPTION IN HST/COS OR HST/STIS SPECTRA.

THE OST, A MID- TO FAR- INFRARED OBSERVATORY CONCEPT, IS BEING DEVELOPED AS A MAJOR NASA MISSION TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE NEXT DECADAL SURVEY WITH SUPPORT FROM NASA HEADQUARTERS. THE OBJECTIVE OF SUCH A FACILITY IS TO ALLOW RAPID SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEYS OF THE HIGH REDSHIFT UNIVERSE AT 420-800  M, USING ARRAYS OF INTEGRATED SPECTROMETERS WITH MODERATE RESOLUTIONS (R= #tilde#1000), TO CREATE A POWERFUL NEW DATA SET FOR EXPLORING GALAXY EVOLUTION AND THE GROWTH OF STRUCTURE IN THE UNIVERSE. A SECOND OBJECTIVE OF OST IS TO PERFORM HIGHER RESOLUTION (R#tilde#10,000-100,000) SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEYS AT 20-300  M, A UNIQUELY POWERFUL TOOL FOR EXPLORING THE EVOLUTION OF PROTOPLANETARY DISKS INTO FLEDGLING SOLAR SYSTEMS. FINALLY THE OST AIMS TO OBTAIN SENSITIVE MID-INFRARED (5-40  M) SPECTROSCOPY OF THERMAL EMISSION FROM ROCKY PLANETS IN THE HABITABLE ZONE USING THE TRANSIT METHOD. THESE OST SCIENCE OBJECTIVES ARE VERY EXCITING AND REPRESENT A WELL-ORGANIZED COMMUNITY AGREEMENT. HOWEVER, THEY ARE ALL IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH WITHOUT NEW DETECTOR TECHNOLOGY, AND THE OST CAN T BE RECOMMENDED OR APPROVED IF SUITABLE DETECTORS DO NOT EXIST. IN ALL OF THE ABOVE INSTRUMENT CONCEPTS, PHOTON-COUNTING DIRECT DETECTORS ARE MISSIONENABLING AND ESSENTIAL FOR REACHING THE SENSITIVITY PERMITTED BY THE CRYOGENIC ORIGINS SPACE TELESCOPE AND THE PERFORMANCE REQUIRED FOR ITS IMPORTANT SCIENCE PROGRAMS. OUR GROUP HAS DEVELOPED AN INNOVATIVE DESIGN FOR AN OPTICALLY-COUPLED KID THAT CAN REACH THE PHOTON-COUNTING SENSITIVITY REQUIRED BY THE AMBITIOUS SCIENCE GOALS OF THE OST MISSION. A KID IS A PLANAR MICROWAVE RESONATOR PATTERNED FROM A SUPERCONDUCTING THIN FILM, WHICH RESPONDS TO INCIDENT PHOTONS WITH A CHANGE IN ITS RESONANCE FREQUENCY AND DISSIPATION. THIS DETECTOR RESPONSE IS INTRINSICALLY FREQUENCY MULTIPLEXED, AND CONSEQUENTLY KIDS AT DIFFERENT RESONANCE FREQUENCIES CAN BE READ OUT USING STANDARD DIGITAL RADIO TECHNIQUES, WHICH ENABLES MULTIPLEXING OF #tilde#10,000S OF DETECTORS. IN OUR PHOTON-COUNTING KID DESIGN WE EMPLOY A SMALL-VOLUME (AND THIN) SUPERCONDUCTING AL INDUCTOR TO ENHANCE THE PER-PHOTON RESPONSIVITY, AND LARGE PARALLEL-PLATE NBTIN CAPACITORS ON SINGLE-CRYSTAL SILICON-ON-INSULATOR (SOI) SUBSTRATES TO ELIMINATE FREQUENCY NOISE. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A COMPREHENSIVE DESIGN DEMONSTRATING THAT PHOTON-COUNTING SENSITIVITY IS POSSIBLE IN A SMALL-VOLUME AL KID. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED ULTRA-HIGH QUALITY FACTORS IN RESONATORS MADE OF VERY THIN (#tilde#10 NM) AL FILMS WITH LONG ELECTRON LIFETIMES. THESE ARE THE CRITICAL MATERIAL PARAMETERS FOR REACHING PHOTON-COUNTING SENSITIVITY LEVELS. IN OUR PROPOSED WORK PLAN OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO IMPLEMENT THESE HIGH QUALITY FILMS INTO OUR OPTICALLYCOUPLED SMALL-VOLUME KID DESIGN AND DEMONSTRATE PHOTON-COUNTING SENSITIVITY. THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PHOTON-COUNTING TECHNOLOGY WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE SENSITIVITY OF THE OST MISSION, MAKING IT MORE SCIENTIFICALLY COMPETITIVE THAN ONE BASED ON POWER DETECTORS. PHOTON-COUNTING AT THE BACKGROUND LIMIT PROVIDES A X4 INCREASE IN OBSERVATION SPEED OVER THAT OF BACKGROUND-LIMITED POWER DETECTION, SINCE THERE IS NO NEED TO MEASURE AND SUBTRACT A ZERO POINT. PHOTON-COUNTING DETECTORS WILL ENABLE AN INSTRUMENT ON THE OST TO OBSERVE THE FINE STRUCTURE LINES OF GALAXIES WHICH ARE CURRENTLY ONLY OBSERVABLE AT REDSHIFTS OF Z#tilde#1, OUT TO REDSHIFTS OF Z=6, PROBING THE EARLY STAGES OF GALAXY, STAR AND PLANET FORMATION. OUR PHOTONCOUNTING DETECTORS WILL ALSO ENABLE ENTIRELY NEW SCIENCE, INCLUDING THE MAPPING OF THE COMPOSITION AND EVOLUTION OF WATER AND OTHER KEY VOLATILES IN PLANET-FORMING MATERIALS AROUND LARGE SAMPLES OF NEARBY YOUNG STARS.",,,,

ONE KEY PATHWAY IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF FREE-FLOATING SUBSTELLAR OBJECTS THAT NOT ONLY SHARE COMMON TEMPERATURES WITH EXOPLANETS BUT ALSO COMMON MASSES AND THUS SURFACE GRAVITIES. IN RECENT YEARS, SEARCHES FOR EVER COLDER FREE-FLOATING OBJECTS HAVE STEADILY PUSHED THE CENSUS TO EVER LOWER MASSES AND FINALLY INTO THIS LONG-SOUGHT PLANETARY-MASS REGIME (5-15 JUPITER MASSES;  Y  DWARFS). THE EMPIRICAL BACKBONE OF THE EXPLORATION OF THESE NEW SUBSTELLAR SAMPLES IS THE ACCURATE MEASUREMENT OF DISTANCES VIA TRIGONOMETRIC PARALLAXES. DISTANCES ALLOW US TO MAKE EMPIRICAL SEQUENCES OF ABSOLUTE MAGNITUDE VERSUS COLOR AND SPECTRAL TYPE TO COMPARE TO BETTER STUDIED  NORMAL  BROWN DWARFS, AS WELL AS PROVIDING ABSOLUTE BOLOMETRIC FLUXES AND THEREBY LUMINOSITIES AND TEMPERATURES. HOWEVER, UNLIKE SIMPLE PHOTOMETRY OR SPECTROSCOPY, PARALLAX MEASUREMENTS ARE TIME CONSUMING AND PRONE TO LARGE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS WHEN ATTEMPTED BY COMBINING DATA FROM MULTIPLE TELESCOPES AND BANDPASSES. SPITZER/IRAC IS POISED TO DELIVER THE DEFINITIVE SAMPLE OF PARALLAX DISTANCES FOR THE COLDEST BROWN DWARFS. IT IS THE ONLY FACILITY CAPABLE OF MEASURING HIGH-PRECISION ASTROMETRY EFFICIENTLY FOR A LARGE SAMPLE OF SUCH FAINT SUBSTELLAR OBJECTS, AS VALIDATED BY OUR PAST WORK. SPITZER WAS NEVER INTENDED TO DELIVER HIGH QUALITY ASTROMETRY, BUT USING OUR CUSTOM BUILT ASTROMETRIC PIPELINE WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY PRODUCED THE FIRST PRECISE IRAC ASTROMETRY AND MEASURED DISTANCES FOR A SMALL INITIAL SAMPLE OF THE COLDEST BROWN DWARFS (DUPUY&KRAUS 2013). WE SHOWED THAT IN SPITE OF THE SEEMINGLY SUBTLE SPECTRAL CHANGES FROM T8 TO Y0 (ONLY 2 SUBTYPES), THE MEAN EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE PLUMMETS BY ALMOST A FACTOR OF 2, FROM #tilde#700 K FOR T8 DWARFS TO #tilde#400 K FOR Y0 DWARFS. EVEN IN THIS SMALL SAMPLE, WE FOUND SOME OBJECTS THAT SEEMED TO DEFY THE EXPECTATION THAT LATER SPECTRAL TYPE CORRESPONDS TO COOLER TEMPERATURE. THIS MAY POINT TO COMPLEXITY IN THE ATTEMPT TO SPECTRAL TYPE PLANETARY MASS OBJECTS, AS OTHER PARAMETERS LIKE GRAVITY OR NONEQUILIBRIUM CHEMISTRY COULD BECOME JUST AS IMPORTANT AS TEMPERATURE. HOWEVER, A SAMPLE LARGER THAN ONE OR TWO OBJECTS PER SPECTRAL TYPE BIN IS REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY DEFINITIVE STATEMENTS ABOUT PHYSICAL TRENDS. WE PROPOSE A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF THE COLDEST KNOWN BROWN DWARFS BY MEASURING ACCURATE DISTANCES FROM SPITZER PARALLAXES. WE WILL USE ALL DATA IN THE SPITZER ARCHIVE SUITABLE FOR PARALLAXES TO PERFORM A HOMOGENEOUS ANALYSIS OF A COMPLETE SAMPLE OF THE LATEST T AND Y DWARFS. OUR PROPOSED WORK WILL ROUGHLY TRIPLE THE SAMPLE SIZE AND FILL IN MAJOR GAPS AT THE T9.5 AND>Y0 SPECTRAL TYPES (#tilde#300-350 K) THAT PRODUCED SOME OF THE MOST PUZZLING RESULTS IN OUR PREVIOUS WORK. THE LONGER TIME BASELINE WILL ENABLE>3X MORE PRECISE PARALLAX MEASUREMENTS THAN IS POSSIBLE FROM THE GROUND FOR SIMILARLY FAINT OBJECTS. THE RESULTING EMPIRICAL SEQUENCES OF ABSOLUTE MAGNITUDE WILL PROVIDE A TOUCHSTONE FOR COMPARING BOTH MODELS AND DATA, E.G., FROM DIRECTLY IMAGED EXOPLANETS. WE WILL ALSO USE THE ABSOLUTE FLUXES TO DERIVE BOLOMETRIC LUMINOSITIES FOR OUR SAMPLE. COMBINING THESE WITH WELL-ESTABLISHED MODEL RADII WILL RESULT IN ROBUST TEMPERATURE DETERMINATIONS THAT WILL ALLOW DEEPER SCRUTINY OF WHETHER TEMPERATURE OR A MORE COMPLEX MIX OF PHYSICAL PROPERTIES DRIVES SPECTRAL VARIATIONS IN THE PLANETARY MASS REGIME. FINALLY, OUR ASTROMETRIC MONITORING WILL NATURALLY ALLOW US TO EXAMINE THE POPULATION S KINEMATICS, AND THE LONG TIME BASELINE WILL ALLOW A NOVEL SEARCH FOR LOWER MASS COMPANIONS VIA NONLINEAR PERTURBATIONS. OUR PROPOSED WORK WILL RESULT IN A DEFINITIVE BENCHMARK SAMPLE FOR BOTH THE BROWN DWARF AND EXOPLANET COMMUNITIES, PROVIDING CONTEXT FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE EFFORTS TO CHARACTERIZE BROWN DWARFS, DIRECTLY IMAGED PLANETS, AND THE COOL TRANSITING PLANETS PROBED BY SECONDARY ECLIPSE MEASUREMENTS.",,,,

HIRMES COMBINATION OF SENSITIVITY, WAVELENGTH RANGE, AND SPECTRAL RESOLVING POWER PROVIDES A CRITICAL NEW CAPABILITY. OVER THE COURSE OF 10 MILLION YEARS, ACCRETION DISKS AROUND PRE-MAIN SEQUENCE STARS TRANSFORM FROM GAS-RICH REMNANTS OF STAR FORMATION INTO YOUNG PLANETARY SYSTEMS. THE PRIMARY PLANET-FORMING REGION IN THESE PROTOPLANETARY DISKS IS LOCATED WITHIN 20 ASTRONOMICAL UNITS AU OF THE SYSTEM S CENTER. THIS REGION IS CHARACTERIZED BY A MIXTURE OF WARM AND COLD GAS, DUST AND ICE, AND HAS BEEN ANALYZED USING A RANGE OF MOLECULAR AND ATOMIC LINES AND SOLID-STATE FEATURES IN THE MID- TO FAR-INFRARED. HOWEVER TO DELVE MORE DEEPLY TOWARD UNDERSTANDING PLANET FORMATION AND THE CREATION OF PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES REQUIRES THE HIGH-RESOLUTION MID- TO FAR-INFRARED (IR) SPECTROSCOPY HIRMES PROVIDES. HIRMES IS DESIGNED TO PERFORM DETAILED STUDIES OF IMPORTANT DISK CONSTITUENTS: WATER VAPOR AND ICE THESE MATERIALS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN FORMING GIANT PLANET CORES AND PRODUCING HABITABLE CONDITIONS ON TERRESTRIAL PLANETS, AND NEUTRAL OXYGEN, AT TRACER OF DISK CHEMISTRY AND RADIAL STRUCTURE. HIRMES ALSO MEASURES MOLECULAR HYDROGEN THROUGH ITS TRACER, HYDROGEN DEUTERIDE HD WHICH SHOULD MAKE UP MOST OF A PROTOPLANETARY DISK MASS, BUT IS NOT ACCESSIBLE WITH EXISTING INSTRUMENTS. HIRMES, WITH ITS HIGH SPECTRAL RESOLUTION, RESOLVES NARROW EMISSION LINES AND INDEPENDENTLY DETERMINES THEIR ORIGIN IN A DISK FROM VELOCITY INFORMATION, THUS BREAKING DEGENERACIES IN COMPLEX DISK MODELS. HIRMES MEASUREMENTS TRACE DISK DENSITY, TEMPERATURE, AND VELOCITY STRUCTURE, AS WELL AS H2O VAPOR AND ICE TO LOCATE THE TRANSITION ZONE BETWEEN GASEOUS AND FROZEN WATER. OBSERVATIONS OF H2 OR BETTER YET ITS DEUTERATED COUNTERPART HD, CAN UNIQUELY DETERMINE THE DISK GAS MASS AND THE DEGREE OF SETTLING OF THE SOLID MATERIAL IN DISKS.

THE INFRARED SPECTROGRAPH IRS ON SPITZER PROVIDED DATA UP TO #tilde#37 M WITH A SPECTRAL RESOLVING POWER OF 600, WHICH IS TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE LESS THAN HIRMES AND INSUFFICIENT TO RESOLVE LINES FROM PROTOPLANETARY DISKS. HIRMES RANGE CONTAINS THE TWO WATER-ICE FEATURES THAT ARE THE ONLY EMISSION TRACERS OF ICE IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS AND HAVE BEEN POORLY COVERED BY PREVIOUS SPACE MISSIONS. THIS ENSEMBLE OF DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS, WHICH WILL BE UNIQUE TO SOFIA WHEN IT INCORPORATES HIRMES, PROMISES TO PROVIDE NEW INSIGHT INTO THE EVOLUTION OF PLANETARY SYSTEMS. HIRMES ON SOFIA CONTRIBUTES IN A UNIQUE WAY, EVEN IN THE ERA OF ATACAMA LARGE MILLIMETER ARRAY ALMA, JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE JWST, HERSCHEL, SPITZER, AND ALL CURRENT AND PLANNED SOFIA INSTRUMENTS. THE HERSCHEL/PHOTOCONDUCTOR ARRAY CAMERA AND SPECTROMETER PACS PROVIDED SPECTRAL DATA AT WAVELENGTHS>55 M, BUT ITS RELATIVELY LOW SPECTRAL RESOLVING POWER IS INSUFFICIENT TO OBTAIN LINE PROFILES FROM GALACTIC SOURCES.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE SPEED AND PROFILE OF THE MERIDIONAL FLOW DETERMINES THE DURATION OF THE SOLAR CYCLE IN FLUX-TRANSPORT DYNAMO MODELS, ITS RISE AND FALL PATTERN, THE POLAR FIELD STRENGTH AND THE TIMING OF ITS REVERSAL. THE STRENGTH OF THE POLAR FIELD OF THE PREVIOUS MINIMUM PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN DETERMINING THE STRENGTH OF THE NEXT CYCLE. THEREFORE IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE EVOLUTION OF THE POLAR FIELD, WHICH IS LARGELY GOVERNED BY THE TRANSPORT BY MERIDIONAL CIRCULATION. WE PROPOSE TO STUDY THE MERIDIONAL FLOW IN THE SOLAR CONVECTION ZONE FROM THE SURFACE TO THE NEAR-SURFACE SHEAR LAYER USING RING-DIAGRAM ANALYSIS AND IN THE LOWER CONVECTION ZONE USING TIME-DISTANCE ANALYSIS ANALYZING SDO/HMI DOPPLERGRAMS. WE WILL THEN ASSIMILATE THE MERIDIONAL FLOW AND THE SURFACE MAGNETIC FIELD FROM SDO/ HMI INTO FLUX-TRANSPORT DYNAMO MODELS AND DRIVE THE MODELS WITH THE FLOWS. TO COVER MORE THAN ONE SOLAR CYCLE, WE WILL ANALYZE MDI DATA SETS. THE GOALS OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT ARE (I) TO DETERMINE THE INFLUENCE OF THE MERIDIONAL FLOW ON DYNAMO-GENERATED MAGNETIC FIELDS DURING DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE SOLAR CYCLE AND (II) TO USE THE RESULTS TO PREDICT THE POLAR FIELDS DURING THE UPCOMING CYCLE MINIMUM AND THE STRENGTH OF CYCLE 25. THIS IS TIMELY SINCE SDO/HMI OBSERVATIONS COVER SOLAR CYCLE 24 AND THE HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF HMI ALLOWS US TO MEASURE SUBSURFACE MERIDIONAL FLOWS AT HIGH LATITUDES TO ABOUT 75 DEGREE. BY ASSIMILATING MERIDIONAL FLOWS AND SURFACE MAGNETIC FIELDS FROM SDO/HMI INTO DYNAMO MODELS, WE WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE HOW WELL FLOW MEASUREMENTS CAN CONSTRAIN THE DYNAMO. RELEVANCE: THIS PROPOSAL DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE FIRST SCIENCE GOAL FROM THE HELIOPHYSICS DECADAL SURVEY:  DETERMINE THE ORIGINS OF THE SUN S ACTIVITY AND PREDICT THE VARIATIONS IN THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT . THE WORK PROPOSED HERE WILL GREATLY ENHANCE THE SCIENTIFIC RETURN OF THE SDO/HMI MISSION. METHODOLOGY: WE PROPOSE TO DETERMINE THE MERIDIONAL FLOW FROM SDO/HMI DOPPLERGRAMS USING TWO DIFFERENT HELIOSEISMIC TECHNIQUES. TO DETERMINE THE MERIDIONAL FLOW FROM THE SURFACE TO A DEPTH OF ABOUT 40 MM ON TIME SCALES OF DAYS AND MONTHS, WE WILL USE RINGDIAGRAM ANALYSIS WITH THREE TILE SIZES. TO DISCERN THE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ACTIVE REGIONS, WE WILL STUDY FLOWS FROM SMALL 5 DEGREE TILES. TO REACH DEPTHS OF ABOUT 40 MM AND STUDY THE INFLUENCE OF THE NEAR-SURFACE SHEAR LAYER, WE WILL USE FLOWS FROM 30 DEGREE TILES. WE WILL CROSS-VALIDATE THESE RESULTS WITH THOSE FROM THE STANDARD 15 DEGREE TILES COVERING DEPTHS FROM THE SURFACE TO ABOUT 16 MM. TO DETERMINE THE MERIDIONAL FLOW IN THE LOWER HALF OF THE CONVECTION ZONE ON TIME SCALES OF TWO YEARS, WE WILL USE A CUSTOMIZED TIMEDISTANCE ANALYSIS. THE KEY POINT IS TO PERFORM THE ANALYSIS IN SPHERICAL GEOMETRY, WHICH ALLOWS US TO ISOLATE ACOUSTIC WAVES PROPAGATING TO DEEP LAYERS. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO CONSTRAIN THE RETURN FLOW NEAR THE BASE OF THE CONVECTION ZONE AND THE NUMBER OF CELLS WITH DEPTH. WE WILL USE AN ENSEMBLE KALMAN FILTER TO ASSIMILATE THE SUBSURFACE MERIDIONAL FLOW AND THE SURFACE MAGNETOGRAMS INTO THE DYNAMO MODEL AND OPERATE THE MODEL IN THE ANALYSES AND THE FORECAST MODE, SO THAT WE CAN RESOLVE UNCERTAINTIES IN MODEL INGREDIENTS IN THE ANALYSES PHASE AND CORRECTLY HINDCAST AND FORECAST THE POLAR FIELDS AND PROPERTIES OF SOLAR CYCLES 24 AND 25 IN THE FORECAST PHASE. WE WILL CHECK THE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE MERIDIONAL FLOWS DETERMINED IN THE UPPER AND LOWER CONVECTION ZONE ON DIFFERENT TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL SCALES, AS WELL AS WHETHER THE MODEL WORKS BEST WITH HIGH OR LOW MAGNETIC DIFFUSIVITY. WE WILL DETERMINE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERIDIONAL FLOW AT HIGH LATITUDES FOR THE POLEWARD FLUX TRANSPORT AND POLAR FIELD FEATURES, AND IN TURN FOR THE CYCLE 25 AMPLITUDE",,,,

NARROW-BAND FILTER-BASED MAGNETOGRAPHS TAKE SIMULTANEOUS  SNAPSHOTS  OF EXTENDED AREA OF SOLAR SURFACE, BUT REQUIRE TAKING MULTIPLE OBSERVATIONS WITH DIFFERENT WAVELENGTH OFFSET BETWEEN SEPARATE FRAMES. BOTH APPROACHES MAY REQUIRE RELATIVELY LARGE NUMBER OF OPTICAL AND ELECTRO-MECHANICAL ELEMENTS FOR SPECTRAL TUNING AND/OR SPATIAL SCANNING. THESE ADDITION ELEMENTS TEND TO INCREASE THE OVERALL WEIGHT AND SIZE OF INSTRUMENT, AND THE ADDED COMPLEXITY MIGHT AFFECT THE RELIABILITY OF SYSTEM. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: AS THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS PROJECT, WE WILL EXPLORE A NOVEL ALTERNATIVE TO THE STANDARD FILTER BASED MAGNETOGRAPH, WHICH WE CALL THE SIMPLEST MAGNETOGRAPH. THE PROPOSED INSTRUMENT CONCEPT IS BASED ON MEASURING A BROAD-BAND POLARIZATION OVER THE WHOLE LINE PROFILE, WHICH COULD BE DONE WITHOUT MOVING OPTICAL ELEMENTS AND COMPLICATED OPTICAL SCHEMES. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS CONCEPT WILL LEAD TO CREATION OF EXTREMELY SIMPLE AND COMPACT LINE-OF-SIGHT (LOS) OR FULL VECTOR MAGNETOGRAPH SUITABLE FOR SPACE MISSIONS. SUCH INSTRUMENT COULD BE ESPECIALLY ATTRACTIVE FOR SPACE WEATHER-ORIENTED MISSIONS. THE METHODOLOGY: THE CONCEPT OF THE PROPOSED MAGNETOGRAPH IS BASED ON A WELL-KNOWN FACT THAT ZEEMAN SPLIT SPECTRUM LINES IN A LINEOF- SIGHT (LOS) FIELD ARE ASYMMETRIC, WITH ONE OF THE V STOKES PROFILE LOBES STRONGER THAN THE OTHER IN A WAY THAT SWITCHES WITH POLARITY. IN TRANSVERSE FIELD, THERE IS A NET LINEAR POLARIZATION AVERAGED ACROSS THE LINE PROFILE BECAUSE THE CENTRAL PART OF THE SPECTRUM LINE IS SATURATED RELATIVE TO THE WINGS SO THE WING POLARIZATION DOMINATES IN Q AND U POLARIZATION PROFILES. THUS, MEASURING NET POLARIZATION OVER THE ENTIRE SPECTRAL LINE PROFILE (WITHOUT SCANNING IN SPECTRAL OR SPATIAL DIRECTIONS) ALLOWS TO DETERMINE BOTH POLARITY AND THE FIELD STRENGTH (MAGNETIC FLUX) FOR EACH PIXEL OF IMAGE. PRELIMINARY TESTS WITH STOKES-V SPECTRA TAKEN WITH GONG INSTRUMENT SUPPORT THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS APPROACH. PROPOSED CONTRIBUTION: THE NSO TEAM WILL INVESTIGATE THE CONCEPT OF THIS SIMPLEST MAGNETOGRAPH BOTH VIA MODELING AND LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS. WE WILL ALSO BUILD A PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT. THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS MAGNETOGRAPH WILL BE TESTED AT THE GROUNDBASED TELESCOPES OPERATED BY THE NSO. IN ADDITION, THE PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT CAN BE PROPOSED FOR FLIGHT ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AND PERHAPS ALSO ON MISSION OF OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS THE UK/EU LAGRANGE L5 MISSION.",,,,

THE EVOLUTION OF ACTIVE REGIONS IS OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE IN SOLAR PHYSICS. SINCE ACTIVE REGIONS ARE FORMED FROM STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS GENERATED BY A SOLAR DYNAMO LOCATED IN THE SOLAR INTERIOR, THEIR EVOLUTION FROM EMERGENCE THROUGH DECAY PROVIDES CRUCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE SOLAR DYNAMO AND THUS ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF THE SUN S ACTIVITY. SUBSURFACE FLOW PARAMETERS CAN SERVE AS PROXIES OF THE MAGNETIC STRUCTURE IN SUBSURFACE LAYERS AND LINK THE DYNAMICS OF SUBSURFACE LAYERS WITH THE CONDITIONS OF THE MAGNETIC ACTIVITY IN THE PHOTOSPHERE AND ABOVE. STUDIES OF SUBSURFACE FLOWS HAVE FOCUSED MAINLY ON FLARE-PRODUCTIVE REGIONS OR ON THE EMERGENCE OF ACTIVE REGIONS. HOWEVER, A SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF THE EVOLUTION OF SUBSURFACE FLOWS OF ACTIVE REGIONS FROM EMERGENCE TO DECAY WITH REGARD TO THEIR MORPHOLOGY HAS YET TO BE PERFORMED. ACTIVE REGIONS EVOLVE DURING THEIR LIFE TIME AND THE SUBSURFACE FLOWS ARE EXPECTED TO CHANGE AS WELL. WE PROPOSE TO STUDY THE SUBSURFACE FLOWS OF ACTIVE REGIONS OBSERVED BY SDO/HMI THROUGHOUT THE SOLAR CYCLE. WE WILL FOCUS ON, FOR EXAMPLE, LONG-LIVED ACTIVE REGIONS, EMERGING AND DECAYING REGIONS, FLARING AND NON-FLARING REGIONS, AND REGIONS WITH AND WITHOUT ROTATING SUNSPOTS. THE GOAL IS TO ESTABLISH COMMON FEATURES OF THE SUBSURFACE DYNAMICS OF ACTIVE REGIONS AND DIFFERENTIATE THEM FROM CHARACTERISTICS THAT DEPEND ON THEIR MORPHOLOGY. THE RESULTING FLOW PROFILES WILL PROVIDE CRUCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE MAGNETIC FLUX OF ACTIVE REGIONS AND HOW IT IS SYNTHESIZED, CONCENTRATED, AND DISPERSED.DATA: WE WILL USE DOPPLERGRAMS AND MAGNETOGRAMS OBTAINED BY THE HMI INSTRUMENT ONBOARD THE SDO SPACECRAFT. THESE HIGHRESOLUTION OBSERVATIONS ALLOW US TO MEASURE SUBSURFACE FLOWS AT GREAT DISTANCES FROM DISK CENTER AND THUS FOLLOW THE EVOLUTION OF ACTIVE REGIONS DURING THEIR DISK PASSAGE FOR A MUCH LONGER PERIOD OF TIME THAN POSSIBLE WITH PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS. THE AVAILABILITY OF SIMULTANEOUS VECTOR MAGNETOGRAMS WILL ALLOW US TO FOLLOW THE EVOLUTION OF ACTIVE REGIONS AT THE SOLAR SURFACE AND TO DERIVE SURFACE FLOWS AS WELL. METHODOLOGY: WE WILL PERFORM A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF THE SUBSURFACE AND SURFACE FLOWS OF ACTIVE REGIONS AND THEIR TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL EVOLUTION. WE WILL DERIVE THE SUBSURFACE FLOWS DURING THE DISK PASSAGE OF EACH ACTIVE REGION WITH RING-DIAGRAM AND TIMEDISTANCE ANALYSIS (TWO WELL-ESTABLISHED HELIOSEISMIC TECHNIQUES) OF HMI DOPPLERGRAMS. IN ADDITION TO USING FLOWS FROM THE HMI RING-DIAGRAM PIPELINE, WE WILL CUSTOMIZE THE TECHNIQUES TO DERIVE FLOWS ON A FINER TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL GRID APPROPRIATE FOR ACTIVE REGIONS. AT THE SURFACE, FLOWS AND EVOLUTION OF MAGNETIC ACTIVITY WILL BE DERIVED FROM THE CORRESPONDING HMI VECTOR MAGNETOGRAMS USING ESTABLISHED CORRELATION TRACKING TECHNIQUES TO DERIVE SURFACE FLOWS. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO MATCH THE SURFACE WITH THE SUBSURFACE EVOLUTION OF ACTIVE REGIONS. RELEVANCE: THE PROPOSED STUDY OF SUBSURFACE DYNAMICS OF ACTIVE REGIONS WILL LEAD TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE EVOLUTION OF ACTIVE REGIONS. THE PROPOSAL IS THUS RELEVANT TO THE FOLLOWING GOAL OF THE SDO PROJECT: HOW IS ACTIVE REGION MAGNETIC FLUX SYNTHESIZED, CONCENTRATED, AND DISPERSED ACROSS THE SOLAR SURFACE?

THIS WOULD BE A UNIQUE DATA SET FOR THE SOLAR PHYSICS COMMUNITY SINCE THE CONTINUOUS MDI OBSERVATIONS HAVE NEVER BEEN USED TO PRODUCE SUBSURFACE FLOWS USING RING-DIAGRAM (RD) TECHNIQUE. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO INFER SUBSURFACE HORIZONTAL FLOWS USING THE RING-DIAGRAM TECHNIQUE, ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL TOOLS OF LOCAL HELIOSEISMIC ANALYSIS. THIS METHOD HAS BEEN WIDELY USED TO MEASURE THE FLOWS USING HIGH-RESOLUTION DOPPLERGRAMS FROM GONG, MDI AND HMI. HOWEVER FOR RING ANALYSIS, THE OBSERVATIONS FROM MDI HAVE BEEN SUITABLE ONLY DURING THE \DYNAMICS PROGRAM\"" WHICH NORMALLY OCCURRED ABOUT 2 MONTHS IN A YEAR. DUE TO TELEMETRY LIMITATIONS, THE DATA FROM OTHER PERIODS WERE DOWN-SAMPLED, TRUNCATED AT OUTER SOLAR LIMB AND DOWNLOADED IN LOWER RESOLUTION WHICH IS NOT SUITABLE FOR STANDARD RING ANALYSIS. AS A RESULT, RD ANALYSIS USING MDI DATA CAN BE CARRIED OUT INFREQUENTLY ONLY DURING THE 2-MONTH PERIOD IN A YEAR ALTHOUGH MDI OBSERVATIONS ARE AVAILABLE CONTINUOUSLY OVER A PERIOD OF 15 YEARS COVERING TWO MINIMUM AND ONE MAXIMUM PERIODS OF SOLAR ACTIVITY. THUS, OUR AIM IS TO USE THE CONTINUOUSLY AVAILABLE LOW-TELEMETRY MDI DATA FROM THE LOW-ACTIVITY PERIOD BEFORE CYCLE 23 THROUGH THE RISING PHASE OF CYCLE 24.

USE OF THIS SH TIME SERIES HAS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES FIRST, IT HAS BEEN GENERATED FROM THE CORRECTED VELOCITY IMAGES (DISTORTION, APODIZATION ETC.), AND SECONDLY, A SMOOTH TRANSITION NEAR THE SURFACE LAYERS CAN BE PERFORMED BY APPLYING SPECIFIC FILTERS TO THE SH TIME SERIES IN SPHERICAL GEOMETRY. RECONSTRUCTION OF VELOCITY IMAGES USING THE SH COEFFICIENT TIME SERIES (INVERSE SH DECOMPOSITION) WILL BE CARRIED OUT WITH THE EXISTING TIME-DISTANCE PIPELINE DEVELOPED BY US AT NATIONAL SOLAR OBSERVATORY. THIS PIPELINE IS WELL TESTED AND VALIDATED BY MEASURING DEEP MERIDIONAL FLOW PROPERTIES. THESE BIG RING PATCHES (30 DEGREE IN DIAMETER AS OPPOSED TO 15 DEGREE PATCHES USED IN THE STANDARD RING DIAGRAM) WILL BE SUBSEQUENTLY USED TO INFER SUBSURFACE FLOW TO A DEPTH OF 30 MM BY PERFORMING CUSTOM RING ANALYSIS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT, OUR DATA PRODUCT, THE MERIDIONAL FLOW AND ITS TEMPORAL VARIATIONS AT DIFFERENT DEPTHS OVER 15 YEARS WILL PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT DATA SET TO COMPARE WITH MEASUREMENTS OBTAINED FROM THE TIME-DISTANCE TECHNIQUE. AVAILABILITY OF THIS DATA PRODUCT WILL ALLOW INTERESTED RESEARCH TEAMS TO INVESTIGATE SOLAR CYCLE AND LONG-TERM VARIATIONS OF FLOWS AND DYNAMICS OF THE UPPER CONVECTION ZONE OVER THE WHOLE MDI TIME EPOCH IN CONTRAST TO THOSE AVAILABLE OVER A LIMITED PERIOD OF ONLY TWO MONTHS A YEAR. IN SUMMARY, WE PLAN TO GENERATE NEW DATA PRODUCTS FROM THE CONTINUOUS MDI OBSERVATIONS SPANNING A PERIOD OF ABOUT 15 YEARS. THESE PRODUCTS INCLUDE: (I) ZONAL AND MERIDIONAL FLOWS AS A FUNCTION OF THE LATITUDE, DEPTH AND TIME, (II) CUSTOM DATA CUBES IN AND AROUND WELL-KNOWN LARGE ACTIVE REGIONS FOR BETTER INVESTIGATION OF FLOW PATTERN AROUND THEM, AND (III) RECONSTRUCTED DOPPLERGRAMS FOR THE ENTIRE DURATION OF MDI OBSERVATIONS.

TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, WE WILL FOCUS ON SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE LARGE-SCALE FLOWS NEAR LOCATIONS OF ACTIVITY, INCLUDING ACTIVITY COMPLEXES AND ACTIVE LONGITUDES, AND SEARCH FOR SUBSURFACE MARKERS OR EVEN PRECURSORS OF MAGNETIC ACTIVITY. SECOND, WE WILL FOCUS ON FLOWS AT MID- TO HIGH LATITUDES WHERE DIFFUSING FLUX IS BEING TRANSPORTED POLEWARD. THIRD, WE WILL FOCUS ON THE SOLAR-CYCLE VARIATION OF FLOWS DERIVED FROM LOCATIONS OF HIGH OR LOW ACTIVITY AND THE NORTH-SOUTH ASYMMETRY IN MAGNETIC ACTIVITY AND ITS CONNECTION TO SUBSURFACE FLOWS AND WHETHER THESE FLOWS ARE PRECURSORS OF THE NEXT-CYCLE ACTIVITY. WE WILL STUDY THE FLOWS IN THREE DEPTH RANGES: THE LAYERS CLOSE TO THE SURFACE, WHERE THE DENSITY CHANGES BY SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE, THE NEAR-SURFACE SHEAR LAYER (NSSL, AT ABOUT 35 MM), WHERE THE ROTATION RATE SHOWS A LOCAL MAXIMUM, AND THE LAYERS IN BETWEEN THESE TWO. THE FLOWS IN THESE LAYERS HAVE THE MOST DIRECT INFLUENCE ON SURFACE ACTIVITY. METHODOLOGY: WE WILL PERFORM A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF THE LARGE-SCALE HORIZONTAL FLOWS (ZONAL AND MERIDIONAL FLOWS) FROM THE SURFACE TO A DEPTH OF ABOUT 40 MM (94% SOLAR RADIUS) FROM THE EQUATOR TO 70 DEGREE LATITUDE OR HIGHER. WE WILL FOCUS ON THEIR VARIATION WITH LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, AND TIME. WE WILL STUDY THE VARIATION FROM ONE ROTATION TO THE NEXT AND DURING THE COURSE OF A SOLAR CYCLE. TO DERIVE THE SUBSURFACE FLOW COMPONENTS, WE WILL APPLY RING-DIAGRAM ANALYSIS (A WELL-ESTABLISHED HELIOSEISMIC TECHNIQUE) TO SDO/ HMI DOPPLERGRAMS. AS A STARTING POINT, WE WILL USE THE FLOW VALUES DERIVED FROM THE STANDARD HMI RING-DIAGRAM PIPELINE WITH THREE DIFFERENT TILE SIZES. WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY STUDIED THE SUBSURFACE FLOWS IN THE NEAR-SURFACE LAYERS (TO A DEPTH OF 16 MM) WITH VELOCITIES FROM THE HMI 15-DEGREE RING-DIAGRAM PIPELINE. FOR THE PROPOSED STUDY, WE WILL, IN ADDITION, USE TILES AS SMALL AS 5 DEGREES FOR A BETTER SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION NEAR THE SURFACE AND BIG TILES OF 30 DEGREE TO COVER THE NSSL. WE WILL THEN CUSTOMIZE THE RING-DIAGRAM ANALYSIS MODIFYING THE GRID SIZE AS WELL AS THE GRID SPACING AND THE TRACKING RATE TO OPTIMIZE THE ANALYSIS FOR THE PROPOSED PROJECT. WE WILL DERIVE THE SYSTEMATIC VARIATIONS OF THE FLOWS WITH DISK POSITION AND CORRECT THEM. TO DERIVE THE FLOWS NEAR THE NSSL, WE WILL ALSO APPLY HELIOSEISMIC TIME-DISTANCE ANALYSIS TO SDO/HMI DOPPLERGRAMS. SINCE TIMEDISTANCE AND RING-DIAGRAM ANALYSES HAVE DIFFERENT ERROR CHARACTERISTICS, THIS WILL ALLOW US TO CROSS-VALIDATE THE RESULTS FROM BOTH TECHNIQUES. TO DERIVE FLOWS AT THE SOLAR SURFACE, WE WILL USE F-MODES DERIVED FROM SDO/HMI DOPPLERGRAMS AND AN APPROPRIATE LCT TECHNIQUE APPLIED TO SDO/HMI DOPPLERGRAMS AND VECTOR MAGNETOGRAMS. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO COMPARE THREE SETS OF SURFACE FLOWS FROM DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES AND DATA SETS. PROPOSED CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FOCUS TEAM EFFORT: THE PROPOSED STUDY OF THE LARGE-SCALE FLOWS IN THE UPPER CONVECTION ZONE WILL PROVIDE OBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS, WHICH WILL BE CRUCIAL FOR THE MODELING OF THE SOLAR INTERIOR AND THE SOLAR FLUX TRANSPORT. THIS WILL LEAD TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE GENERATION AND EVOLUTION OF GLOBAL-SCALE MAGNETIC FIELDS AND, AS A CONSEQUENCE, PROVIDE CONSTRAINTS FOR FORECASTING SOLAR ACTIVITY. THE PROPOSED STUDY THEREFORE ADDRESSES THE OBJECTIVE OF FOCUSED SCIENCE TOPIC (4): UNDERSTANDING GLOBAL-SCALE SOLAR PROCESSES AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SOLAR INTERIOR.",,,,

MEASURING THE ENERGETICS OF OUTFLOWS IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR NASA''S SCIENCE OBJECTIVE OF UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECT OF ENERGETIC PROCESSES AROUND SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLES ON THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT IN GALAXIES, CLUSTERS AND THE INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM. THEREFORE, THE MOST IMPORTANT GOALS IN THE STUDY OF THESE OUTFLOWS ARE TO MEASURE THEIR MASS FLUX, KINETIC LUMINOSITY, AND CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES IN ORDER TO ASSESS THEIR IMPORTANCE TO AGN FEEDBACK ON THEIR ENVIRONMENT. THE BROAD RANGE OF REDSHIFTS AND THE ACCESS TO SHORT REST WAVELENGTHS MADE POSSIBLE BY FAR ULTRAVIOLET SPECTROSCOPIC EXPLORER (FUSE) OBSERVATIONS OF AGN OPENS A VAST DISCOVERY SPACE USING THE MANY MORE DIAGNOSTIC LINES (COMPARED TO LONGER WAVELENGTHS) IN THE 500-1050 A RANGE (REST WAVELENGTHS) THAT SHOW UP AS ABSORPTION TROUGHS IN AGN OUTFLOWS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR THE DENSITY-SENSITIVE EXCITED-STATE TRANSITIONS OF HIGHLY IONIZED ELEMENTS (E.G., OIV* 790) THAT CAN YIELD THE DISTANCE OF THE OUTFLOWS FROM THE CENTRAL SOURCE, AND THE INCREASINGLY HIGHER IONIZATION SPECIES (O VI, NE VIII, NA IX AND MG X) THAT SUPPLY THE CRUCIAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE UV AND XRAY (SO-CALLED WARM ABSORBERS) MANIFESTATION OF AGN OUTFLOWS.

OUR PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF THE FUSE ARCHIVE REVEALS DOZENS OF AGN WITH APPROPRIATE CHARACTERISTICS FOR US TO CARRY OUT OUR PROPOSED PROGRAM OF STUDY. MANY OF THE BEST OBJECTS ALSO HAVE HST SPECTRA AVAILABLE, AND WE WILL USE THESE DATA TO PROVIDE COMPLEMENTARY MEASUREMENTS OF ABSORPTION LINES AT LONGER WAVELENGTHS. FOR THOSE OBJECTS WITH AVAILABLE X-RAY OBSERVATIONS, WE WILL ALSO USE THOSE DATA TO HELP UNDERSTAND THE FULL RANGE OF IONIZATION STATES IN THE ABSORBING GAS. OUR WORK WILL INVOLVE FIVE STEPS TO OBTAINING REAL MEASUREMENTS OF THE MASS FLUX, KINETIC LUMINOSITY, AND THE ABUNDANCES IN A LARGE SAMPLE OF AGN: 1. WE WILL MEASURING RELIABLE IONIC COLUMN DENSITIES FROM THE OBSERVED ABSORPTION TROUGHS, USING THE HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTRA TO OVERCOME THE EFFECTS OF NON-BLACK SATURATION. 2. WE WILL USE PHOTOIONIZATION MODELS TO MEASURE THE IONIZATION STATE AND TOTAL OUTFLOWING COLUMN DENSITY, FACILITATED BY OUR MEASUREMENTS OF ABSORPTION IN MULTIPLE IONIC STATES IN THE FUSE (AND HST) SPECTRA. 3. WE WILL DETERMINE THE CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES, INCLUDING RELATIVE ABUNDANCES FROM THE PHOTOIONIZATION MODELS, AND ABSOLUTE ABUNDANCES (I.E., RELATIVE TO HYDROGEN) SINCE WITH FUSE (TOGETHER WITH HST WHEN AVAILABLE) WE MEASURE SEVERAL LINES IN THE LYMAN SERIES, ALLOWING FOR AN ACCURATE DETERMINATION OF HI. 4. WE WILL DETERMINE THE DISTANCE OF THE OUTFLOW FROM THE CENTRAL SOURCE BY MEASURING THE NUMBER DENSITY (N_H) VIA TROUGHS FROM METASTABLE LEVELS AND USING THE N_H AND IONIZATION PARAMETER (U) TO SOLVE FOR THE DISTANCE OF THE ABSORBING GAS. 5. WE WILL CONSTRAIN THE FRACTION OF SOLID ANGLE SUBTENDED BY THE OUTFLOW FROM THE CENTRAL CONTINUUM SOURCE BY USING THE FRACTION OF OUTFLOWS DETECTED IN OUR LARGE SAMPLE AS A PROXY FOR THE GLOBAL COVERING FRACTION.

FLARES ARE OFTEN SEEN AS A TUMULTUOUS BREAKUP OF A PREVIOUSLY STABLE CONFIGURATION LEADING TO RELEASE OF A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ENERGY, MATERIAL ERUPTION, PARTICLE ACCELERATION, AND RESTRUCTURING OF MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION. THIS MAGNETIC RESTRUCTURING MAY BE A KEY FOR UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSICS OF PROCESSES TAKING PLACE THROUGHOUT THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE IN RESPONSE TO FLARES: MAGNETIC FIELD SUPPLIES ENERGY TO FLARES, AND SERVES AS A TRIGGER AND AS A CONDUIT OF ENERGY TRANSPORT. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO INVESTIGATE THE MAGNETIC RESTRUCTURING ASSOCIATED WITH FLARES AND ITS EFFECTS ON THERMODYNAMIC PROCESSES IN THE LOW SOLAR ATMOSPHERE. THE CHANGES IN THE MAGNETIC FIELD WILL BE EVALUATED IN RESPECT TO TWO ALTERNATIVE MODELS: CORONAL IMPLOSION AND TWIST REMOVAL MODEL. EITHER OF THESE SCENARIOS MAY TAKE PLACE IN FLARES, BUT THE TWO MODELS CAN BE DISTINGUISHED BASED ON EXPECTED MAGNETIC FIELD CHANGES. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS BASED ON FULL VECTOR MAGNETIC FIELD DATA FROM TWO NASA MISSIONS, SDO AND HINODE, AND SUPPLEMENTED WITH OBSERVATIONS FROM TWO GROUND-BASED INSTRUMENTS, GONG (LINE-OF-SIGHT ONLY) AND SOLIS (VECTOR DATA). THESE TWO AUXILIARY DATA SETS WILL ENHANCE THE INTERPRETATION OF SDO DATA, STRENGTHEN THE STATISTICS. THE AUXILIARY DATA SETS COULD BE CRITICAL IN FINDING THE PROPER INTERPRETATION IN CASES WHEN THE MAGNETIC FIELD DERIVATIONS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE POOR SPECTRAL RESOLUTION OF HMI, OR HAMPERED BY THE POOR TEMPORAL CADENCE OF SOT/SP. THESE DATA SETS WILL ALSO ALLOW INCLUDING FLARES PRIOR TO SDO LAUNCH FOR GREATER STATISTICAL SAMPLE, IF NEEDED. SOLIS CA II 854.2 NM LINE-OF-SIGHT (LOS) MAGNETOGRAMS WILL EXPAND THE STUDY TO THE CHROMOSPHERE. USING SDO VECTOR MAGNETOGRAMS WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE CHANGES IN ORIENTATION AND STRENGTH OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD AND THE ASSOCIATED CHANGES IN LORENTZ FORCE. FOR SELECTED CASES, WE WILL ALSO DERIVE PSEUDO-VECTOR FIELDS USING HIGH-CADENCE SDO/HMI AND GONG LINE-OF-SIGHT (LOS) MAGNETOGRAMS BASED ON THE APPROACH OF AZIMUTHAL AVERAGING. EVOLUTION OF THE DERIVED PSEUDO-VECTOR FIELDS DURING FLARES WILL BE INVESTIGATED AND VALIDATED WITH THE RESULT FROM SDO/HMI VECTOR MAGNETOGRAMS. TO INVESTIGATE CHANGES IN THERMODYNAMIC PARAMETERS ASSOCIATED WITH FLARES, WE WILL USE EXISTING OBSERVATIONS OF FLARING REGIONS WITH THE STOKES POLARIMETER ON HINODE. IN ADDITION, WE WILL USE EXISTING FLARE OBSERVATIONS WITH SOLIS FOR A FEW SELECTED FLARES AND CONDUCT NEW OBSERVATIONS IF NEEDED. AS A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT, SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL SOLIS OBSERVATIONAL FLARE CAMPAIGNS WERE CONDUCTED IN THE PAST. THE USE OF SOLIS DATA WILL ENHANCE THE INTERPRETATION OF SDO/HMI SPECTRAL DATA AS SOLIS/VSM HAS HIGHER SPECTRAL SAMPLING AS COMPARED WITH SDO/HMI DATA. CHANGES IN THERMODYNAMIC PARAMETERS WILL SHOW THE EFFECT OF FLARES THROUGH THE FORMATION HEIGHT RANGE OF THE FE I 630.1-630.2 NM PHOTOSPHERIC AND CA I 854.2 NM CHROMOSPHERIC SPECTRAL LINES. FINALLY, WE WILL COMPARE THE LOCATION OF FOOTPOINTS OF FLARE LOOPS DERIVED FROM RHESSI OBSERVATIONS IN AN ENERGY RANGE OF 50-300 KEV WITH THE LOCATIONS THAT SHOW SIGNIFICANT TOPOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE MAGNETIC FIELD. WE WILL EXAMINE THE RATE OF FLUX LOSS IN THE RECONNECTION EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH FLARES.

IN SUMMARY OF ONE IMPORTANT APPLICATION, THE K2 DATA SET FOR M67 WOULD BE AN INDISPENSIBLE FIRST STEP TOWARDS THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE CONDITIONS OF THE HABITABLE ZONES IN SUN LIKE STARS AT SOLAR AGE. FINALLY, TRANSITS OF SUPER EARTHS AND LARGER EXOPLANETS COULD BE DETECTED.

A KEY OBSERVATIONAL CHALLENGE OF THE NEXT DECADE WILL BE TO UNDERSTAND THE LINKS BETWEEN THE FORMATION OF PLANETS IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS AND THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF EXOPLANETS. POTENTIALLY HABITABLE PLANETS IN PARTICULAR ARE LIKELY FORMED BY SOLIDS GROWING WITHIN RADII OF A FEW AU, AUGMENTED BY UNKNOWN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM VOLATILES FORMED AT LARGER RADII OF 10-50 AU. THE BASIC CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THESE INNER DISK REGIONS IS CHARACTERIZED BY NEAR- TO FAR-INFRARED (2-200 MICRON) EMISSION LINES FROM MOLECULAR GAS AT TEMPERATURES OF 50-1500 K. A CRITICAL STEP TOWARD MEASURING THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF PLANET-FORMING REGIONS IS THEREFORE TO CONVERT OBSERVED INFRARED MOLECULAR LINE FLUXES, PROFILES AND IMAGES TO GAS TEMPERATURES, DENSITIES AND MOLECULAR ABUNDANCES. HOWEVER, CURRENT TECHNIQUES TYPICALLY EMPLOY APPROXIMATE RADIATIVE TRANSFER METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS OF LOCAL THERMODYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM (LTE) TO RETRIEVE ABUNDANCES, LEADING TO UNCERTAINTIES OF ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE AND INCONCLUSIVE COMPARISONS TO CHEMICAL MODELS. ULTIMATELY, THE SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF THE HIGH QUALITY SPECTROSCOPIC DATA EXPECTED FROM THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE (JWST) WILL BE LIMITED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF RADIATIVE TRANSFER TOOLS FOR INFRARED MOLECULAR LINES. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A NUMERICALLY ACCURATE, NON-LTE 3D LINE RADIATIVE TRANSFER CODE, NEEDED TO INTERPRET MID-INFRARED MOLECULAR LINE OBSERVATIONS OF PROTOPLANETARY AND DEBRIS DISKS IN PREPARATION FOR THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE (JWST). THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY ADDING CRITICAL FUNCTIONALITY TO THE EXISTING MONTE CARLO CODE LIME, WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED TO SUPPORT (SUB)MILLIMETER INTERFEROMETRIC OBSERVATIONS. IN CONTRAST TO EXISTING INFRARED CODES, LIME CALCULATES THE EXACT STATISTICAL BALANCE OF ARBITRARY COLLECTIONS OF MOLECULAR LINES, AND DOES NOT USE LARGE VELOCITY GRADIENT (LVG) OR ESCAPE PROBABILITY APPROXIMATIONS. HOWEVER, TO USE LIME FOR INFRARED LINE RADIATIVE TRANSFER, NEW FUNCTIONALITY MUST BE ADDED AND TESTED, SUCH AS DUST SCATTERING, UV FLUORESCENCE, AND INTERFACES WITH PUBLIC STATE-OF-THE ART 3D DUST RADIATIVE TRANSFER CODES (E.G., RADMC3D) AND THERMO-CHEMICAL CODES (E.G, PRODIMO). INFRARED TRANSITIONS OF MOLECULES EXPECTED TO BE UBIQUITOUS IN JWST SPECTRA CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE GOOD DATABASES APPLICABLE TO ASTROPHYSICAL MODELING AND PROTOPLANETARY DISKS, INCLUDING WATER, OH, CO2, NH3, CH4, HCN, ETC. OBTAINING ACCURATE SOLUTIONS OF THE NON-LTE LINE TRANSFER PROBLEM IN 3D IN THE INFRARED IS COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE. WE PROPOSE TO BENCHMARK THE NEW CODE RELATIVE TO EXISTING, APPROXIMATE METHODS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY ARE ACCURATE, AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. WE WILL ALSO CREATE CONVERSION TABLES BETWEEN MID-INFRARED LINE STRENGTHS OF WATER, OH, CH4, NH3, CH3OH, CO2 AND OTHER SPECIES EXPECTED TO BE OBSERVED WITH JWST, AND THEIR RELATIVE ABUNDANCES IN PLANET-FORMING REGIONS.

POSSIBLE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN HOST-STAR CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS MASS OR CHEMICAL COMPOSITION, AND THE UNDERLYING NATURE OF DAUGHTER PLANETARY SYSTEMS, SUCH AS MASSES OR EVEN ORBITAL ARCHITECTURES, WILL BE EXTENDED TO THE REGIME OF THE M-DWARFS.

THIS ONE METER TELESCOPE WILL CREATE A MONUMENTAL CHANGE IN FAINT NEA OBSERVATIONS, BECOMING THE LARGEST FULL TIME NEOO TELESCOPE IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE DEDICATED TO THE RECOVERY OF V23.0-24.0 MAGNITUDE NEOS. UTILIZING THIS ONE METER TELESCOPE FOR V23RD NEA RECOVERY WILL PROVIDE LONGER ORBITAL ARCS ON NEWLY DISCOVERED ASTEROIDS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO RECOVER V23RD MAGNITUDE SINGLE OPPOSITION NEAS. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL: 1) PRODUCE 2,000, V23RD MAGNITUDE MEASURES PER YEAR DURING DARK TIME AND, 2) PROVIDE A LARGE APERTURE TELESCOPE TO RECOVER FAINT NEOCP OBJECTS AND NEWLY DISCOVERED NEAS DURING FULL MOON. NEA FOLLOW-UP IS CRITICAL TO THE REDUCTION OF ORBITAL UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE FOLLOW-UP TELESCOPES UTILIZING BOTH NON-SIDEREAL TRACKING AND VECTOR CO-ADDING TECHNIQUES CAN OBSERVE ASTEROIDS MUCH FAINTER THAN THE DISCOVERY TELESCOPES IN DRIFT SCAN. THE ASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE HAS PERFECTED THIS TECHNIQUE ALLOWING 0.61-M TELESCOPES AT CTIO TO OBSERVE ASTEROIDS AS FAINT AS V23.0 WITH A 30 MINUTE VECTOR CO-ADDED IMAGE. THIS SAME TECHNIQUE WILL ALLOW CTIO S 1.0-M TO OBSERVE ASTEROIDS AS FAINT AS V24.0. APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY: CTIO S ONE METER CASSEGRAIN REFLECTOR BUILT BY BOLLER AND CHIVENS IN 1965 HAS BEEN OPERATIONAL AT CTIO SINCE 1974. THE TELESCOPE WILL BE AUTOMATED USING DAN GRAY S SIDEREAL TECHNOLOGIES HARDWARE AND WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE SKYNET REMOTELY OPERATED TELESCOPE NETWORK. CTIO S ONE METER TELESCOPE WILL BE CONTROLLED ALONGSIDE THE EXISTING NASA FUNDED PROMPT TELESCOPES ALLOWING A SINGLE OPERATOR TO MANAGE ALL OPERATIONS. THIS OBSERVING METHOD IS THE MOST COST EFFICIENT BECAUSE THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ASTEROID TARGETING, DATA REDUCTION, AND DATA TRANSFER ARE ALREADY FULLY AUTOMATED. UTILIZING A SINGLE TELESCOPE OPERATOR TO HANDLE ALL OF SSNEO S OPERATIONS MAXIMIZES THESE ASSETS PREVENTING DUPLICATION OF OBSERVATIONS AS WELL AS BETTER CONTROL OF THE TELESCOPE SYSTEM RELATIVE TO WEATHER PATTERNS. CTIO S 1.0-M TELESCOPE WILL CONCENTRATE ALL DARK OBSERVING TIME TO RECOVERY OF V23.0-24.0 MAGNITUDE NEOS AND NEAR FULL MOON WILL ASSIST IN FAINT NEOCP AND NEWLY DISCOVERED OBJECTS TO PREVENT THOSE NEAS FROM BECOMING LOST. SIGNIFICANCE OF PROPOSED WORK: AT THE FIRST AND SECOND IAWN COMMITTEE MEETING, T. SPAHR REPORTED THAT DEDICATED GROUND BASED TELESCOPE FOLLOW-UP TO #tilde#V24 WAS NEEDED, ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE. THE CTIO 1.0-M TELESCOPE WILL BE THE FIRST TELESCOPE TO PROVIDE THAT CAPABILITY ON A FULLTIME BASIS. CURRENTLY THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII 2.24-M TELESCOPE OPERATED BY D. THOLEN HAS PROVIDED THE MAJORITY OF FOLLOW-UP AND RECOVERY OBSERVATIONS FAINTER THAN V23.0. HOWEVER, ONLY A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME EACH YEAR IS DEDICATED TO THOSE OBSERVATIONS. FROM 2015 OCTOBER 1ST THROUGH 2016 MARCH 1ST THERE WERE 4,540 MEASURES FAINTER THAN 22ND MAGNITUDE REPORTED TO THE MINOR PLANET CENTER AND ONLY 476 FAINTER THAN V23.0. CTIO S 1.0-M TELESCOPE WILL PRODUCE #tilde#2,000, V23.0-V24.0 MEASURES PER YEAR RESULTING IN A 300% INCREASE IN THESE FAINT NEO OBSERVATIONS.",,,,

SCIENTIFIC: THE SOUTHERN SKY NEAR EARTH OBSERVATIONS (SSNEO) BEGAN APRIL 1ST, 2012 AND HAS SINCE PROVIDED OVER 80% OF ALL NEA MEASURES BELOW MINUS 20 DECLINATION. THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE REMAINS A CRITICAL AREA FOR NEA FOLLOW-UP TO PREVENT MANY ASTEROIDS FROM BEING LOST BY EXTENDING THEIR ORBITAL ARCS. WITH THE INCREASE IN NEA DISCOVERIES FROM PANSTARRS AND THE CATALINA SKY SURVEY (CSS) THE NUMBER OF NEAR-EARTH OBJECT CONFIRMATION PAGE (NEOCP) NEAS IN NEED OF ASTROMETRY HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER. THEREFORE, SSNEO IN PHASE 3 WILL DEDICATE THEIR EFFORTS TO PROVIDE AN EFFICIENT NEA ASTROMETRY AND RECOVERY PROGRAM. PANSTARRS AND CSS ARE CURRENTLY EXPENDING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF TIME CONDUCTING FOLLOW-UP OF THEIR OWN DISCOVERIES LIMITING THEIR ABILITY TO SEARCH FOR NEW NEAR-EARTH ASTEROIDS. IN PHASE 3 SSNEO WILL DECREASE THE NEED FOR SURVEYS TO FOLLOW-UP THEIR SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE TARGETS BY 25%. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY UTILIZING NEW HARDWARE AND A SCHEDULING SYSTEM WHICH WILL OBTAIN EPHEMERIS AND UNCERTAINTY INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM JPL S NEASCOUT WEBSITE. TECHNICAL: IN 2015, SSNEO EXPANDED THEIR PROJECT FROM ONE 0.41-M TELESCOPE TO TWO 0.61-M TELESCOPES AND ONE 0.41-M INSTRUMENT INCREASING THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE FOLLOW-UP OF NEOS TO MAGNITUDE V23.0. THIS PROPOSAL WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE THREE TELESCOPES AND WILL REQUEST FUNDS TO UPGRADE THE REMAINING 0.41-M TELESCOPE TO A 0.61-M INSTRUMENT. WITH THIS UPGRADE ALL THREE TELESCOPES WILL BE IDENTICAL WITH THE SAME IMAGE SCALE AND 23.9 ARC-MINUTE FIELD OF VIEW. SINGLE OPPOSITION NEAS TYPICALLY HAVE AN UNCERTAINTY WHICH IS LINEAR WITHIN A RANGE OF RIGHT ASCENSION AND DECLINATION. TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF RECOVERIES THE THREE TELESCOPES WILL HAVE A NEW FEATURE WHERE EACH TELESCOPE S CAMERA ROTATOR WILL AUTOMATICALLY ORIENT ITS POSITION SO THAT THE SKY ANGLE OF UNCERTAINTY ALIGNS WITH THE CCD S ARRAY DIAGONALLY. BECAUSE EACH TELESCOPE HAS A DIAGONAL IMAGE THAT IS 33.8 ARC-MINUTES, ALL THREE TELESCOPES TOGETHER CAN COVER 5,100 ARC-SECONDS OF UNCERTAINTY WORKING TOGETHER. THIS ADDITIONAL FEATURE IN TELESCOPE AUTOMATION TAKES ADVANTAGE OF EACH TELESCOPE''S IDENTICAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, A 3 SQUARE DEGREE UNCERTAINTY REGION CAN BE EASILY SEARCHED IN A SINGLE NIGHT. THE JPL NEASCOUT WEBSITE IS A NEW ASSET THAT WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO DAILY OPERATIONS. USING NEASCOUT BOTH NEOCP AND NEA S EPHEMERIS AND UNCERTAINTY OF AN OBJECT CAN BE DIRECTLY LINKED INTO SSNEO S AUTOMATION ROUTINES. THIS WILL ALLOW CALCULATIONS OF THE FIELDS TO BE TARGETED SO THE UNCERTAINTY AREA CAN BE EASILY SEARCHED. MANAGEMENT: FOLLOW-UP OBSERVATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE ASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE S SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE CONTROL OFFICE. ARI HAS SIX YEARS OF EXPERIENCE CONTROLLING TELESCOPES AT CTIO REMOTELY. THIS GRANT WILL CONTINUE TO BE MANAGED BY PI ROBERT HOLMES AND CO-I TYLER LINDER. CO-I LINDER WILL MANAGE THE DAILY OPERATIONS AND OVERSEE PROPER AUTOMATION ROUTINES PROVIDING IMPORTANT SUPPORT TO PANSTARRS AND CSS DISCOVERIES AS WELL AS EXTENDING THE ORBITAL ARCS ON AS MANY SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE TARGETS AS POSSIBLE.",,,,

UTILIZING FOUR TELESCOPES LOCATED AT THE INSTITUTE, OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO PROVIDE THE LONGEST POSSIBLE ORBITAL ELEMENTS SPECIFICALLY FOR OBJECTS FAINTER THAN MAGNITUDE 22.0. THE PRINCIPAL GOAL OF THIS FACILITY IN PHASE IV WILL BE TO MEASURE MORE THAN 2,000 NEAS THAT ARE FAINTER THAN 22ND MAGNITUDE, IN ORDER TO MAKE THEIR FUTURE RECOVERY MUCH MORE PROBABLE DURING THE OBJECTS NEXT OPPOSITION.APPROACH AND METHODOLOGYARI WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON NEO CONFIRMATION PAGE OBJECTS AS A MAJOR PRIORITY. OUR SECONDARY GOAL IN THIS RESEARCH WILL BE TO CONDUCT FOLLOW UP OBSERVATIONS OF FIRST OPPOSITION NEOS AND THOSE REQUIRING ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS AS SPECIFIED BY THE MINOR PLANET CENTER MPC. ARIS LOWEST PRIORITY IN PHASE IV WILL BE TARGETED FOLLOW UP OF MULTIOPPOSITION OBJECTS.AS THE LARGE SKY SURVEYS SUCH AS PANSTARRS AND THE MT. LEMMON SURVEY CONTINUE TO MAKE NEW DISCOVERIES OF OBJECTS FAINTER THAN 22ND MAGNITUDE, THE NEED FOR FAINT FOLLOW UP BECOMES MORE IMPERATIVE. DURING PHASE IV, ARI PLANS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS ON NEAS BRIGHTER THAN 22ND MAGNITUDE DUE TO THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE OBSERVERS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON THESE NEOS. IN 2015, ONLY SIX OBSERVATORIES REPORTED MORE THAN 250, 22ND MAGNITUDE MEASURES OF NEOS TO THE MPC. OF THESE SIX, ARI WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR 47.5 OF ALL THE OBSERVATIONS THAT WERE FAINTER THAN MAGNITUDE 22.0. IN 2015, H21 CONFIRMED 513 NEOS FOR THE SKY SURVEY DISCOVERY TEAMS AND RECOVERED TWENTY FIVE 22ND MAGNITUDE FIRST OPPOSITION OBJECTS. THREE OF THE FOUR INSTRUMENTS CURRENTLY IN OPERATION AT THE INSTITUTE ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF 22ND MAGNITUDE NEO OBSERVATIONS AND THE 1.3 M TELESCOPE IS CAPABLE OF RECOVERING 23RD MAGNITUDE NEOS. SHORTLY AFTER COMMISSIONING THE 1.3 M TELESCOPE IN SEPTEMBER 2014, NEO 2010 SV3 WAS RECOVERED AT UNFILTERED MAGNITUDE 24.2 WITH THREE MEASURES. THREE WEEKS LATER IT WAS CONFIRMED A SECOND TIME WITH THREE ADDITIONAL MEASURES. DURING THIS TELESCOPES FIRST 18 MONTHS OF OPERATION MORE THAN 105, 23RD MAGNITUDE NEOS HAVE BEEN MEASURED.SIGNIFICANCE OF PROPOSED WORKOBSERVATIONS IN PHASE IV WILL BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN ONLY A FEW FOLLOW UP FACILITIES ARE AVAILABLE DUE TO THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S. ANNUAL MONSOON SEASON. IN 2015 THE INSTITUTE AT WESTFIELD, ILLINOIS WORKED 63 NIGHTS DURING THE SUMMER PRODUCING 10,202 NEO MEASURES AND CONFIRMING 170 NEWLY DISCOVERED OBJECTS FOR THE DISCOVERY TEAMS. IN ADDITION, H21 RECOVERED 163 NEOS THAT SUMMER FAINTER THAN MAGNITUDE 22.0.IN AN EFFORT TO STEP UP FAINT OBSERVATIONS, ARO WILL CLEARLY IMPACT NASAS NEO PROGRAM BY TARGETING AN ESTIMATED 2,000 NEAS FAINTER THAN MAGNITUDE 22.0 EACH YEAR.

THE RESEARCH QUESTION BEHIND COSMOQUEST S CREATION WAS SIMPLE: IF STUDENTS AND THE PUBLIC ARE PROVIDED A PROPERLY SCAFFOLDED EXPERIENCE THAT MIRRORS THAT OF RESEARCHERS, WILL THEY COME? AND CAN THEY RISE UP TO BE RESEARCH COLLABORATORS? IN CREATING COSMOQUEST, WE STARTED WITH A CORE OF CITIZEN SCIENCE PORTALS, EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS FOR BOTH STUDENTS AND LIFELONG LEARNERS, AND COLLABORATION AREAS. THESE THREE PRIMARY FOCUSES MIRROR THE RESEARCH, COURSES, AND COLLABORATION SPACES THAT FORM THE FOUNDATION OF A UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENT. WE THEN WENT ON TO ADD THE FEATURES THAT MAKE A CENTER STANDOUT   WE ADDED SEMINARS IN THE FORM OF GOOGLE HANGOUTS ON AIR, PLANETARIUM CONTENT THROUGH OUR SCIENCE ON THE HALF SPHERE PROGRAM, AND EVEN THE CHANCE TO VICARIOUSLY ATTEND CONFERENCES THROUGH LIVE BLOGGING BY OUR TEAM MEMBERS. WITH THIS DESIGN FOR A VIRTUAL RESEARCH FACILITY, THE ANSWER TO OUR FOUNDATIONAL QUESTION HAS BEEN A RESOUNDING YES; THE PUBLIC CAN AID US IN DOING SCIENCE, WHILE WE ALSO IMPROVE U.S. SCIENTIFIC LITERACY.",,,,

RRTMGP, WHICH IS BEING DEVELOPED UNDER CURRENT SUPPORT FROM THE NASA MAP PROGRAM, IS A HIGH- PERFORMANCE RADIATION CODE DESIGNED FOR THE CURRENT GENERATION OF COMPUTATIONAL ARCHITECTURES. THE CODE IS A COMPLETELY RESTRUCTURED AND MODERN VERSION OF THE RRTMG RADIATION CODE USED IN MANY GCMS. RRTMGP PRESERVES THE STRENGTHS OF THE EXISTING RRTMG PARAMETERIZATION, ESPECIALLY THE HIGH ACCURACY OF THE K-DISTRIBUTION TREATMENT OF ABSORPTION BY GASES, BUT THE ENTIRE CODE HAS BEEN REWRITTEN TO PROVIDE HIGHLY EFFICIENT COMPUTATION ACROSS A RANGE OF ARCHITECTURES.

FOOTPRINTS (SURFACE INFLUENCE FUNCTIONS) FOR OVER 5 MILLION GROUND-BASED, AIRBORNE, AND SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS HAVE BEEN COMPUTED AND MADE FREELY AVAILABLE TO THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY. HERE WE PROPOSE TO: (1) ESTIMATE NORTH AMERICAN FLUXES USING THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF OCO-2 DATA BY EXTENDING THE CT-LAGRANGE FOOTPRINT LIBRARY, (2) INVESTIGATE ERRORS IN ESTIMATED FLUXES, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO ERRORS IN SIMULATED ATMOSPHERIC TRANSPORT BY LEVERAGING INDEPENDENT DATA AND MODELING ACTIVITIES FROM THE NASA ATMOSPHERIC CARBON AND TRANSPORT   AMERICA (ACT-AMERICA) AND (3) CONDUCT A SET OF CONTINENTAL-SCALE OBSERVATION SYSTEM SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS IN PREPARATION FOR ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM THE NEWLY ANNOUNCED GEOSTATIONARY CARBON CYCLE OBSERVATORY (GEOCARB) MISSION. OUR PROJECT WILL MAKE EXTENSIVE USE OF NASA ASSETS, INCLUDING OCO-2 AND TCCON XCO-2, AND SOLAR-INDUCED CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE RETRIEVALS FROM OCO-2 AND ESA S GOME-2. WE WILL ALSO USE AND EVALUATE NASA MODEL PRODUCTS (E.G., MERRA TRANSPORT FIELDS AND CMS FLUX PRODUCTS), THUS STRENGTHENING LINKS BETWEEN CMS AND NOAA S CARBONTRACKER EFFORT AND SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTEGRATED CARBON MONITORING SYSTEM. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL FURTHER DEVELOP STRATEGIES FOR INCORPORATING DIVERSE CO2 OBSERVATIONS INTO CMS FLUX PRODUCTS AND FOR QUANTIFYING FLUXES AND THEIR UNCERTAINTIES AT SCALES RELEVANT FOR UNDERSTANDING CARBON CYCLE PROCESSES AND FOR MONITORING, REPORTING AND VERIFICATION (MRV).",,,,

NH3 CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO PARTICULATE MATTER (PM) THROUGH THE FORMATION OF AMMONIUM SALTS, CONTRIBUTING TO CARDIOVASCULAR AND RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES WORLDWIDE. NH3 ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO NITROGEN DEPOSITION; FLOW OF EXCESS NITROGEN IS ONE OF THE LARGEST THREATS TO BIOSPHERE INTEGRITY. AGRICULTURE IS THE LARGEST GLOBAL SOURCE OF NH3, AND BUT THERE ARE ALSO APPRECIABLE EMISSIONS OF NH3 FROM BIOMASS BURNING. HOWEVER, MAJOR UNCERTAINTIES EXIST IN NH3 EMISSION RATES FROM ALL SOURCES, AND ON ALL SCALES. THIS IS DUE TO SPARSE QUALITY IN SITU MEASUREMENTS. MEASUREMENTS FROM SATELLITE INSTRUMENTS PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR CAPTURING THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF NH3, ESPECIALLY OUTSIDE EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA, WHERE MONITORING NETWORKS RANGE FROM LIMITED TO NON-EXISTENT. THE NASA TROPOSPHERIC EMISSION SPECTROMETER (TES) WAS THE FIRST SATELLITE INSTRUMENT TO MEASURE NH3 FROM SPACE; TES CAPTURED SEASONAL VARIABILITY OVER LARGE REGIONS, AND DETECTED􀁊HOT SPOTS􀁊 OVER INDIA AND CHINA. TES ALSO REVEALED NH3 EMISSIONS FROM BIOMASS BURNING IN SOUTH AMERICA AND AFRICA, WHICH WERE ALSO OBSERVED BY THE METOP INFRARED ATMOSPHERIC SOUNDER INSTRUMENT (IASI) INSTRUMENT. NEW NH3 OBSERVATIONS FROM THE SNPP CROSS-TRACK INFRARED SOUNDER (CRIS) HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF NH3 DISTRIBUTIONS AND EMISSIONS BECAUSE CRIS HAS LOWER NOISE THAN IASI (0.04 K) AND SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER SPATIAL COVERAGE THAN TES. WHILE CRIS NH3 IS NOT YET AN OFFICIAL NASA PRODUCT, THE ALGORITHM WILL BECOME AN OPERATIONAL PRODUCT IN 2018. IT HAS ALREADY BEEN USED TO OBTAIN NH3 OVER CANADA, CALIFORNIA AND THE SOUTHEASTERN US, AS WELL AS OVER A NUMBER OF AERONET SITES. THESE DATA ARE CURRENTLY BEING VALIDATED AGAINST GROUND BASED FTIR AND AIRCRAFT NH3 MEASUREMENTS, AND HAVE PROVIDED INFORMATION ON THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF NH3 OVER THESE REGIONS. WE PROPOSE TO REFINE THE ALGORITHM WITH SOME CONTINUED VALIDATION AND TO DEMONSTRATE THE UTILITY OF THE CRIS NH3 DATA BY APPLYING SOME NOVEL APPROACHES TO OBTAIN EMISSION ESTIMATES AND SOURCE LOCATIONS. WE WILL: A) USE A TESSELLATION TECHNIQUE TO EXTRACT SUB-PIXEL INFORMATION FROM REPEATED CRIS OVERPASSES. THIS WILL PROVIDE MORE PRECISE LOCATIONS OF SOURCES OF HIGH NH3 EMISSIONS. B) USE AN IMAGE ROTATION APPROACH BASED ON PREVAILING WIND DIRECTION TO CREATE COMPOSITE IMAGES OF REGIONS WITH FIRES, CONFINED ANIMAL FEEDLOT OPERATIONS (CAFOS), OR OTHER INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE, AS WELL OVER SELECTED LARGE URBAN AREAS (LOS ANGELES). THESE IMAGES CAN BE USED TO COMPUTE NH3 FLUX DENSITY FROM THE AREAS OF INTEREST, WHICH CAN THEN BE USED TO ESTIMATE EMISSIONS. C) CARRY OUT A VALIDATION EXERCISE USING IN SITU MEASUREMENTS OF NH3 MADE WITH AN AERODYNE MODEL TILDAS C LASER SYSTEM ONBOARD THE NSF/NCAR C-130 DURING THE SUMMER 2018 WE-CAN (WESTERN WILDFIRE EXPERIMENT FOR CLOUD CHEMISTRY, AEROSOL ABSORPTION AND NITROGEN) CAMPAIGN, WHICH WILL COMPLEMENT ONGOING EFFORTS UNDER EXISTING NASA CONTRACTS; THE RESULTS WILL BE USED TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CRIS NH3 ALGORITHM OVER SMOKE SCENES. D) UPDATE EMISSION INVENTORIES WITH THE INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM CRIS, THEN COMPARE GEOS-CHEM MODEL OUTPUT WITH DATA OBTAINED FROM AIRCRAFT CAMPAIGNS (DISCOVER-AQ, FRAPPE, WE-CAN) AND SURFACE MEASUREMEMTS (AMON).

AIR QUALITY MANAGERS HAVE INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON CONTROLLING THE GROWING EMISSIONS OF NH3 AS A POTENTIAL STRATEGY TO REDUCE THESE HEALTH IMPACTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE LATEST EPA REGULATORY GUIDANCE ON ASSESSING THE IMPACTS OF NEW SOURCES OF PM2.5 PRECURSORS REQUIRES THAT EMISSIONS OF NH3 BE ADDRESSED. HOWEVER, CURRENT NH3 EMISSION INVENTORIES ARE TOO UNCERTAIN TO PROVIDE CREDIBLE ESTIMATES OF THE ASSOCIATED HEALTH IMPACTS.

HERE, WE PROPOSE TO QUANTIFY URBAN BIOGENIC CO2 FLUXES IN THE LOS ANGELES (LA) BASIN FOR A TOTAL OF 3 YEARS TO DISENTANGLE ANTHROPOGENIC VS BIOGENIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO URBAN CARBON CYCLING AND ATMOSPHERIC CO2 ENHANCEMENTS. A PRIMARY OUTCOME WILL BE A GENERALIZED MODEL-OBSERVATION FRAMEWORK TO STUDY GLOBAL URBAN CO2 SOURCE AND SINK PROCESSES, DRIVEN BY REMOTE SENSING OBSERVATIONS OF SOLAR INDUCED CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE (SIF) FROM NASA OCO-2, OCO-3, AND GEOCARB MISSIONS. OUR STRATEGY LEVERAGES THE DENSE SIF REMOTE SENSING OBSERVING NETWORK IN LA TO CONSTRAIN DIURNAL, SPATIAL AND SEASONAL VARIABILITY IN PHOTOSYNTHETIC ACTIVITY ACROSS DIVERSE URBAN AND NATURAL LANDSCAPES IN LA, AND FEEDS THIS INFORMATION INTO A NEW URBAN LIGHT USE EFFICIENCY MODEL, THE URBAN VEGETATION PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND RESPIRATION MODEL (URBANVPRM), TO ESTIMATE GROSS AND NET BIOSPHERE CO2 FLUX. SIF OBSERVATIONS FROM OCO-2 AND EXPECTED FROM OCO-3 WILL PROVIDE SMALL FOOTPRINT (3 KM2) AND HIGH DATA ACQUISITION NEEDED TO RESOLVE LANDSCAPE SCALE PROCESSES, WITH OCO-3 PROVIDING THE ADDED BENEFIT OF HIGH RESOLUTION SPATIAL MAPPING AND DIURNAL ACQUISITION OVER CITIES SIMILAR TO EXPECTED GEOCARB MAPPING ABILITIES. TO OPTIMIZE INFORMATION CONTENT OF OCO-2 AND OCO-3, WE WILL USE DIURNALLY INTEGRATED AND SPATIALLY EXPLICIT HYPERSPECTRAL MEASUREMENTS FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABORATORY FOR ATMOSPHERIC REMOTE SENSING FOURIER TRANSFORM SPECTROMETER (CLARS-FTS) ON MT WILSON (SITTING ABOVE LA) TO CALIBRATE AND SCALE OCO-2/OCO-3 SIF OVERPASSES ACROSS THE LA BASIN, TO BETTER CHARACTERIZE SATELLITE DERIVED DAILY INTEGRATED SIF VARIABILITY ACROSS DIVERSE NATURAL AND URBAN ECOSYSTEMS.

OBJECTIVE 2: QUANTIFY URBAN BIOGENIC CO2 FLUXES OVER THE LA MEGACITY, AND RANK URBAN VEGETATION TYPES IN TERMS OF ABILITY TO STORE CARBON AND MITIGATE ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS IN COMPARISON TO FOSSIL FUEL INVENTORIES. OBJECTIVE 3: VALIDATE AND ATTRIBUTE DOMINATE FOSSIL FUEL AND BIOGENIC CO2 FLUXES AGAINST TOWER IN SITU CO2 AND 14CO2 DATA. THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE A TIMELY FRAMEWORK TO INGEST THE LARGER SET OF ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS OBSERVATIONS (GEDI, HISUI, AND ECOSTRESS) EXPECTED FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION STARTING IN 2018, AND AN IMPORTANT TEST CASE TO INGEST HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION SIF DATA FROM GEOCARB IN LEVEL 3 AND 4 MODEL ENHANCED C PRODUCTS.

SMALL ASTEROIDS ARE USUALLY IRREGULARLY SHAPED, AND THE TOTAL FORCE INDUCES A TORQUE ON THEM AND THUS CHANGES THEIR SPIN CONDITIONS. THIS EFFECT, A SO-CALLED YORP EFFECT, IS ONE OF THE CRITICAL ELEMENTS THAT HAVE GENERATED THE CURRENTLY OBSERVED POPULATION OF ASTEROIDS IN THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE YORP EFFECT CAN SPIN THESE ASTEROIDS UP TO THEIR SPIN LIMITS AND CHANGE THEIR SHAPE CONFIGURATIONS. BECAUSE THE YORP EFFECT IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE SHAPES AND MATERIAL CONDITIONS, SUCH DEFORMATION PROCESSES MAY CAUSE THE YORP EFFECT TO BEHAVE STOCHASTICALLY [COTTO-FIGUEROA ET AL., APJ 2015]. HOWEVER, RECENT WORKS POINTED OUT THAT DETAILED ANALYSES WOULD BE ABLE TO REMOVE THE STOCHASTIC TREND OF THE YORP EFFECT AND PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DYNAMICAL AND STRUCTURAL EVOLUTION OF SMALL ASTEROIDS [E.G., MCMAHON, DPS 2017]. IN THIS PROJECT, WE QUANTIFY THE EVOLUTION OF THE YORP-DRIVEN ROTATIONAL ACCELERATION AND SHAPE DEFORMATION OF IRREGULARLY SHAPED ASTEROIDS. WE APPROACH THIS ISSUE BY USING A PLASTIC FINITE ELEMENT MODEL (FEM) TECHNIQUE, A SOFT-SPHERE DISCRETE ELEMENT METHOD (SSDEM), AND A YORP-COEFFICIENT COMPUTATION TECHNIQUE. TO QUANTIFY DETAILED INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE YORP EFFECT AND SHAPE DEFORMATION, WE WILL APPLY AN EFFICIENT SCHEME IN WHICH THE MEMBERS CAN WORK SEPARATELY. THIS PROJECT WILL USE TWO KEY PHYSICAL PARAMETERS THAT DESCRIBE COHESION OF GEOLOGICAL MATERIALS AND SURFACE MODIFICATION TO CHARACTERIZE THE YORP-DRIVEN SPIN-UP. USING FOUR PUBLICLY AVAILABLE POLYHEDRON SHAPE MODELS, WE ANALYZE THEIR REALISTIC EVOLUTION PROCESSES TO PROVIDE A QUANTITATIVE FRAMEWORK AND CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE YORP EVOLUTION OF SMALL ASTEROIDS.

AURORAL EMISSION FROM ELECTRON IMPACT PROCESSES CAN PROVIDE A REMOTE WINDOW ON THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF PLASMA AND NEUTRAL GASES SURROUNDING SMALL BODIES (GALAND&CHAKRABARTI, 2002; ROTH ET AL. 2014). SURPRISINGLY, ROSETTA FOUND THAT OUTSIDE 2 AU PRE-PERIHELION, ATOMIC AND MOLECULAR EMISSION FEATURES IN THE INNER COMA WERE PREDOMINANTLY CAUSED BY DISSOCIATIVE ELECTRON IMPACT EXCITATION (FELDMAN ET AL. 2015). WHEN THE COMET CAME WITHIN 2 AU OF THE SUN, FLUORESCENT EMISSION BECAME THE DOMINANT PROCESS, AS WATER DENSITIES IN THE INNER COMA COULD EFFECTIVELY COOL THE ELECTRON POPULATION BELOW THE THRESHOLD ENERGY OF THE RELEVANT ELECTRON IMPACT DISSOCIATIVE EXCITATION PROCESSES (BODEWITS ET AL. 2016). THE COMET WAS ALSO SUBJECTED TO SOLAR TRANSIENT EVENTS THAT INCREASED ATOMIC EMISSION FEATURES, A PROCESS WITH IMPLICATIONS ON THE CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE COMA THAT ARE NOT YET FULLY UNDERSTOOD (EDBERG ET AL. 2016, NOONAN ET AL. 2018). FURTHER QUANTITATIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE ALICE AND OSIRIS IMAGES OF THE COMA HAS BEEN HAMPERED BY LIMITED LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS OF EXCITATION CROSS SECTIONS FOR ELECTRON IMPACT REACTIONS WITH THE GASES PRESENT IN COMETARY COMAE. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE EMISSION OBSERVED BY ALICE AND OSIRIS, IT IS NECESSARY TO CORRELATE THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE NEUTRAL GAS AND ELECTRONS IN THE COMA. METHODOLOGY WE WILL COMBINE AND CORRELATE IN-SITU MEASUREMENTS OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ELECTRON POPULATION BY THE RPC INSTRUMENTS WITH THE TEMPERATURES OF WATER, WITH DETAILED EMISSION MAPS OF FRAGMENT SPECIES (OH, OH+, OI, CI ..) ACQUIRED BY ALICE AND OSIRIS. WHEN THE COMET APPROACHED THE SUN ITS PRODUCTION RATES (AND THUS LOCAL DENSITIES OF SPECIES) INCREASED BY TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDES, PROVIDING US WITH A WIDE SAMPLE OF PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS. FURTHERMORE, THE COMA EXPERIENCED MULTIPLE SHORT-LIVED EVENTS THAT PROVIDE NATURAL LABORATORIES TO STUDY PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROCESSES IN THE COMA, SUCH AS COMET OUTBURSTS (TEMPORAL ENHANCEMENT OF LOCAL DENSITY), CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS AND CO-ROTATING INTERACTION REGIONS (SOLAR WIND INTENSITY, ELECTRON DENSITY AND TEMPERATURE INCREASE), AND SOLAR FLARES (INCREASED HIGH ENERGY EMISSION FROM THE SUN). WE WILL USE THESE EVENTS AS NATURAL LABORATORIES TO STUDY HOW PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AFFECT THE COMPOSITION AND CHEMISTRY IN THE COMA. FINALLY, TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE EMISSION OF FRAGMENT SPECIES SEEN BY OSIRIS AND ALICE ARE RELATED TO THE PARENT MOLECULES (AS SEEN BY MIRO) WE WILL CONTINUE TO CONDUCT ELECTRON IMPACT EXPERIMENTS ON ABUNDANT COMA MOLECULES SUCH AS H2O, CO2, O2, AND CO IN THE LAB. RELEVANCE OUR PROPOSAL IS DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THE RDAP PROGRAM AS WE WILL ENHANCE THE SCIENTIFIC RETURN OF ROSETTA MISSION BY PLACING SEVERAL INSTRUMENTS  OBSERVATIONS AND DATASETS (MEASURED BRIGHTNESSES, ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS, AND DENSITIES) INTO CONTEXT WITH IDENTIFIED COMA PROCESSES.

AN ADDITIONAL CHALLENGE IS IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF APPROPRIATE SRM INSULATION MATERIALS THAT MEET THE THERMAL, MECHANICAL, AND RHEOLOGICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR EUROPA LANDER AND OTHER MISSIONS. IN PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED ADHESIVES THAT REDUCE BACILLUS SPORE VIABILITY THAT ARE COMMONLY USED IN SRM INSULATION ASSEMBLY. IN THIS PROPOSAL WE WILL COMBINE OUR COLLECTIVE EXPERTISE IN MICROBIOLOGY AND MATERIAL ENGINEERING TO IDENTIFY THE IDEAL COMBINATIONS OF ADDITIVES, ADHESIVES, POLYMERS AND INSULATION MATERIALS FOR USE IN THE EUROPA LANDER MISSION THAT COULD ALSO BE APPLICABLE TO OTHER DEEP-SPACE MISSIONS. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES: 1) DETERMINE THE REDUCTION IN BACILLUS SPECIES SPORE VIABILITY IN RESPONSE TO ADHESIVE FORMULATIONS APPLIED TO SRM CANDIDATE INSULATION MATERIALS. THESE STUDIES WILL INCLUDE MULTIPLE ADHESIVE FORMULATIONS ALREADY IN USE FOR SPACECRAFT ASSEMBLY, AND EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF SPORE INOCULUM, TIME OF EXPOSURE AND INSULATION COMPOSITION ON THE DEGREE OF BIOBURDEN REDUCTION THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED. WE WILL CONDUCT THESE ASSAYS USING STANDARD NASA PROTOCOLS, WITH FOUR DIFFERENT BACILLUS SPECIES ISOLATED FROM SPACECRAFT ASSEMBLY ENVIRONMENTS, AND WILL USE CRYOGRINDING TO PROCESS INSULATION MATERIALS PRIOR TO QUANTITATIVE DETERMINATION OF SPORE VIABILITY ON LABORATORY MEDIA. 2) EVALUATE BIOBURDEN ASSOCIATED WITH EUROPA LANDER MATERIALS. IN ADDITION TO SRM INSULATION, THERE ARE OTHER MATERIALS THAT MUST BE EVALUATED FOR THEIR INHERENT BIOBURDEN. IN CONSULTATION WITH SCIENTISTS AT MARSHALL SPACE FLIGHT CENTER AND THE JET PROPULSION LABORATORIES, OTHER MATERIALS ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN NEED OF EVALUATION FOR THEIR ASSOCIATED BIOBURDEN, IN PARTICULAR LINERS, O RINGS AND LUBRICANTS.

MONITORING BACILLUS SPECIES SPORE VIABILITY IS A CRITICAL INDICATOR OF BIOBURDEN REDUCTION, BUT OTHER ORGANISMS MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH EUROPA LANDER MATERIALS.

SHE ALSO PERFORMED IMAGE ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE INTERESTED SOURCE. SPECTRAL FITTING, TIMING ANALYSIS AND IMAGE ANALYSIS ON THE XMM-NEWTON DATASET WERE ALL COMPLETED SO FAR. AFURA MADE A POSTER PRESENTATION REPORTING HER ANALYSIS RESULTS ON THIS PROJECT AT THE #235 AAS IN HONOLULU, HAWAII, IN JANUARY 2020, WHICH IS GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR AN UNDERGRADUATE. WE HAVE A SIMULTANEOUS 150 KS NUSTAR OBSERVATION ON SGR B2 OBTAINED FROM A SEPARATE PROPOSAL. JOINT XMM AND NUSTAR ANALYSIS IS THE MOST POWERFUL TOOL FOR THIS ANALYSIS. THEREFORE, OUR TEAM ALSO REDUCED THE NUSTAR DATA, AND PERFORMED SPECTRAL AND IMAGING STUDY. BY FEBRUARY 2020, WE HAVE FINISHED JOINT ANALYSIS OF NUSTAR AND XMM-NEWTON DATA. BY COMPARING WITH ARCHIVAL DATA, WE CONCLUDE THAT AFTER TWO DECADES OF DECAYING, SGR B2 S X-RAY EMISSION PROBABLY HAS ENTERED A CONSTANT BASE LEVEL EMISSION STAGE, JUST AS WHAT WE PREDICTED IN THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL. THIS CONSTANT EMISSION LEVEL IS MOST LIKELY DUE TO LOW-ENERGY COSMIC-RAY CONTRIBUTION. THUS, WE CAN USE SGR B2 CLOUD AS A PROBE FOR MEV-GEV CHARGED PARTICLES IN THE GALACTIC CENTER. OUR NEXT STEP IS TO WRITE A PAPER REPORTING ALL OUR FINDINGS FOR THIS PROJECT, WITH A TITLE OF  FIRST CONSTRAINTS ON THE GALACTIC CENTER MEV-GEV COSMIC-RAYS USING REMAINING X-RAY EMISSION FROM SGR B2 . UNDERGRADUATES INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT WILL BE MAJOR AUTHORS FOR THIS PAPER. THE SCIENCE PI SHUO ZHANG HAD A TRANSITION TIME FROM A POSTDOC AT MIT TO AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT BARD COLLEGE. THEREFORE, THIS PROJECT HAS TO BE TRANSFERRED FROM MIT TO BARD COLLEGE. THE LAST PHRASE OF THE PROJECT WILL TAKE PLACE AT BARD COLLEGE. OUR PLAN IS TO FOCUS ON WRITING THE DRAFT DURING JUNE TO AUGUST 2020, AND SUBMIT THE PAPER TO THE ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL IN FALL 2020.

LONG TERM HUMAN MISSIONS REQUIRE SUSTAINED CREW HEALTH AND SAFETY. A RESEARCH AREA THAT IS IMPORTANT IN SUSTAINING CREW HEALTH IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF IMPROVED SPACEFLIGHT-SUITABLE METHODS FOR MICROBIOLOGICAL MONITORING, AS WELL AS CONTAMINATION CONTROL AND REDUCTION. THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS) IS A CONFINED AND ISOLATED HABITAT IN AN EXTREME, HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT. THE HUMAN AND HABITAT MICROFLORA VARIES IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ABOARD THE ISS. CHANGES IN THE MICROFLORA MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED HEALTH RISK FOR THE CREW. MICROORGANISMS INCLUDING MICROBIAL BIOFILMS HAVE BEEN FOUND ON VARIOUS HABITAT SURFACES, INSIDE THE AIR AND WATER HANDLING SYSTEMS AS WELL AS THE HARDWARE USED ON THE ISS. BIOFILMS ARE KNOWN TO CAUSE DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT FROM POLYMER DETERIORATION, METAL CORROSION AND BIO-FOULING. THE PRIMARY CONCERN REGARDING CREW HEALTH IS CHARACTERIZED BY ACTIVITY OF OPPORTUNISTIC PATHOGENIC MICROORGANISMS THAT HAVE BEEN NOTED TO ACCUMULATE IN THE CLOSED ENVIRONMENTS OF THE ISS AND OTHER SPACECRAFT ON LONG-DURATION MISSIONS. UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECTS OF THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT, ESPECIALLY ALTERED GRAVITY, ON MICROBIAL BIOFILMS IS CRUCIAL FOR THE SUCCESS OF LONG-TERM HUMAN SPACE MISSIONS. SURFACE-ASSOCIATED BIOFILM COMMUNITIES WERE ABUNDANT ON THE MIR SPACE STATION AND CONTINUE TO BE A CHALLENGE ON THE ISS. THE HEALTH AND SAFETY HAZARDS LINKED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIOFILMS ARE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN DUE TO THE SUPPRESSION OF HUMAN IMMUNE FUNCTION OBSERVED DURING SPACEFLIGHT. VARIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CERTAIN METALS REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CONTACT-MEDIATED MICROBIAL INFECTIONS. ANTIMICROBIAL SURFACES ARE DEFINED AS MATERIALS THAT CONTAIN AN ANTIMICROBIAL AGENT SUCH AS SILVER, COPPER AND THEIR ALLOYS THAT INHIBITS OR REDUCES THE ABILITY OF MICROORGANISMS TO GROW ON THE SURFACE OF A MATERIAL. ANTIMICROBIAL SURFACES ARE FUNCTIONALIZED IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PROCESSES. THE INTRODUCTION OF ANTIMICROBIAL SURFACES FOR MEDICAL, PHARMACEUTICAL AND INDUSTRIAL PURPOSES HAS SHOWN THEIR UNIQUE POTENTIAL FOR REDUCING AND PREVENTING MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION. THE CONTACT KILLING OF SEVERAL TYPES OF MICROORGANISMS BY COPPER HAS BEEN ASSESSED IN MULTIPLE LABORATORY INVITRO STUDIES. FOR SUSTAINED CREW HEALTH AND SAFETY ADDITIONAL STUDIES ON THE MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN THE FORMATION OF MICROBIAL BIOFILMS AND THEIR EFFICIENT DESTRUCTION UNDER SPACEFLIGHT CONDITIONS, I.E., LONG-TERM GROWTH AND ADAPTATION TO LOW GRAVITY ENVIRONMENTS, ARE NEEDED. THE HYPOTHESIS TO BE TESTED BY METALLICA IS THAT SURFACES CONTAINING COPPER AND/OR SILVER WILL INHIBIT BIOFILM FORMATION UNDER ALTERED GRAVITY REGIMES TO A LESSER EXTENT THAN IN 1 X G DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE INTERACTION WITH THE METAL IONS ON THE SURFACE IS SLOWER BECAUSE THEIR MOVEMENT AROUND THE CELL IS RESTRICTED TO DIFFUSION. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT AND THE RATE, IF ANY, OF COPPER AND/OR SILVER SURFACES ON MICROBIAL GROWTH RATE, TOTAL BIOMASS ACCUMULATION, AND BIOFILM FORMATION. THE GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A CONCEPTUAL MODEL DESCRIBING THE AFFECT OF MICRO-GRAVITY ON BIOFILM FORMATION GROWN ON NON-INHIBITING SURFACES AS WELL AS ON METAL SURFACES THAT ARE POTENTIAL BIOFILM GROWTH INHIBITORS. THE APPROACH WILL BE TO TEST THREE DIFFERENT MICROBIAL MODEL SYSTEMS (I.E., ESCHERICHIA COLI K12, A STAPHYLOCOCCUS SP. ISOLATE FROM THE ISS, AND THE HEAVY METAL RESISTANT STRAIN CUPRIAVIDUS METALLIDURANS CH34) FOR BIOFILM FORMATION ON VARIOUS COPPER- AND SILVER-SURFACES, AS WELL AS INERT SURFACES AS CONTROLS. THESE SURFACES DIFFER IN THEIR ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY BASED ON CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND/OR GEOMETRIC NANOSTRUCTURES. THESE SURFACES WILL BE TESTED FOR BIOFILM FORMATION RATES UNDER DIFFERENT SPACEFLIGHT RELEVANT GRAVITATIONAL REGIMES (E.G., MOON 0.16 X G, MARS 0.38 X G, G ISS AND 1 X G CONTROL).

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

THIS WILL PROVIDE A MORE GENERAL VIEW ON THE POSSIBLE EMERGENCE OF PREBIOTIC ENVIRONMENTS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. OUR TEAM HAS AN EXTENSIVE EXPERTISE IN THE CHEMISTRY, RADIATIVE TRANSFER, AND ATMOSPHERIC KINETIC PROCESSES RELEVANT TO THIS STUDY. OUR RECENT WORK HAS ANALYZED THE EMERGING ATMOSPHERES OF TERRESTRIAL PLANETS AFTER GIANT IMPACTS, USING A WELL-ESTABLISHED RADIATIVECONVECTIVE ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE CODE, WITH AN EXTENSIVE OPACITY DATABASE FOR ALL RELEVANT MOLECULES, AND THE CHEMISTRY SELF-CONSISTENTLY CALCULATED FOR VAPOR IN EQUILIBRIUM WITH A MAGMA OCEAN (LUPU ET AL. 2014). WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED THE CHEMISTRY CODE TO STUDY THE TRANSIENT IMPACT CHEMISTRY AND PHOTOCHEMISTRY, INCLUDING NEARLY ALL THE SMALL MOLECULES AND FREE RADICALS THAT CAN BE MADE FROM H, C, N, O, AND S. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ATMOSPHERIC CODE AND THE ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE CALCULATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED BY R. LUPU, S. VAHIDINIA AND M. MARLEY AT NASA AMES, AND BY T. ROBINSON AT UCSC. S. VAHIDINIA WILL ALSO PERFORM CALCULATIONS RELATED TO HAZE AND CLOUD AGGREGATE OPACITIES. R. FREEDMAN AT SETI INSTITUTE WILL ADVISE ON MOLECULAR OPACITY UPDATES.

DESPITE THIS, NO MAJOR STUDY OF EAST COAST US SNOWSTORMS HAS OCCURRED OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS. SINCE THAT LAST STUDY, THE CAPABILITIES OF REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES AND NUMERICAL WEATHER PREDICTION MODELS HAVE ADVANCED SIGNIFICANTLY, MAKING NOW AN IDEAL TIME TO CONDUCT A WELL-EQUIPPED SNOWSTORM STUDY TO IDENTIFY KEY PROCESSES AND IMPROVE REMOTE SENSING AND FORECASTING OF SNOWFALL. IMPACTS WILL FLY A COMPLEMENTARY SUITE OF REMOTE SENSING AND IN-SITU INSTRUMENTS FOR THREE 6-WEEK DEPLOYMENTS ON THE NASA S ER-2 AND P-3 AIRCRAFT. IMPACTS WILL ADDRESS THREE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES, PROVIDING OBSERVATIONS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS OF SNOWBAND FORMATION, ORGANIZATION, AND EVOLUTION. AT THE SAME TIME, IMPACTS WILL ALSO EXAMINE HOW THE MICROPHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND LIKELY GROWTH MECHANISMS OF SNOW PARTICLES VARY ACROSS SNOWBAND WHILE IMPROVING SNOWFALL REMOTE SENSING INTERPRETATION AND MODELING TO SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCE PREDICTIVE CAPABILITIES. THE BASE OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NASA P-3 IS PLANNED TO BE LOCATED AT NASA S WALLOPS FLIGHT FACILITY AND FOR THE ER-2, AT USAG HUNTER AAF, NEAR SAVANNA, GA. THIS PROPOSAL SETS OUT THE WORK AND BUDGET FOR THE BAER INSTITUTE PERSONNEL IN SUPPORTING THE IMPACTS MISSION. PERSONNEL FROM BAER INSTITUTE WILL PLAY INTEGRAL ROLES IN THE FIELD DEPLOYMENT MANAGEMENT (FDM) TEAM FROM NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTER S EARTH SCIENCE PROJECT OFFICE (ESPO). THE FDM TEAM WILL WORK WITH THE LEAD PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON TO MANAGE THE INVESTIGATION, IMPLEMENT THE FIELD DEPLOYMENTS AND COORDINATE RELEVANT ASPECTS OF PROGRAMMATIC REPORTING AT INVESTIGATION STATUS REVIEWS.",,,,

THE LACK OF INSIGHT INTO CHROMOSPHERIC ENERGETICS IS IN PART BECAUSE IT IS A HIGHLY DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPLEX REGION WITH VARIOUS PHYSICAL PROCESSES PLAYING AN IMPORTANT ROLE: RADIATIVE TRANSFER, SCATTERING, TIME DEPENDENT PARTIAL IONIZATION EFFECTS, ION-NEUTRAL INTERACTION EFFECTS (INIE), SUCH AS AMBIPOLAR DIFFUSION AND THE HALL TERM, AND THERMAL CONDUCTION ALONG THE MAGNETIC FIELD, WHICH IS IMPORTANT IN THE UPPER CHROMOSPHERE, TRANSITION REGION (TR), AND CORONA.

IN FACT, SURFACE RADIATIVE FLUX (SRF) ESTIMATIONS FROM SATELLITES (E.G. CERES) RELY HEAVILY ON MODELED FIELDS OF TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY, SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS AND CLOUDS.

KEPLER-78 B, COROT-7 B, KEPLER-10 B), AND THIS NUMBER IS EXPECTED TO GROW BY CONFIRMING ADDITIONAL PLANET CANDIDATES. THE CHARACTERIZATION OF PLANETS ON ULTRA-SHORT ORBITS IS ADVANTAGEOUS DUE TO THE LARGER NUMBER OF OBSERVABLE TRANSITS, AND THE LARGER TRANSIT SIGNAL IN THE CASE OF AN EVAPORATING ATMOSPHERE. MUCH ADVANCE HAS BEEN MADE IN UNDERSTANDING AND CHARACTERIZING HOT JUPITERS IN SIMILAR TRANSIT CONFIGURATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, NA HAS BEEN THE FIRST SPECIES TO BE DETECTED IN AN EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERE, BY OBSERVING THE EVAPORATING HOT-JUPITER HD209458B. UNDERSTANDING THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE MAGMA OUTGASSING AND VOLATILE LOSS WILL BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS PROJECT. OUR TEAM HAS THE EXPERTISE IN THE CHEMISTRY, RADIATIVE TRANSFER, AND ATMOSPHERIC ESCAPE MODELING AT THESE EXOTIC TEMPERATURES. OUR RECENT WORK HAS ANALYZED THE EMERGING ATMOSPHERES OF TERRESTRIAL PLANETS AFTER GIANT IMPACTS, USING A WELL-ESTABLISHED RADIATIVECONVECTIVE ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE CODE, WITH AN EXTENSIVE OPACITY DATABASE FOR ALL RELEVANT MOLECULES, AND THE CHEMISTRY SELF-CONSISTENTLY CALCULATED FOR CONTINENTAL CRUST AND BULK SILICATE EARTH COMPOSITIONS. WE WILL EXPAND ON THIS WORK BY CONSIDERING A WIDER RANGE OF CHEMICAL COMPOSITIONS, ASSESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF CLOUDS AND GENERATING CLOUDY MODELS, AND DEVELOPING DIS-EQUILIBRIUM MODELS BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT VERTICAL MIXING AND PHOTOCHEMISTRY. PHOTO-EVAPORATION WILL BE CONSIDERED IN THE ENERGY BALANCE BETWEEN HEATING, COOLING AND MASS LOSS. WE ALSO HAVE IN-HOUSE CODES TO GENERATE HIGH-RESOLUTION ECLIPSE SPECTRA AND PREDICT TRANSIT DEPTHS AND OBSERVABLE SIGNATURES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ATMOSPHERIC CODE, THE MOLECULAR OPACITY UPDATES, THE ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE CALCULATIONS AND THE HIGH RESOLUTION ECLIPSE SPECTRA WILL BE PERFORMED BY R. LUPU, M. MARLEY, AND R. FREEDMAN AT NASA AMES. THE ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY GRIDS WILL BE PROVIDED BY B. FEGLEY AND K. LODDERS AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY. THE TRANSIT SPECTRA AND OBSERVATIONAL FEATURES WILL BE COMPUTED BY J. FORTNEY AT UCSC, AND THE ATMOSPHERIC ESCAPE CALCULATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED BY K. ZAHNLE AT NASA AMES. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE FOLLOWING GOALS OF THE EXOPLANET RESEARCH PROGRAM: EXPLAIN OBSERVATIONS OF EXOPLANETARY SYSTEMS, AND UNDERSTAND THE CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROCESSES OF EXOPLANETS. OUR RESULTS WILL ALSO INFORM FUTURE JWST OBSERVATIONS.",,,,

COMMONLY, THE INTERPLANETARY TRANSPORT OF SEPS IS DESCRIBED BY A KINETIC, FOKKER-PLANCK (FP) TYPE OF EQUATION. HOWEVER, DUE TO ITS DIFFUSIVE NATURE IN THE PERPENDICULAR TRANSPORT, THIS APPROACH FALLS SHORT IN EXPLAINING THE FAST ACCESS OF PARTICLES TO A WIDE RANGE OF LONGITUDES. WE PROPOSE TO EXTEND THE ANALYSIS OF WIDESPREAD SEP EVENTS TO INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF FIELD-LINE WANDERING IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE RELEVANT TRANSPORT PROCESSES IN THESE EVENTS. SCIENCE QUESTIONS: IN THIS PROPOSAL WE AIM TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING SCIENCE QUESTIONS: (1) HOW ARE SEPS ABLE TO QUICKLY ACCESS LONGITUDINALLY WIDELY SEPARATED LOCATIONS IN THE INNER HELIOSPHERE? (2) WHICH ROLE DOES INTERPLANETARY TURBULENCE PLAY IN CROSS-FIELD TRANSPORT OF PARTICLES AND HOW DO SPATIAL VARIATIONS IMPACT ON PARTICLE DISTRIBUTIONS? (3) WHAT IS THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE NEAR-SUN INJECTION REGION OF SEPS VS. INTERPLANETARY TRANSPORT EFFECTS FOR THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF SEPS? (4) HOW ARE ELECTRON ENERGY SPECTRA SHAPED DURING THEIR TRANSPORT FROM COMPACT FLARING REGIONS TO 1AU? METHODS: A COMBINATION OF MODELING AND DATA ANALYSIS WILL HELP TO UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DIFFERENT TRANSPORT PROCESSES INVOLVED IN SEP PROPAGATION. WE WILL USE A NOVEL, RECENTLY DEVELOPED TRANSPORT MODEL WHICH INCLUDES PARTICLE MOTION ALONG FIELD LINES THAT MEANDER AS A RESULT OF PLASMA TURBULENCE. SUCH A NON-DIFFUSIVE PROPAGATION MODE CAN BE SHOWN TO DOMINATE THE SEP CROSS-FIELD PROPAGATION EARLY IN THE SEP EVENT HISTORY. WE WILL COMPARE THE NEW MODEL RESULTS TO THE STANDARD MODELING USING ONLY A FOKKER- PLANCK EQUATION WITH DIFFUSIVE PERPENDICULAR TRANSPORT, USING BOTH IDEALIZED SEP EVENTS AND A DATASET OF SEP OBSERVATIONS. THESE WILL INCLUDE IN-SITU ELECTRON AND ION OBSERVATIONS AND CONTEXTUAL REMOTE OBSERVATIONS OF THE SUN AND SOLAR ATMOSPHERE. RELEVANCE: STUDYING THE TRANSPORT PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH ENERGETIC PARTICLES ARRIVING AT EARTH ORBIT IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE FOR SPACE EXPLORATION, SINCE SEPS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE RADIATION LEVELS IN THE NEAR-EARTH ENVIRONMENT, POTENTIALLY DAMAGING TECHNOLOGICAL ASSETS AND IMPACTING ON THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF HUMANS IN SPACE. OUR PROPOSAL DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE SCIENCE GOALS OF THE STEREO MISSION (\UNDERSTAND HOW SEPS ARE DISTRIBUTED SO EFFICIENTLY AROUND THE SUN\"") AND THREE OF THE FOUR DECADAL SURVEY GOALS. THIS RESEARCH IS TIMELY DUE TO THE OBSERVATIONS OF WIDESPREAD SEP EVENTS BY STEREO AND THE UPCOMING SOLAR PROBE PLUS AND SOLAR ORBITER MISSIONS, WHICH WILL ADD FURTHER TO OUR OBSERVATIONAL BASIS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND ENERGETIC PARTICLE PROPAGATION IN THE INNER HELIOSPHERE.""",,,,

HOWEVER, EVEN AFTER DECADES OF SPACEFLIGHT MISSIONS, WE DO NOT KNOW IF MEDICATIONS ACT THE SAME IN THE SPACEFLIGHT ENVIRONMENT AS THEY DO ON EARTH. ASPECTS OF THE SPACEFLIGHT ENVIRONMENT (LOW GRAVITY, RADIATION EXPOSURE, CLOSED ENVIRONMENT, STRESS) HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO ALTER HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY. FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES, SOME OF THESE PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES COULD BE EXPECTED TO ALTER EITHER PHARMACOKINETICS (PK, HOW THE BODY ABSORBS, DISTRIBUTES, METABOLIZE AND EXCRETES ADMINISTERED MEDICATIONS) OR PHARMACODYNAMICS (PD, RECEPTORS OR SIGNALLING SYSTEMS THAT ARE THE TARGETS OF MEDICATION ACTION). ANECDOTAL DATA HAS SUGGESTED THAT, AT LEAST FOR CERTAIN MEDICATIONS OR INDICATIONS, INFLIGHT MEDICATION EFFICACY IS POOR, AND SPACEFLIGHT CREW USE HIGH DOSES, REPEATED DOSES, OR EVEN EXPERIENCE APPARENT TREATMENT FAILURES; FORTUNATELY NONE OF THESE EPISODES HAS BEEN SERIOUS ENOUGH TO CAUSE INJURY OR EVACUATION FROM LOW-EARTH ORBIT (LEO). HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO PREPARE FOR EXPLORATION MISSIONS WHERE SPEEDY EVACUATION TO EARTH MAY NOT BE A POSSIBILITY, THE LIKELIHOOD OF UNEXPECTED MEDICATION ACTION MUST BE DETERMINED. NEW STUDIES HAVE YIELDED THE FIRST DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE OF APPARENT TREATMENT FAILURES IN LOW EARTH ORBIT. THESE INSTANCES COULD BE EXPLAINED BY ALTERATIONS IN PK OR PD. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT THE SPACEFLIGHT ENVIRONMENT ALTERS HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY IN WAYS THAT AFFECT HOW MEDICATIONS ULTIMATELY EXERT THEIR ACTIONS, EITHER BY CHANGING PK OR PD. SPECIFICALLY, WE PROPOSE TO: (1) TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PK FOLLOWING ADMINISTRATION OF A MEDICATION IS DIFFERENT DURING SPACEFLIGHT AS COMPARED TO GROUNDBASED DATA FROM THE SAME SUBJECT, AND (2) TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT MEDICATION ACTION (PD) IS DIFFERENT DURING SPACEFLIGHT AS COMPARED TO GROUND-BASED DATA FROM THE SAME SUBJECT.

THE MEASUREMENT DATABASE CONSISTS OF O3 AND H2O MEASUREMENTS FROM MAUNA LOA, HAWAII, AND LAUDER, NEW ZEALAND; CLO MEASUREMENTS FROM MAUNA KEA, HAWAII AND SCOTT BASE, ANTARCTICA; AND H2O MEASUREMENTS FROM TABLE MOUNTAIN, CALIFORNIA. ALL THREE OF THESE SPECIES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE CLIMATE SYSTEM. OZONE MEASUREMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL TO MONITOR THE BEGINNING OF ITS RECOVERY, AND CLO MEASUREMENTS ARE NEEDED TO INTERPRET THIS PROCESS. WATER VAPOR IS THE RESERVOIR OF ODD HYDROGEN IN THE MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE, AND IS THEREFORE ALSO IMPORTANT TO OZONE CHEMISTRY. IT HAS ALSO BEEN SUGGESTED THAT VARIATIONS IN STRATOSPHERIC H2O HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON DECADAL-SCALE GLOBAL SURFACE CLIMATE CHANGE. TO ILLUSTRATE THE SCIENTIFIC VALUE OF THESE MEASUREMENTS WE DISCUSS SEVERAL STUDIES CONDUCTED DURING THE 2013-2017 PROPOSAL CYCLE WHICH MAKE USE OF THESE LONG-TERM DATASETS. THESE INCLUDED LONG-TERM TREND STUDIES OF CLO OVER MAUNA KEA [CONNOR ET AL., 2013], STUDIES OF H2O OVER BOTH MAUNA LOA AND TABLE MOUNTAIN [NEDOLUHA ET AL. 2013A; NEDOLUHA ET AL. 2013B], A STUDY OF DIURNAL O3 VARIATIONS OVER MAUNA LOA [PARRISH ET AL. 2014], AND STUDIES OF THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING ATMOSPHERIC DYNAMICS ON O3 [NEDOLUHA ET AL., 2015A; NEDOLUHA ET AL. 2015B]. IN ADDITION, A MANUSCRIPT RELATED TO LONG-TERM TRENDS IN CLO OVER SCOTT BASE HAS BEEN SUBMITTED [NEDOLUHA ET AL. 2016].

THE MOST IMPORTANT GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO MAINTAIN STABLE MEASUREMENTS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE ACCURATE DETECTION OF LONG-TERM CHANGE. IN ORDER TO ENSURE CONTINUED STABLE OPERATION INSTRUMENTS NEED TO BE UPDATED. THIS WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN THE INSTRUMENTS WITH CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY AND WILL REDUCE THE LONG-TERM MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS SO THAT WE CAN KEEP THEM OPERATING WITH A SINGLE FIELD ENGINEER AND SOME ON-SITE SUPPORT. THE H2O INSTRUMENTS UNDERWENT SIGNIFICANT UPDATES DURING THE 2009-2013 PROPOSAL CYCLE, AND HAVE REQUIRED MINIMAL TECHNICAL ATTENTION DURING THE 2013-2017 PROPOSAL CYCLE.

WHILE THE O3 INSTRUMENT HAS NOT YET UNDERGONE A FULL VALIDATION STUDY, SEVERAL MONTHS OF RETRIEVALS AND COMPARISONS WITH AURA MLS SUGGEST THAT IT IS OPERATING SATISFACTORILY. THERE ARE SEVERAL MAJOR TECHNICAL TASKS WHICH WE PLAN TO ACCOMPLISH IN THE 2017-2021 TIMEFRAME. WE PLAN TO REPLACE THE CRYOGENICALLY OPERATING O3 RECEIVERS AT MAUNA LOA AND LAUDER WITH ROOM TEMPERATURE VERSIONS, JUST AS HAS BEEN DONE FOR THE H2O SYSTEMS.

THIS IS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR ASTRONAUTS DURING AND AFTER LONG-DURATION SPACEFLIGHT, AS THEY MAY BE AT INCREASED RISK FOR REDUCED PERFORMANCE, BONE FRACTURES AND BOTH EARLY-ONSET OSTEOPOROSIS AND ARTHRITIS. ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY, VIA CENTRIPETAL ACCELERATION, IS A POSSIBLE APPROACH TO MITIGATE THESE DELETERIOUS CHANGES. YET, THE ABILITY OF PARTIAL GRAVITY INDUCED BY CENTRIPETAL ACCELERATION TO INHIBIT ADVERSE MUSCULOSKELETAL CHANGES IN SPACEFLIGHT REMAINS UNKNOWN. GIVEN THE CONSTRAINTS OF STUDYING CENTRIFUGATION AS A COUNTERMEASURE ON EARTH, SPACEFLIGHT-BASED STUDIES ARE NEEDED.

SEPARATE WORK HAS ALSO SHOWN THAT AFTER UNLOADING, AN ABRUPT MECHANICAL RELOADING TO 1G CAUSES ADDITIONAL MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURY. HERE, WE PROPOSE TO EMPLOY BOTH PWB AND HINDLIMB UNLOADING MODELS SEQUENTIALLY TO INVESTIGATE GRAVITY AS A CONTINUUM AND ITS IMPACT ON MUSCULOSKELETAL ADAPTATION TO RELOADING.

TO DETERMINE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ADAPTATIONS OF THE MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM IN MALES TO THE FRACTIONAL GRAVITY OF EITHER THE MOON OR MARS AFTER EXPERIENCING MICROGRAVITY IN TRANSIT. 2. TO DETERMINE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ADAPTATIONS OF THE MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM IN FEMALES TO THE FRACTIONAL GRAVITY OF EITHER THE MOON OR MARS AFTER EXPERIENCING MICROGRAVITY IN TRANSIT. 3.

SPECIFICALLY, WE PLAN TO INVESTIGATE THE RESULTING MUSCULOSKELETAL ALTERATIONS IN TRANSITIONING FROM 2 WEEKS OF 0G TO 0.2, 0.4, AND 0.7G, HYPOTHESIZING THAT THERE IS A DOSE-DEPENDENCE TO THE RELOADING, INCLUDING RECOVERY AND ASSOCIATED INJURY. WE WILL ALSO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF USING THESE THREE LEVELS OF PWB AS INTERMEDIATE STEPS ON THE WAY TO TRANSITIONING BACK TO 1G. THOROUGH POST MORTEM ANALYSES, WE WILL ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE DIFFERENT PROCESSES THAT MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN RELOADING INJURY AND ITS MITIGATION.

THUS, DESPITE RIGOROUS EXERCISE PROTOCOLS AND OTHER COUNTERMEASURES, MUSCLE ATROPHY AND BONE LOSS ARE STILL VIRTUALLY INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCES OF SPACEFLIGHT. ONE APPROACH FOR AMELIORATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE UNTOWARD CONSEQUENCES OF SPACE TRAVEL IS BY THE INDUCTION OF ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY DURING SPACEFLIGHT VIA CENTRIFUGATION. THE STRENGTH OF THE ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY DEPENDS BOTH ON THE SPEED OF ROTATION AND DIAMETER OF THE SHIP. WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE EQUIVALENT 1.0G, IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT LOWER LEVELS OF FORCE MAY ALSO BE EFFECTIVE FOR PREVENTING MUSCLE ATROPHY AND IRREVERSIBLE BONE LOSS. IN THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSE TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY FOR THE PREVENTION OF MUSCLE ATROPHY AND WEAKNESS AND BONE LOSS BY STUDYING RATS USING AN INNOVATIVE SYSTEM FOR PARTIAL UNLOADING THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED PREVIOUSLY FOR MICE BY MEMBERS OF OUR TEAM. WE WILL STUDY THE MUSCULOSKELETAL RESPONSE OF ADULT MALE RATS (N=L 4 I GROUP) FOLLOWING EXPOSURE TO DIFFERENT DEGREES OF UNLOADING REPRESENTING 0.2G, 0.4G, AND 0. 7G AS WELL AS FULLY LOADED ANIMALS FOR 1, 2 AND 4 WEEKS.

A FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE IS TO PREDICT WHETHER NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION (NETPP) IN THIS REGION WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE UNDER CHANGING NORTHERLY AND SOUTHERLY ADVECTIVE FLOWS. HERE, WE SUGGEST THAT THE BALANCE WILL DEPEND ON REGIONAL BOTTOM-UP DRIVERS (E.G., STRATIFICATION, NUTRIENT AND LIGHT AVAILABILITY, COMMUNITY COMPOSITION) AND TOP-DOWN DRIVERS (E.G., GRAZING). . A GROWING UNDERSTANDING OF THE SURFACE AND DEEP OVERFLOWS, COUNTERFLOWS, AND RECIRCULATION PATTERNS WITHIN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC IS EMERGING THAT INDICATES STRONGER INFLUENCES OF THE ATLANTIC SURFACE WATER (AW) AND ARCTIC-ORIGIN WATER (ARW) ON EACH OTHER AND ON THE AVERAGE CIRCULATION PATTERNS WITHIN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. WE DEFINE THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC AS THE REGION ENCOMPASSED BY THE GREENLAND-ICELAND-NORWEGIAN (GIN), IRMINGER AND LABRADOR SEAS, WHERE WARMER AND SALTIER AW LADEN WITH NUTRIENTS, PLANKTON AND DETRITUS MOVES NORTH IN MULTIPLE BRANCHES INTO THE LABRADOR SEA, INTO THE GIN SEAS AND, EVENTUALLY, INTO THE ARCTIC OCEAN. FRESHER AND COLDER ARW WITH SEA ICE, LOW NUTRIENTS, LOW PLANKTON AND HIGH COLORED DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER MOVES SOUTHWARDS ALONG THE EDGE OF THE EASTERN GREENLAND AND WESTERN LABRADOR SEAS AND INTO THE N.

ATLANTIC AND ARCTIC OCEANS; (II) LATERAL AND VERTICAL  EXPORT  PRODUCTION WITHIN SUB-REGIONS OF THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC AT INTERMEDIATE SCALES; AND (III) ADVECTIVE AND LOCAL PROCESSES CONTROLLING NETPP IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC REGION. OUR QUESTIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: . (Q1) WHAT BOTTOM-UP (PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL) FACTORS CONTROL THE NETPP LEVELS IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC, WHERE AND WHEN? (Q2) WHAT ARE THE CONTROLS OF SEASONAL AND SUB-SEASONAL VARIABILITIES AND TRENDS IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC? (Q3) WHAT IS THE BALANCE BETWEEN LOCAL AND ADVECTED NETPP IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC DURING THE GROWTH SEASON? . WE PROPOSE TO USE A HIERARCHY OF MODELS INCLUDING A FULL 3D, COUPLED, BIOGEOCHEMICAL-PHYSICAL MODEL AT REGIONAL SCALE (SINMOD) AND A SPECIALIZED 1D SATELLITE OCEAN COLOR MODEL FOR PHYTOPLANKTON NETPP (UQAR-TAKUVIK), BOTH OF WHICH ARE EXCEPTIONALLY WELL TUNED TO HIGH LATITUDES. MODEL SIMULATIONS WILL BE DONE IN CONCERT WITH MINING HISTORICAL FIELD AND SATELLITE DATA TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF NETPP AND ITS PHYSICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CONTROLS OVER AN AVERAGE ANNUAL CYCLE IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC. . OUR RESULTS WILL SHED LIGHT IF THE MAGNITUDE OF NETPP WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE DUE TO ENHANCED STRATIFICATION (WARMER AW OR FRESHER ARW CONDITIONS, LESS NUTRIENTS) AND GRAZING (IMMIGRATING OR RETURNING ZOOPLANKTON). ALTERNATIVELY, LESS SEA ICE IN FRAM STRAIT AND THE GREENLAND SEA MAY RESULT IN MORE AND EARLIER OPEN WATERS AND LESS STRATIFICATION THAT MAY LEAD TO HIGHER NETPP VALUES, AS HAS BEEN PREDICTED NORTH AND EAST OF SPITSBERGEN.

WHILE RECENT ADVANCES IN DNA SEQUENCING METAGENOMIC AND SINGLE CELL GENOMIC TECHNIQUES HAVE REVOLUTIONIZED THE ABILITY TO UNCOVER GENOMIC INFORMATION FROM THESE GROUPS, LINKAGE OF THIS INFORMATION TO FUNCTION IN THE ENVIRONMENT IS TENUOUS. THIS CHALLENGE IS MAGNIFIED IN LOW-ENERGY ANALOG ENVIRONMENTS, WHERE MEASURING RATES OF ACTIVITY IS DIFFICULT DUE TO DETECTION LIMITS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO TACKLE THIS CHALLENGE THROUGH APPLICATION OF NASCENT SINGLE-CELL-LEVEL FLUORESCENT SUBSTRATE LABELING TECHNIQUES THAT IDENTIFY ACTIVE CELLS USING FLOW CYTOMETRIC SORTING AND GENOMIC SEQUENCING IN A RELEVANT ANALOG SYSTEM.

SPECIFICALLY, THIS PROJECT WILL LEVERAGE AN NSF-FUNDED EXPEDITION IN 2019 TO SUBSEAFLOOR OBSERVATORIES ON THE EASTERN FLANK OF THE JUAN DE FUCA RIDGE TO ENABLE IN SITU EXPERIMENTATION AND COLLECTION OF PRISTINE SAMPLES. LIVE MICROBIAL CELLS IN THIS HIGH-PRESSURE, THERMOPHILIC (64 C), ANOXIC SYSTEM WILL BE SELECTED THROUGH INCORPORATION OF FLUOROGENIC SUBSTRATES INSIDE THE CELL, ENABLING SORTING OF THESE CELLS FROM THE BULK COMMUNITY THROUGH FLOW CYTOMETRY. VARIOUS METABOLISMS INCLUDING CARBON MONOXIDE, IRON, AND SULFUR OXIDATION WILL BE EXPLORED THROUGH ENRICHMENT EXPERIMENTS   PATHWAYS OF RELEVANCE TO CONSTRAINING CHEMOLITHOTROPHY ON EXTRATERRESTRIAL TARGETS LIKE EUROPA AND ENCELADUS. PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED WITH SIMILAR SUBSURFACE OCEAN CRUST SAMPLES FROM A DIFFERENT SYSTEM CONFIRM THAT CELLS IN LOW BIOMASS, LOW ENERGY SYSTEMS CAN BE LABELED IN THIS WAY, AND THAT THESE CELLS ARE AMENABLE TO DOWNSTREAM GENOME SEQUENCING. IF SUCCESSFUL, RESULTS OF THIS PROJECT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCE UNDERSTANDING OF THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONAL POTENTIAL AND VIABILITY OF VARIOUS MEMBERS OF LOW-ENERGY SUBSURFACE ANALOG MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY ARE DOMINANT OR RARE MEMBERS OF THE POPULATION. THIS WOULD ESTABLISH A REVOLUTIONARY APPROACH TO CONNECTING PHYSIOLOGY TO GENOMIC INFORMATION, WHICH HAS APPLICATIONS BEYOND EXOBIOLOGY. CONFIRMING THE APPLICATION OF THIS METHOD IN A REMOTE ANALOG SYSTEM WOULD IMPACT NASA MISSION INTERESTS SEEKING TO IDENTIFY METHODS FOR BIOSIGNATURE DETECTION AND POSSIBLE SCENARIOS FOR EXPERIMENTATION ON FUTURE ROVERS TO IDENTIFY LIFE. THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS RELEVANT TO SPECIFIC RESEARCH EMPHASES IN THIS SOLICITATION AS WELL AS SEVERAL OF THE MAJOR TOPICS IN THE NASA ASTROBIOLOGY STRATEGY 2015.

WE WILL USE SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS TO ESTIMATE CARBON FLUXES ASSOCIATED WITH: PRIMARY PRODUCTION, CALCIFICATION, DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON TRANSFER FROM RIVERS-TO-SEA, CARBON DIOXIDE AIR-SEA FLUXES, AND CARBON EXPORT FROM SURFACE WATERS TO DEPTH. THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF STANDING STOCKS AND CARBON FLUXES WILL BE ANALYZED TO SYNTHESIZE THE OBSERVATIONS OF DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CARBON CYCLE AND DETERMINE THE GULF OF MAINE S ROLE AS A NET CARBON SOURCE OR SINK. THE METHODS DEVELOPED IN THIS PROJECT TO CHARACTERIZE CARBON WILL RESULT IN PARAMETERS THAT ARE RELEVANT NOT ONLY TO CARBON MONITORING BUT FOR MONITORING OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AS WELL. COASTAL AND OCEAN ACIDIFICATION IS OF CONCERN IN THE GULF OF MAINE REGION; HENCE WE WILL COLLABORATE WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THE SCIENCE OUTPUTS OF THIS PROJECT ARE WHAT ARE REQUIRED BY THEIR NETWORK OF STATE AND FEDERAL RESOURCE MANAGERS AND INDUSTRY PARTNERS. THIS PROJECT ALIGNS WITH KEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE SECOND STATE OF THE CARBON CYCLE REPORT AS WE WILL (1) EXPAND THE GNATS PROGRAM BY CREATING REMOTE SENSING METHODS TO CHARACTERIZE THE EXCHANGE OF CARBON AND EXTEND THIS UNDERSTANDING ACROSS THE WHOLE REGION, (2) SYNTHESIZE OBSERVATIONS FROM ALL FOUR CARBON POOLS AND KEY FLUX TERMS EXCHANGING CARBON ACROSS THE SYSTEM, AND (3) PROVIDE DATA PRODUCTS ESSENTIAL FOR MONITORING OCEAN ACIDIFICATION, A NEED FOR STAKEHOLDERS AROUND THE GULF OF MAINE.",,,,

DURING MUCH OF EARTH''S HISTORY, PROBABLY STARTING AROUND 3 BILLION YEARS AGO, WHEN O2 LEVELS WERE MUCH LOWER OR FLUCTUATED BETWEEN OXIC AND ANOXIC CONDITIONS, THE OCEANS WERE REPLETE WITH FERROUS IRON. IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT FEOB FLOURISHED. THESE BACTERIA COULD HAVE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN SHAPING CONDITIONS FOR LIFE ON THE EARLY EARTH, FURTHERMORE, DUE TO THE OVERALL ABUNDANCE OF IRON ON PLANETS AND PLANETARY BODIES, FE REDOX CHEMISTRY COULD BE A FUNDAMENTAL METABOLISM FOR EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT AS A CONSEQUENCE OF MICROBIAL GROWTH ON IRON AT CIRCUMNEUTRAL PH, FEOB PRODUCE UNIQUE ORGANO-METALLIC NANO-AND MICRO-STRUCTURES THAT ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE ROCK RECORD, FORMING A BIOSIGNATURE FOR THEIR EXISTENCE AND ACTIVITY. NONETHELESS, OXYGEN-DEPENDENT FE-OXIDATION AT CIRCUMNEUTRAL PH REMAINS AMONG THE LEAST WELL UNDERSTOOD MAJOR LITHOTROPHIC METABOLISMS ON EARTH. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP A MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF MICROBIAL IRON OXIDATION USING COMPARATIVE GENOMICS AND TRANSCRIPTOMICS, AS WELL AS CONSTRAIN THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM BY ASSESSING THE DIVERSITY OF MECHANISMS CURRENTLY DISPLAYED BY MODERN FE-OXIDIZING BACTERIA. WITHIN THIS CONTEXT, A MAJOR TECHNICAL CHALLENGE WILL BE DEVELOPMENT OF A ROBUST PIPELINE FOR ANALYZING SINGLE CELL TRANSCRIPTOMES FROM BACTERIA. SINGLE CELL TRANSCRIPTOMICS IS A NOVEL APPROACH THAT WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION, NOT ONLY ABOUT THE GENETIC POTENTIAL OF UNCULTIVATED MICROBES, BUT ALSO ABOUT WHAT GENES THEY ARE ACTUALLY EXPRESSING, PROVIDING DIRECT INSIGHT TO IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS THE BACTERIA ARE CARRYING OUT. IN ADDITION, IN TARGETING A POORLY UNDERSTOOD METABOLISM LIKE FE-OXIDATION, TRANSCRIPTOMIC ANALYSIS MAY PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION AS TO THE SPECIFIC GENES OR GENE FAMILIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN ENERGY CONSERVATION FROM FE-OXIDATION. WHILE THE SINGLE CELL GENOMICS CENTER AT BIGELOW HAS PROVEN ITS SUCCESS AT ACQUIRING DNA AND GENOMIC SEQUENCES FROM SINGLE CELLS, THE ACQUISITION OF MRNA AND DETERMINATION OF MRNA SEQUENCES HAS NOT BEEN DONE BEFORE ON ENVIRONMENTAL MICROORGANISMS. THUS, THIS APPROACH WILL OFFER SEVERAL TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES THAT, IF SUCCESSFULLY MET, WILL GREATLY ENHANCE OUR CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND DIVERSE MICROBIAL METABOLISMS, INDEPENDENT OF OUR ABILITY TO CULTIVATE THE MICROBES RESPONSIBLE. IN ADDITION TO THIS SINGLE CELL TRANSCRIPTOMICS APPROACH, WORK WILL CONTINUE WITH THE EXPLORATION OF GENOMES FROM CURRENTLY AVAILABLE SINGLE AMPLIFIED GENOMES OF BOTH FRESHWATER AND MARINE FEOB, AS WELL AS ANALYSIS OF IN-SITU HABITATS USING MORE CONVENTIONAL METAGENOMIC AND METATRANSCRIPTOME METHODS. DUE TO THE UNIQUE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF THESE TWO MAJOR GROUPS OF FE-OXIDIZERS, THIS KIND OF COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS COULD WELL INFORM US ABOUT MODES OF MICROBIAL EVOLUTION RELATED TO IRON METABOLISM. THE FEOB ARE AN EXCELLENT GROUP OF MICROBES TO TEST THESE METHODS ON DUE TO THEIR UNIQUE PHYSIOLOGY, DIVERSE, BUT CONSERVED PHYLOGENY AND EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY, AS WELL THERE BEING A GROUP OF CULTURED REPRESENTATIVES WITHIN A MUCH LARGER GROUP OF UNCULTIVATED MEMBERS.

A FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE IS TO PREDICT WHETHER NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION (NETPP) IN THIS REGION WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE UNDER CHANGING NORTHERLY AND SOUTHERLY ADVECTIVE FLOWS. HERE, WE SUGGEST THAT THE BALANCE WILL DEPEND ON REGIONAL BOTTOM-UP DRIVERS (E.G., STRATIFICATION, NUTRIENT AND LIGHT AVAILABILITY, COMMUNITY COMPOSITION) AND TOP-DOWN DRIVERS (E.G., GRAZING). A GROWING UNDERSTANDING OF THE SURFACE AND DEEP OVERFLOWS, COUNTERFLOWS, AND RECIRCULATION PATTERNS WITHIN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC IS EMERGING THAT INDICATES STRONGER INFLUENCES OF THE ATLANTIC SURFACE WATER (AW) AND ARCTIC-ORIGIN WATER (ARW) ON EACH OTHER AND ON THE AVERAGE CIRCULATION PATTERNS WITHIN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. WE DEFINE THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC AS THE REGION ENCOMPASSED BY THE GREENLAND-ICELAND-NORWEGIAN (GIN), IRMINGER AND LABRADOR SEAS, WHERE WARMER AND SALTIER AW LADEN WITH NUTRIENTS, PLANKTON AND DETRITUS MOVES NORTH IN MULTIPLE BRANCHES INTO THE LABRADOR SEA, INTO THE GIN SEAS AND, EVENTUALLY, INTO THE ARCTIC OCEAN. FRESHER AND COLDER ARW WITH SEA ICE, LOW NUTRIENTS, LOW PLANKTON AND HIGH COLORED DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER MOVES SOUTHWARDS ALONG THE EDGE OF THE EASTERN GREENLAND AND WESTERN LABRADOR SEAS AND INTO THE N.

ATLANTIC AND ARCTIC OCEANS; (II) LATERAL AND VERTICAL EXPORT PRODUCTION WITHIN SUB-REGIONS OF THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC AT INTERMEDIATE SCALES; AND (III) ADVECTIVE AND LOCAL PROCESSES CONTROLLING NETPP IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC REGION. OUR QUESTIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: (Q1) WHAT BOTTOM-UP (PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL) FACTORS CONTROL THE NETPP LEVELS IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC, WHERE AND WHEN? (Q2) WHAT ARE THE CONTROLS OF SEASONAL AND SUB-SEASONAL VARIABILITIES AND TRENDS IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC? (Q3) WHAT IS THE BALANCE BETWEEN LOCAL AND ADVECTED NETPP IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC DURING THE GROWTH SEASON? WE PROPOSE TO USE A HIERARCHY OF MODELS INCLUDING A FULL 3D, COUPLED, BIOGEOCHEMICAL-PHYSICAL MODEL AT REGIONAL SCALE (SINMOD) AND A SPECIALIZED 1D SATELLITE OCEAN COLOR MODEL FOR PHYTOPLANKTON NETPP (UQAR-TAKUVIK), BOTH OF WHICH ARE EXCEPTIONALLY WELL TUNED TO HIGH LATITUDES. MODEL SIMULATIONS WILL BE DONE IN CONCERT WITH MINING HISTORICAL FIELD AND SATELLITE DATA TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF NETPP AND ITS PHYSICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CONTROLS OVER AN AVERAGE ANNUAL CYCLE IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC. OUR RESULTS WILL SHED LIGHT IF THE MAGNITUDE OF NETPP WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE DUE TO ENHANCED STRATIFICATION (WARMER AW OR FRESHER ARW CONDITIONS, LESS NUTRIENTS) AND GRAZING (IMMIGRATING OR RETURNING ZOOPLANKTON). ALTERNATIVELY, LESS SEA ICE IN FRAM STRAIT AND THE GREENLAND SEA MAY RESULT IN MORE AND EARLIER OPEN WATERS AND LESS STRATIFICATION THAT MAY LEAD TO HIGHER NETPP VALUES, AS HAS BEEN PREDICTED NORTH AND EAST OF SPITSBERGEN.

COASTAL OCEANS CONTRIBUTE ABOUT 1/3 OF THE TOTAL MARINE PRODUCTIVITY ACROSS THE GLOBE (OR ABOUT 16 PG (1PG =1E15G)). THEY RECEIVE ABOUT 1PG FROM TERRESTRIAL DISCHARGE VIA RIVERS. THEY CONTRIBUTE ABOUT HALF OF THE TOTAL GLOBAL OCEAN NEW PRODUCTION (3.6PG). THESE ARE BIG NUMBERS YET WE STILL DO NOT KNOW WHETHER COASTAL MARGINS ARE NET SOURCES OR SINKS FOR CARBON. THERE ARE FOUR COMPONENTS OF THE CARBON CYCLE PARTICULATE ORGANIC CARBON (POC), PARTICULATE INORGANIC CARBON (PIC), DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC), AND DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON (DIC). THE FIRST THREE CARBON FRACTIONS (POC, PIC, AND DOC) CAN BE ESTIMATED USING OPTICAL PROXIES WHILE THE FOURTH (DIC, ASSOCIATED WITH OCEAN ACIDIFICATION) IS BEST MEASURED CHEMICALLY. THERE ARE FEW COASTAL TIME SERIES THAT ASSESS ALL OF THESE COMPONENTS. THIS PROPOSAL IS A SUCCESSOR PROPOSAL FOR THE GULF OF MAINE NORTH ATLANTIC TIME SERIES (GNATS), AN 18-YEAR TRANSECT TIME SERIES ACROSS THE GULF OF MAINE (GOM) USING FERRIES, SMALL RESEARCH VESSELS, AND GLIDERS TO MEASURE ALL FOUR PARTS OF THE CARBON CYCLE. DURING SEVERAL ANOMALOUSLY WET YEARS, GNATS DOCUMENTED SOME FUNDAMENTAL SHIFTS IN THE GOM SUCH AS SIGNIFICANT DROPS IN PRIMARY PRODUCTION (ASSOCIATED WITH POC AND PIC PRODUCTION) AND THE APPEARANCE OF UNEXPECTED HIGHLY SCATTERING PARTICLES<0.2UM DIAMETER (HENCE DOC), WELL OUT TO SEA. WE HAVE ALSO OBSERVED WINTER DIC CONCENTRATIONS ACROSS THE GOM, LOW ENOUGH THAT THE ENTIRE GOM CAN SHOW LOW ARAGONITE SATURATION VALUES<1.6 LEVELS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE INHIBITORY TO CALCIFICATION BY CERTAIN MARINE ORGANISMS.

WE INCLUDE PREVIOUS RESULTS DEMONSTRATING THAT WE CAN TRACK WATER MASSES USING TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY, THEN DOCUMENT CO-VARYING CHANGES IN POC (BASED ON AN OPTICAL PROXY TO PARTICLE BACKSCATTERING), OXYGEN, AND CHLOROPHYLL IN THESE WATER MASSES; THESE ALLOW THE ESTIMATION OF NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION (NPP) AND NET COMMUNITY PRODUCTION. WE ALSO SHOW HOW ALLOMETRIC SCALING MODELS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THESE ESTIMATIONS. WE ARE REQUESTING FUNDS TO UPGRADE ONE OF OUR SLOCUM GLIDERS TO CARRY A SUNA NITRATE SENSOR THAT WILL ALLOW US TO MORE ACCURATELY ESTIMATE NITRATE DEPLETION AND NPP. THESE GLIDER RESULTS WILL ALLOW US TO BETTER DISCERN AND QUANTIFY WHETHER THE GOM IS A NET SOURCE OR SINK FOR CARBON. ALONG WITH A WHOLE HOST OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES, GNATS PROVIDES CRITICAL INSIGHTS ABOUT THE MAJOR PROCESSES AFFECTING ALL ASPECTS OF THE CARBON CYCLE IN THIS TEMPERATE COASTAL REGION: CHANGES IN PRODUCTIVITY, HYDROGRAPHY, PHYTOPLANKTON FUNCTIONAL GROUPS, LAND-SEA CARBON TRANSPORT CAUSED BY MAJOR RIVERINE FLOOD EVENTS AND DROUGHTS, PLUS POTENTIAL CHANGES DUE TO OCEAN ACIDIFICATION. SUCH RESULTS WILL PROVIDE INSIGHTS TO OTHER TEMPERATE COASTAL ZONES AROUND THE GLOBE.

THE EARTH-MARS DECELERATOR HAS ITS FOUNDATION WITH THE DRAG BRAKE CONCEPT AS AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO SAFELY RETURNING ASTRONAUTS FROM ORBIT. THERE ARE THREE IMPORTANT INNOVATIVE FEATURES OF THE DRAG BRAKE THAT DISTINGUISH ITS BENEFITS. FIRST, THE USE OF A LARGE UMBRELLA-LIKE SHAPE FORCES VEHICLE SLOWDOWN AT THE HIGHER ATMOSPHERIC ALTITUDES ESSENTIALLY REDUCING THE HEATING RATE SO MUCH THAT IT ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR A HEAVY THERMAL PROTECTION SYSTEM. SECOND, THE ABILITY TO MODULATE THE LIFT AND DRAG BEHAVIOR BY REORIENTING THE DRAG BRAKE AT THE LOWER ALTITUDES PERMITS MORE PRECISE LANDING LOCATIONS AND SLOWER LANDING SPEEDS. THIRD, CARBON-BASED MATERIAL CHOICES AND STRUCTURAL DESIGNS (AS OPPOSED TO STAINLESS STEEL MATERIALS) PROVIDE LIGHTER AND STRONGER DECELERATORS WITH APPROPRIATE SURFACE EMISSIVITY AND ANTI-OXIDATIVE COATINGS. IN ADDITION TO THESE THREE FEATURES, THE NEW DRAG BRAKE CONCEPT ALSO HAS THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL BENEFICIAL CHARACTERISTICS. FLEXIBLE DECELERATOR HAS NEVER DEMONSTRATED IN RE-ENTRY FLIGHT. THIS IS A UNIQUE PROGRAM GOAL. BLUNT SHAPE AERODYNAMICALLY STABLE THROUGH ENTIRE RE-ENTRY FLIGHT REGIME.

THE RECENTLY LAUNCHED GAIA ASTROMETRY TELESCOPE, WHICH OBSERVES 1 BILLION STARS IN OUR GALAXY (1% OF THE GALACTIC STELLAR POPULATION), IS PROVIDING UNPRECEDENTED POSITIONAL AND RADIAL VELOCITY MEASUREMENTS THAT CAN REVEAL FURTHER PLANETS IN BINARY SYSTEMS. AS WITH PLANETS AROUND SINGLE STARS, THESE PLANETS IN BINARY SYSTEMS CONTINUE TO RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR POTENTIAL HABITABILITY. PREVIOUS STUDIES OF THE HABITABLE ZONE (HZ) OF BINARY SYSTEMS CONSIDERED ONLY THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN THE PEAK OF THE COMBINED SPECTRAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTION (SED) OF THE TWO STARS; HOWEVER, THE SPECTRAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTION (SED) FOR PLANETS IN BINARY SYSTEMS SHOULD BE A SUPERPOSITION OF BOTH HOST STARS. HABITABILITY IS DEFINED AS THE ABILITY OF A TERRESTRIAL PLANET TO SUSTAIN LIQUID WATER ON ITS SURFACE, WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE ENERGY BALANCE OF A PLANET S ATMOSPHERE. GREENHOUSE GASES LIKE WATER VAPOR AND CARBON DIOXIDE ABSORB RADIATION AT BOTH LONG (INFRARED) AND SHORT (ULTRAVIOLET) WAVELENGTHS, WHICH MAKES THE CLIMATE SENSITIVE TO THE FULL COMBINED SED OF BOTH STARS. WE EXPECT THAT THE HZ FOR PLANETS IN BINARY SYSTEMS SHOULD BE A FUNCTION OF THE SED OF THE BINARY SYSTEM, WHICH WILL DEPEND UPON THE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF EACH STELLAR SYSTEM. WE WILL ALSO STUDY THE DIFFERENCES IN DIURNAL PATTERNS OF SOLAR INSOLATION CAUSED BY BOTH P-TYPE AND S-TYPE PLANETARY ORBITS WITHIN BINARY SYSTEMS. WE EXPECT THE ORBITAL CONFIGURATIONS OF BINARY SYSTEMS TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE DEFINITION OF HABITABLE ZONES. METHODS THIS RESEARCH WILL CONSTRAIN THE HZ FOR PLANETS IN BINARY SYSTEMS BY USING A HIERARCHY OF EXISTING CLIMATE MODELS. WE WILL USE OBSERVED STELLAR SPECTRA AND STELLAR EVOLUTIONARY MODELS TO DEVELOP SEVERAL SCENARIOS FOR THE COMBINED SED OF BOTH P-TYPE AND S-TYPE BINARY SYSTEMS. WE WILL FIRST STUDY THE EFFECT OF SUPERPOSITION OF MULTIPLE STELLAR SPECTRA USING A LINE-BY-LINE RADIATIVE TRANSFER MODEL. THESE CALCULATIONS WILL SET BENCHMARKS FOR EVALUATION OF THE CORRELATED-K RADIATIVE TRANSFER CODES USED SUBSEQUENTLY. WE WILL THEN EVALUATE THE HZ FOR BINARY SYSTEM IN COMBINATIONS OF F, G, K, AND M TYPES USING A ONE-DIMENSIONAL RADIATIVE CONVECTIVE CLIMATE MODEL, WHICH WILL PROVIDE A BASIS OF COMPARISON AGAINST CLASSIC SINGLE-STAR HZ CALCULATIONS IN THE LITERATURE. WE WILL NEXT USE THIS 1-D MODEL TO PARAMETERIZE THE RADIATIVE TRANSFER IN A 2-D LATITUDINAL ENERGY BALANCE MODEL, WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO CONSIDER THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO HABITABILITY OF NON-CIRCULAR ORBITS AND ICE-ALBEDO FEEDBACK. WE WILL THEN EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF BINARY SED ON ATMOSPHERIC DYNAMICS BY USING FULL THREE-DIMENSIONAL GENERAL CIRCULATION MODELS TO QUANTIFY CHANGES IN LARGE-SCALE CIRCULATION THAT AFFECT HABITABILITY. BY USING THESE 3-D MODELS, WE CAN SELF-CONSISTENTLY SIMULATE ALL ASPECTS OF CLIMATE, WHICH INCLUDES GEOPHYSICAL AND ORBITAL PROPERTIES, RADIATIVE TRANSFER, DYNAMICS, AND CLOUDS. RELEVANCE THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH IS RELEVANT TO NASA S HABITABLE WORLDS PROGRAM AS A THEORETICAL STUDY OF THE CLIMATES OF EXTRASOLAR TERRESTRIAL PLANETS AND THEIR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN THE PRESENCE OF WATER. THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH WILL HELP  TO IDENTIFY THE CHARACTERISTICS AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF POTENTIALLY HABITABLE ENVIRONMENTS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND BEYOND  (C.4-1) BY USING A HIERARCHY OF EXISTING CLIMATE MODELS TO CONSTRAIN THE HZ OF PLANETS IN BINARY STAR SYSTEMS.

THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO SUPPORT WORK ON A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR THE CHARACTERIZATION AND INTERPRETATION OF HABITABILITY AND BIOSIGNATURES FOR PLANETARY BODIES WITHIN AND BEYOND THE SOLAR SYSTEM. THIS FRAMEWORK MOVES BEYOND A BINARY CHARACTERIZATION OF THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF LIQUID WATER, OR WHETHER A PUTATIVE BIOSIGNATURE IS BIOTIC OR ABIOTIC. INSTEAD, THE EFFORT SEEKS TO CHARACTERIZE THE DEGREE OF HABITABILITY OF DIFFERENT PLANETARY ENVIRONMENTS BY CONSIDERING OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR LIFE, AND AIMS TO ASSESS THE ABILITY OF A BIOSPHERE TO PRODUCE DETECTABLE BIOSIGNATURES AFTER CONSIDERING ENERGY LIMITATIONS ON PRODUCTIVITY, AS WELL AS BIOSIGNATURE DEGRADATION PROCESSES. BUT HOW WERE THESE BIOSIGNATURES EMPLACED INITIALLY? TO ADDRESS THIS, THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO FURTHER SUPPORT RESEARCH ON HOW EVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES CAN ALLOW LIFE TO EMERGE AND THEN EXPAND TO DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS? EVOLUTION THAT DRIVES INANIMATE MATTER TO BECOME ANIMATE HAS TO BE OPEN-ENDED, I.E. CONTINUALLY PRODUCE NOVEL AND ADAPTIVE FORMS. ALSO, ANY FORM OF LIFE THAT CANNOT LIBERATE ITSELF FROM THE INITIAL PREBIOTIC NICHE IS UNLIKELY TO SURVIVE.

HOW THIS HAPPENS REMAINS LARGELY UNKNOWN.

HOWEVER, NATURALLY OCCURRING􀁅COMMON􀁅 ABIOTIC SYNTHETIC PROCESSES THAT TAKE PLACE TODAY OR IN THE EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM WERE GENERALLY ASSUMED TO PRODUCE ONLY RACEMIC MIXTURES, WHICH ARE EQUAL AMOUNTS OF ENANTIOMERS. THE FACT THAT LIFE ON EARTH HAS STRICT HOMOCHIRALITY MIGHT IMPLY THAT, VERY EARLY, THERE WERE UBIQUITOUS AND DETERMINING PHYSICAL FORCES THAT DIRECTED THE DIRECTION OF ENANTIOMER EXCESSES IN ORGANIC BIOPOLYMERS (E.G., THEY PREFERENTIALLY AIDED THE SYNTHESIS OF \L\"" AMINO ACIDS AND \""D\"" SUGARS). HOWEVER, THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF EXPERIMENTS THAT ATTEMPT TO CREATE ENANTIOMER EXCESSES BEGIN WITH PRE-MADE (PRE-SYNTHESIZED) PAIRS OF ENANTIOMERS, E.G., THE SLIGHT PREFERENTIAL DESTRUCTION OF ONE ENANTIOMER BY RIGHT OR LEFT CIRCULARLY POLARIZED LIGHT (FLORES, BONNER, AND MASSEY 1977, JACS). LIKEWISE, RESEARCH ON COMBINED MAGNETISM PLUS RADIATION (PHOTO-MAGNETIC) EFFECTS HAS SO FAR BEEN APPLIED (MOSTLY THEORETICALLY) TO INORGANIC COMPLEXES (ALSO ASSUMING PRE-EXISTING ENANTIOMERS), RESULTING IN THE PRODUCTION OF VERY SMALL (#tilde# 10-4) EXCESSES BETWEEN ENANTIOMERS (RIKKEN AND RAUPACH, 2000, NATURE). HOWEVER, WE PROPOSE THAT PHOTO-MAGNETIC EFFECTS DURING ACTUAL SYNTHETIC REACTIONS (FORMOSE-LIKE REACTIONS) MIGHT BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING SIGNIFICANT ENANTIOMER EXCESSES. THE PRODUCTS OF THESE REACTIONS WOULD BE BIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT ORGANIC COMPOUNDS: SUCH REACTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT ON THE EARLY EARTH AND OTHER SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES.

IN LABORATORY MODEL SYSTEMS, NUCLEIC ACID POLYMERS DO NOT FORM TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT IF THEIR MONOMER BUILDING BLOCKS ARE RACEMIC, E.G., G. JOYCE ET AL., 1984, PNAS. SUCH RESULTS MIGHT IMPLY THAT REPLICATING MOLECULES (AS WE KNOW THEM) REQUIRED NEAR-HOMOCHIRAL BUILDING BLOCKS. OUR PROPOSED RESEARCH MAY AT LEAST REVEAL A POSSIBLE MECHANISM OF CREATING ENANTIOMER EXCESSES IN SUCH PRECURSORS DURING THE ACTUAL SYNTHESIS OF COMPOUNDS FROM REALISTIC AND WIDELY AVAILABLE PREBIOTIC MOLECULES.""",,,,

AUTONOMOUS GNC ALLOWS A SPACECRAFT TO PERFORM MOST OF ITS OWN NAVIGATION ACTIVITIES WITHOUT THE NEED FOR GROUND-BASED PERSONNEL AND DSN TIME, REDUCING COST AND REQUIRED DSN CONTACT TIME, SAVING MONEY, AND ALLOWING SPECIALIZED NAVIGATION PERSONNEL FROM DIFFERENT NASA CENTERS TO BE EASILY SHARED AMONG MISSIONS. AUTONOMOUS GNC ACTIVITIES INCLUDE: -SPACECRAFT POSITIONING ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE (HELIO, PLANET, SMALL-BODY) RELATIVE TO SMALL BODIES, OTHER SPACECRAFT FOR RENDEZVOUS -ORBIT DETERMINATION -TARGET TRACKING OF BODIES, APERTURES, SPACECRAFT, GROUND-BASED ASSETS -TRAJECTORY DERIVATION -LOW-THRUST MANEUVERING FOR SOLAR ELECTRIC PROPULSION (SEP) -EPHEMERIS CALCULATIONS AUTONAV FROM THE JET PROPULSION LABORATORY IMPLEMENTS THESE FUNCTIONS, AND COMPONENTS HAVE FLOWN ON DEEP SPACE 1 AND DEEP IMPACT.

SINCE THE CURIOSITY ROVER LANDED IN GALE CRATER, A DIVERSE RANGE OF COMPOSITIONS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN IGNEOUS FLOAT ROCKS, SEDIMENTARY ROCKS, AND IGNEOUS CLASTS WITHIN SEDIMENTARY ROCKS THAT HAD NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED IN SITU ON MARS. THESE ROCKS EXHIBIT A VARIETY OF TEXTURES AND MINERALOGIES, AND HAVE BULK COMPOSITIONS RANGING FROM MAFIC TO FELSIC, WITH A RANGE OF ALKALI ENRICHMENTS. THESE RECENTLY OBSERVED COMPOSITIONS PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THE CRUST OF MARS IS NOT EXCLUSIVELY BASALTIC, BUT ALSO DISPLAYS FELSIC AND ALKALINE COMPOSITIONS. ON EARTH, THESE COMPOSITIONS ARE MOSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH PLATE TECTONICS BUT CAN ALSO FORM AT SMALLER SCALES THROUGH INTRAPLATE MAGMATIC PROCESSES INVOLVING EXTENSIVE MAGMA FRACTIONAL CRYSTALLIZATION AND/OR VARIOUS DEGREES OF PARTIAL MELTING. THE PRESENCE OF FELSIC AND ALKALINE COMPOSITIONS ON MARS INDICATES THAT THESE MAGMATIC PROCESSES LIKELY OCCURRED IN THE MARTIAN INTERIOR AND THUS MARS MIGHT BE GEOLOGICALLY MORE SIMILAR TO EARLY AND MODERN EARTH THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. HOWEVER, THE MAGMATIC PROCESSES THAT COULD HAVE FORMED THE MARTIAN FELSIC AND ALKALINE COMPOSITIONS HAVE NOT BEEN WELL CONSTRAINED.

MARTIAN METEORITES ARE THE ONLY SOURCE MATERIAL FROM MARS AVAILABLE FOR STUDY WITH TERRESTRIAL LABORATORY PRECISION AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION. AS SUCH, THEY REPRESENT A FUNDAMENTAL SUITE OF ROCKS FOR CONSTRAINING THE GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF MARS. SHERGOTTITES, THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF MARTIAN METEORITES, ARE DIVIDED INTO THREE PETROLOGIC SUB-GROUPS: OLIVINEPHYRIC, BASALTIC, AND POIKILITIC. THE FOCUS OF THIS STUDY ARE THE POIKILITIC SHERGOTTITES. THEY ARE GABBROIC INTRUSIVE ROCKS THAT LIKELY REPRESENT A MAJOR LITHOLOGY OF THE MARTIAN CRUST. THE TERM POIKILITIC REFERS TO THEIR UNIQUE TEXTURE AMONGST THE MARTIAN METEORITES, WHICH CONSISTS OF TWO DOMAINS (FIG. 1): (DOMAIN 1) LARGE PYROXENE GRAINS (OIKOCRYST GRAINS) WITH INCLUSIONS OF PREVIOUSLY CRYSTALLIZED MINERALS, WHICH ARE FORMED EARLY IN THE MAGMA EVOLUTION AT THE BASE OF THE CRUST, AND (DOMAIN 2) INTERSTITIAL MATERIAL ENCLOSING THESE LARGE GRAINS, WHICH CRYSTALLIZED NEAR THE SURFACE AFTER ASCENT THROUGH THE CRUST. THESE TEXTURES ARE BELIEVED TO RESULT FROM SLOW MAGMA COOLING IN A DEEP RESERVOIR FOLLOWED BY RAPID COOLING LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH EMPLACEMENT AS HYPABYSSAL OR VOLCANIC ROCKS. THE POIKILITIC SHERGOTTITES RECORD IN THEIR CHEMISTRY TWO GEOCHEMICAL RESERVOIRS ENRICHED AND INTERMEDIATE DEFINED BY THEIR INCOMPATIBLE ELEMENT COMPOSITIONS AND COMPOSITIONS OF RADIOGENIC SR, ND, AND HF ISOTOPES. THE TWO DOMAINS IN BOTH ENRICHED AND INTERMEDIATE POIKILITIC SHERGOTTITES ALLOW US TO INVESTIGATE THE EVOLUTION OF THEIR PARENTAL MAGMA FROM THE CRUST/MANTLE BOUNDARY TO SHALLOW LEVELS, AS WELL AS POSSIBLE CRUSTAL CONTAMINATION. THE CURRENT MAJOR UNKNOWNS OF MARTIAN SHERGOTTITE MAGMATISM INCLUDE: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN METEORITE TEXTURES AND THEIR CONDITIONS OF CRYSTALLIZATION, MAGMA MANTLE/CRUSTAL INTERACTIONS, PETROGENETIC CONNECTIONS (OR NOT) BETWEEN SHERGOTTITES, AND ORIGIN OF SHERGOTTITE SOURCES. BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE BIMODAL TEXTURE, THEIR HIGH ABUNDANCES, AND THEIR DIFFERENT SOURCE RESERVOIRS, WE AIM TO USE THE POIKILITIC SHERGOTTITE METEORITES TO ADDRESS THESE KEY PROBLEMS THAT REMAIN CONTENTIOUS IN THE ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF SHERGOTTITE MAGMAS. WE WILL ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY: (GOAL 1) INVESTIGATING FORMATION PROCESSES OF POIKILITIC SHERGOTTITES AND PETROGENETIC COMPARISON WITH OTHER SHERGOTTITES; (GOAL 2) CONSTRAIN PARENTAL MAGMA COMPOSITION OF POIKILITIC SHERGOTTITES, ITS EVOLUTION, AND POTENTIAL CRUSTAL CONTAMINATION; AND (GOAL 3) ASSESSING TIME OF FORMATION, SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION, AND SOURCES OF POIKILITIC SHERGOTTITES AND LINK WITH OTHER SHERGOTTITES. TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, THE PROPOSED WORK WILL BE DIVIDED INTO THREE ANALYTICAL TASKS. THESE TASKS ARE EACH DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE THREE MAJOR INVESTIGATIVE GOALS. TASK 1, A COMPREHENSIVE PETROLOGIC STUDY OF POIKILITIC SHERGOTTITES, IS PLANNED, WHICH INCLUDES DETAILED IN SITU MAJOR AND TRACE ANALYSIS OF MINERALS IN TEXTURAL DOMAINS 1 AND 2 IN ALL ENRICHED AND INTERMEDIATE POIKILITIC SHERGOTTITES (GOAL 1).

THE UNDERLYING LAND SURFACE MODEL SIMULATION INTEGRATES HIGH QUALITY METEOROLOGICAL DATA AND ASSIMILATES GRAVITY RECOVERY AND CLIMATE EXPERIMENT (GRACE) SATELLITE-BASED TERRESTRIAL WATER STORAGE OBSERVATIONS. THE RESULTING INDICATORS ARE SERVED FROM THE NATIONAL DROUGHT MITIGATION CENTER S (NDMC) WEBSITE (HTTP://DROUGHT.UNL.EDU/MONITORINGTOOLS/NASAGRACEDATAASSIMILATION.ASPX) AND USED AS INPUT TO THE U.S. DROUGHT MONITOR, WHICH IS THE PREMIER DROUGHT PRODUCT FOR THE U.S. BECAUSE DEEP SOIL MOISTURE AND GROUNDWATER HAVE LONG MEMORIES (THEY CHANGE SLOWLY IN RESPONSE TO METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS), GRACE DATA HAVE AN IMPORTANT AND LASTING IMPACT ON THE LAND SURFACE MODEL SIMULATION. THE GRACE DATA THEMSELVES ARE ENHANCED THROUGH SYNTHESIS WITH HIGH RESOLUTION METEOROLOGICAL DATA CONSTRAINED BY LAND SURFACE MODEL PHYSICS. OUR GOAL IS TO EXTEND THE VALUE OF GRACE AND GRACE FOLLOW ON (GRACE FO) OBSERVATIONS THREE MONTHS INTO THE FUTURE BY DRIVING THE SAME LAND SURFACE MODEL WITH FORECAST METEOROLOGICAL DATA, TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE GROUNDWATER AND SOIL MOISTURE MEMORY AND MAKING USE OF NEW LOW-LATENCY GRACE HYDROLOGY PRODUCTS. THREE TYPES OF METEOROLOGICAL FORCING IN THE FORECAST PERIOD WILL BE TESTED: (1) METEOROLOGICAL FIELDS DRAWN FROM GEOS-5 FORECAST AND DOWNSCALED TO NORTH AMERICAN LAND DATA ASSIMILATION SYSTEM PHASE 2 (NLDAS-2) RESOLUTION (12.5KM) THROUGH BAYESIAN MERGING WITH HISTORICAL NLDAS-2 FIELDS; (2) A HYBRID STATISTICAL-DYNAMICAL METEOROLOGICAL FORECAST GENERATED THROUGH ANALOG DOWNSCALING, IN WHICH LARGE SCALE ATMOSPHERIC FIELDS FROM THE GEOS-5 FORECAST ARE PATTERN-MATCHED TO DAYS IN THE HISTORIC GEOS-5 ARCHIVE AND METEOROLOGICAL FIELDS ARE DRAWN FROM NLDAS FOR THOSE ANALOG DATES; AND (3) AS THE CONTROL,  NULL FORECAST  SIMULATIONS THAT ARE DRIVEN BY CLIMATOLOGY IN THE FORECAST PERIOD. THE SIMULATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT GRACE DATA ASSIMILATION IN THE RETROSPECTIVE PERIOD IN ORDER TO GAUGE ITS IMPACT. FURTHER, WE WILL QUANTIFY THE CONTRIBUTION OF EACH ASPECT OF THE FORECAST SYSTEM MEMORY IN THE LAND SURFACE MODEL, GRACE DATA ASSIMILATION, GEOS-5 FORECAST METEOROLOGY, AND GEOS-5 FORECAST OF LARGE SCALE ATMOSPHERIC PATTERNS TO SKILLFUL PREDICTION OF DROUGHT AND FLOOD. THE BEST PERFORMING CONFIGURATION WILL BE USED FOR THE FINAL FORECAST SYSTEM. THE LOW LATENCY GRACE TERRESTRIAL WATER STORAGE DATA ARE A UNIQUE ASPECT OF THIS PROPOSAL THAT GREATLY INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR GRACE AND GRACE FO TO ADD VALUE TO THE FORECASTS. THEY WERE DEVELOPED UNDER THE DIRECTION OF ONE OF THE CO-INVESTIGATORS, AND WE HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TESTING THEM AS INPUTS TO OUR DROUGHT MONITORING PRODUCTS. OUR TEAM INCLUDES PARTNERS FROM NDMC, NOAA S NORTH CENTRAL RIVER FORECAST CENTER, AND THE U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, WHO WILL DISTRIBUTE, TEST, AND MAKE USE OF THE RESULTING 30-90 DAY FORECASTED, 0.125  GRIDDED GROUNDWATER, SOIL MOISTURE, SNOW, AND OTHER FIELDS AND ASSOCIATED WETNESS INDICATORS. CONSIDERING THE STRENGTH OF OUR TEAM, OUR CONNECTIONS TO THE BROADER DROUGHT, RIVER FLOW, AND FLOOD COMMUNITIES, AND OUR PAST SUCCESS IN DELIVERING HIGH QUALITY WETNESS INDICATORS WHICH HAVE BEEN EMBRACED BY THE DROUGHT COMMUNITY, WE BELIEVE THE FORECAST DATA THAT RESULT FROM THIS PROJECT WILL BE QUICKLY ADOPTED BY AND HIGHLY VALUABLE TO END USERS. IF THIS PROPOSAL IS FUNDED, WE WILL APPLY FOR SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT AN ASSESSMENT OF THE VALUE OF THE INFORMATION TO END USERS, TO BE LED BY OUR PARTNERS ON AN ONGOING NASA APPLIED SCIENCES PROGRAM PROJECT WHOSE GOAL IS TO DO THE SAME FOR OUR CURRENT SUITE OF DROUGHT INDICATORS.",,,,

USING NOVEL COMBINATIONS OF MODIS BANDS (INCLUDING NEW CHLOROPHYLL:CAROTENOID INDICES, CCIS), WE WILL DEVELOP A NEW LIGHT-USE EFFICIENCY (LUE) MODEL. 2.  THE NEW LUE MODEL TERMS AND PRODUCTS (E.G. GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY, GPP) WILL BE COMPARED TO GROUND VALIDATION SITES WHERE FLUX AND OPTICAL DATA ARE AVAILABLE. 3.  WE WILL COMPARE THE NEW LUE MODEL TO OTHER MODELS, INCLUDING THE BENCHMARK MOD17 GPP PRODUCTS AND EMERGING GPP PRODUCTS FROM SOLAR-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE (SIF) METHODS (OCO2 SATELLITE SENSOR). 4.  USING THESE METHODS, WE WILL EVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GROWING SEASON LENGTH AND PRODUCTIVITY TO INVESTIGATE REPORTED BROWNING AND GREENING AND THEIR CAUSES AND IMPLICATIONS FOR DIFFERENT ECOSYSTEMS WITHIN THE ABOVE DOMAIN.  METHODS/TECHNIQUES: TO ACCOMPLISH THESE OBJECTIVES, WE WILL USE SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS COUPLED WITH GROUND VALIDATION TO INVESTIGATE CHANGING GROWING SEASON LENGTH AND ITS IMPACT ON THE CARBON BUDGET OF BOREAL AND ARCTIC REGIONS. A PRIMARY APPROACH WILL BE TO DEVELOP A NEW LIGHT-USE EFFICIENCY (LUE) MODEL OF ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY, BASED ON A NEW COMBINATION OF SATELLITE INDICES PROVIDED BY REPROCESSED MODIS PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION TO STANDARD MODIS PRODUCTS (E.G. NDVI) WE WILL UTILIZE NEWLY AVAILABLE CHLOROPHYLL:CAROTENOID INDICES (CCIS, DERIVED FROM NOVEL COMBINATIONS OF MODIS TERRESTRIAL&OCEAN BANDS CAPABLE OF INVISIBLE PHOTOSYNTHETIC PHENOLOGY IN EVERGREENS). OUR INITIAL EOGRAPHIC FOCUS WILL BE ON BOREAL REGIONS WHERE PHOTOSYNTHETIC DOWN REGULATION RESTRICTS PHOTOSYNTHETIC ACTIVITY, WHICH HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WITH CONVENTIONAL MEANS. BY THE END OF THE PROJECT PERIOD, MODELING WILL SPAN THE FULL RANGE OF ECOSYSTEMS ACROSS THE ABOVE DOMAIN, AND VALIDATION WILL INVOLVE BOTH GROUND NETWORKS AND INDEPENDENT SATELLITE-BASED PRODUCTIVITY ESTIMATES.  TO VALIDATE SATELLITE SENSOR AND LUE MODEL PRODUCTS WITH GROUND OBSERVATIONS, WE WILL UTILIZE EXISTING DATA FROM AN EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF GROUND STATIONS, CONSISTING OF FLUX TOWER AND OPTICAL PHENOLOGY STATIONS SPANNING THE ABOVE DOMAIN AND COVERING A RANGE OF CONDITIONS AND ECOSYSTEM TYPES. VALIDATION WILL CONSIDER BOTH SATELLITE OPTICAL INDICES AND THEIR MODELED FLUX PRODUCTS, AND WILL EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF SPATIAL SCALE, SAMPLING ANGLE, SPECTRAL SCALE, AND TEMPORAL AGGREGATION ON THE INTERPRETATION OF OPTICAL SIGNALS.  GROUND VALIDATION WILL ALSO CLARIFY THE CONFOUNDING EFFECTS OF CLOUDS, SNOW, ICE, AND STANDING WATER ON KEY VEGETATION OPTICAL INDICES, INCLUDING NDVI AND CCIS. ADDITIONAL VALIDATION WILL COMPARE SATELLITE PRODUCTS (E.G. GPP) TO THE STANDARD MODIS GPP PRODUCT (MOD17) WITH INDEPENDENT ESTIMATES FROM OCO2 FLUORESCENCE PRODUCTS AND ATMOSPHERIC INVERSIONS AS THESE BECOME AVAILABLE.  SIGNIFICANCE: THIS STUDY ADDRESSES THE ABOVE TOPICS OF REPORTED GREENING AND BROWNING OF NORTHERN ECOSYSTEMS, AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN THE SATELLITE NDVI RECORD. THESE SATELLITE NDVI OBSERVATIONS HAVE SUGGESTED POTENTIALLY LARGE CHANGES IN BOREAL AND ARCTIC CARBON BUDGETS, BIOGEOCHEMISTRY, SURFACE-ATMOSPHERE FEEDBACKS, AND DISTURBANCE REGIMES, BUT CAN ALSO BE SUBJECT TO MISINTERPRETATION DUE TO THE OVER-DETERMINED NATURE OF SATELLITE INDICES. BY UTILIZING THE FULL RANGE OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM MODIS PRODUCTS, WE WILL ENHANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES BEYOND WHAT IS POSSIBLE FROM EXITING NDVI-BASED METHODS ALONE, AND LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE MODELING EFFORTS AND SATELLITE SENSORS HAVING IMPROVED SENSITIVITY TO SUBTLE VEGETATION CHANGE AND ITS UNDERLYING FUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE. THIS IMPROVED ASSESSMENT OF ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFECTIVE GROWING SEASON LENGTH ACROSS THE ABOVE DOMAIN WILL ALLOW BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CARBON BALANCE AND OTHER ECOSYSTEM FEEDBACKS TO THE ATMOSPHERE AND CLIMATE FOR NORTHERN ECOSYSTEMS. BY LINKING TO AN EXTENSIVE GROUND VALIDATION NETWORK, WE WILL ALSO ENHANCE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUTREACH AND COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION ACROSS THE ABOVE DOMAIN.",,,,

OUR EFFORTS WILL CAPITALIZE ON AN EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF TREE INVENTORY PLOTS ALONG THE ELEVATION GRADIENT FROM THE HIGHLANDS TO EASTERN LOWLANDS IN PERU, ECUADOR, AND COLOMBIA THAT ENABLE US TO MAP THE CONTEMPORARY ABUNDANCE, DISTRIBUTION, DIVERSITY, AND EARLY RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE OF FOREST TREES, AND TO PLAN FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF A SIMILAR ALTITUDINAL NETWORK OF TREE PLOTS IN THE CHOCO FOREST. OUR SPATIAL DOMAINS FOCUS ON THREE REGIONS WITH EXCEPTIONAL BIODIVERSITY AND ENDEMISM: (1) PERU, WHICH ALREADY HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED WITH BOTH ACTIVE AND PASSIVE REMOTE SENSING DATA OF FOREST STRUCTURE AND BIODIVERSITY AND WITH STUDIES OF GEOLOGY, GEOMORPHOLOGY, AND CLIMATE; (2) ECUADOR, WHICH HAS BEEN LITTLE STUDIED FOR ANY OF THESE PARAMETERS; AND (3) COLOMBIA, WITH THE LARGEST AREA OF REMAINING CHOCO FOREST ALONG THE PACIFIC COASTS.

One of the proposals, Dynamic Flight Envelope Assessment and Prediction"" (proposal number 07-IRAC-07-0034) submitted by The Boeing Company (DBA Boeing), was selected to support the Aviation Safety Program, and in particular the Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control (IRAC) Project.  The primary goal of the Dynamic Flight Envelope Assessment and Prediction program is to provide NASA with flight safety enhancement through a process to identify fault damage anomalies in air-vehicle structure, predict an allowable flight maneuver loads envelope for the damaged vehicle, and measure changes in structure dynamics mode shapes due to the damage. The system will also provide adaptive control to maintain the aircraft within the structure limits and suppress any adverse structure dynamic mode interaction with the flight control system. The program's primary focus is on Control-Centric Modeling, combining rigid body models with dynamic flexible structure and loads models to provide the basis for on-line adaptive control of the structure properties of the aircraft. Program products will be algorithms and processes that can provide control of structures properties for tactical and transport aircraft. This program addresses system anomalies caused by battle damage to military aircraft and structure failures to civil aircraft caused by incidents such as fatigue, corrosion, mid-air collisions, or improper procedures. The program builds on the NASA Intelligent Flight Control System technology, already demonstrated on a research F-15 for adaptive control of the aerodynamic capability of a damaged aircraft. The significance of this program is to add a capability by using adaptive control to prevent excessive structure loads or dynamic interaction, thereby increasing the safety and survivability of air and space vehicles. The program will assist NASA on meeting the objectives of the NASA Aviation Safety Program. This program addresses IRAC Topic 1.3, Dynamic Flight Envelope Assessment and Prediction.   This acquisition will result in a three year Cost-plus-Fixed-Fee contract to be conducted by The Boeing Company, Phantom Works division, St. Louis, MO for a total amount of $1,127,367.  """,,,,

THE PRSEUS DESIGN APPROACH IS PART OF THE ERA EFFORT TO ADDRESS FUEL BURN (C02 EMISSIONS) BY REDUCING THE WEIGHT OF ADVANCED STRUCTURES.  REDUCING FUEL BURN REDUCES THE NEED TO USE RESOURCES AND REDUCES POLLUTION.  PRSEUS REPRESENTS A NEW CONCEPT IN COMPOSITE DESIGN THEORY AND MANUFACTURING METHODS.  IT IS A CONSCIOUS PROGRESSION AWAY FROM CONVENTIONAL LAMINATED AND BONDED ASSEMBLIES TOWARD LARGER ONE-PIECE PANEL DESIGNS WITH SEAMLESS TRANSITIONS AND DAMAGE-ARREST INTERFACES SUCH AS STITCH ROWS AND TEAR STRAPS.  IT FOCUSES ON A NEW STRUCTURAL CONCEPT THAT INTEGRATES SKIN, STRINGERS, AND FRAME ELEMENTS INTO A SINGLE LARGE PANEL IN WHICH ALL ELEMENTS ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY CURED (OR CO-CURED) IN ONE HIGH-TEMPERATURE CURE CYCLE.  THE RESULTING STRUCTURE IS A NOVEL SOLUTION FOR ADDRESSING THE DEMANDING FUSELAGE LOADING REQUIREMENTS INHERENT IN A PRESSURIZED SHAPED VEHICLE   LIKE THE HYBRID WING BODY (HWB) CONCEPT.  THE PRSEUS CONCEPT BUILDS UPON, EXTENDS, AND TAILORS THESE STRUCTURAL TECHNOLOGIES IN ORDER TO MEET THE DEMANDING CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH VEHICLES WITH SHAPES AND LOAD PATHS DIFFERENT FROM TODAY S TRADITIONAL WING AND CIRCULAR FUSELAGE STRUCTURES.  HAVING DEMONSTRATED THE UNIQUE CAPABILITY OF THE HWB PRSEUS STRUCTURAL CONCEPT TO ECONOMICALLY PRODUCE LARGE INTEGRATED STRUCTURAL PANELS, THE PRIMARY AIRFRAME DESIGN CHALLENGE NOW BECOMES THE VALIDATION OF THE STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE IN THE COMBINED LOADING ENVIRONMENT OF THE HWB PRESSURE SHELL. UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, SKIN PANELS MUST NOT ONLY HAVE CONTINUOUS LOAD PATHS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS (I.E., NX AND NY), THEY MUST ALSO BE EFFECTIVE IN TRANSMITTING INTERNAL PRESSURE LOADS (I.E., NZ) FOR THE NEAR-FLAT PANEL GEOMETRY.  DEMONSTRATION OF THIS CAPABILITY IS THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE MULTI-BAY BOX TEST ARTICLE.  LARC WILL SUBJECT THE MULTI-BAY BOX TEST ARTICLE TO A SERIES OF TESTS IN THE COMBINED LOADS TEST SYSTEM (COLTS) TEST FACILITY AT LARC.  AMONG OTHER CONDITIONS, THE LARGE LOADING PLATENS IN COLTS WILL BE USED TO IMPART A BENDING MOMENT ON THE TEST ARTICLE AS IT IS SIMULTANEOUSLY PRESSURIZED.  THIS NONLINEAR DESIGN REGIME WILL BE USED TO DEMONSTRATE THE STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE OF THE PRSEUS CONCEPT, SO THAT THE WEIGHT PENALTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE NON-CIRCULAR HWB PRESSURE CABIN CAN BE QUANTITATIVELY ASSESSED.

NASA HAS PARTICIPATED WITH OTHER NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IN A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS TO EVALUATE THE STATE OF THE ART IN COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS (CFD) PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY FOR AEROSPACE VEHICLES.  ONE OF THESE WORKSHOPS THAT STARTED IN 1999 IS THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF AERONAUTICS AND ASTRONAUTICS (AIAA) DRAG PREDICTION WORKSHOP (DPW) SERIES.  THE ORGANIZING COMMITTEE OF DPW SERIES IDENTIFIED PREDICTION OF TURBULENT SEPARATED JUNCTURE FLOW AS A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR IMPROVING THE PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY OF TRANSONIC AEROSPACE VEHICLES.  FIVE WORKSHOPS OVER MORE THAN A DECADE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE UNCERTAINTY IN SEPARATION PREDICTION IS AFFECTED BY THE GRID TOPOLOGY, GRID DENSITY, AND TURBULENCE MODEL.  HOWEVER, THERE IS INSUFFICIENT EXPERIMENTAL DATA TO DETERMINE WHICH PREDICTIONS OF THE SEPARATION REGION ARE CORRECT AND WHY OTHER PREDICTIONS ARE NOT CORRECT.  MODERN AEROSPACE VEHICLES HAVE MANY JUNCTURE REGIONS.  AIRPLANES HAVE SIMILAR JUNCTURE FLOWS AT THE WING-BODY, HORIZONTAL TAIL-BODY, VERTICAL TAIL-BODY, WING-PYLON, NACELLE-PYLON, AND FLAP TRACK FAIRING-WING JUNCTURES.  NEXT GENERATION CONFIGURATIONS SUCH AS THE TRUSS-BRACED WING HAVE EVEN LARGER JUNCTURE REGIONS.  THE ABILITY TO PREDICT THE ONSET AND PROGRESSION OF SEPARATION FLOW IN THESE JUNCTURE REGIONS IS CRITICAL TO ACCURATE PREDICTION OF FORCES AND MOMENTS AND THEREFORE CRITICAL TO DESIGN OF FUEL EFFICIENT AND QUIET AIRCRAFT.  ADDITIONALLY, SPACE LAUNCH VEHICLES HAVE SIMILAR JUNCTURE REGIONS.  THE DPW ORGANIZING COMMITTEE DISCUSSED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A UNIT TEST PROBLEM TO PROVIDE VALIDATION DATA FOR CFD PREDICTIONS OF THE JUNCTURE FLOW.  THE ORGANIZING COMMITTEE IDENTIFIED A CONFIGURATION WITH A LIGHTLY LOADED, SHORT WING SPAN THAT COULD BE SCALED LARGE ENOUGH TO ALLOW ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS OF THE MEAN AND TURBULENT FLOW IN THE SEPARATION REGION.  THE VALIDATION TEST WOULD UTILIZE A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE INTERNALLY MOUNTED LASER DOPPLER VELOCIMETRY (LDV) SYSTEM TO MEASURE THE FLOW NEAR THE FUSELAGE AND WING SURFACES IN THE SEPARATED REGION, STATIC PRESSURE PORTS, AND UNSTEADY PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS.  THE WING WOULD BE DESIGNED TO HAVE A PRESSURE GRADIENT SIMILAR TO NASAS COMMON RESEARCH MODEL (CRM) GEOMETRY, WHICH IS AN OPEN GEOMETRY REPRESENTATIVE OF MODERN IN-SERVICE COMMERCIAL TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT.  FURTHER, THE VALIDATION TEST CONFIGURATION WOULD HAVE TWO PLANES OF SYMMETRY: LEFT-RIGHT AND TOP-BOTTOM ALLOWING MULTIPLE ROTATION ANGLES IN THE EXPERIMENTAL TEST MATRIX TO PROVIDE ESTIMATES OF TUNNEL EFFECTS.  MULTIPLE PLANES OF SYMMETRY ARE POWERFUL TOOLS FOR VALIDATION EXPERIMENTS.  THE VALIDATION TEST WILL BE DESIGNED WITH FOUR FLOW TYPES: 1) ATTACHED FLOW, 2) INCIPIENT SEPARATION, 3) SMALL WING-BODY SEPARATION, AND 4) LARGE SCALE SEPARATION.    BOEING, AS PART OF THE DPW ORGANIZING COMMITTEE, DEVELOPED A DESIGN OF A JUNCTURE FLOW MODEL.  THIS FIRST DESIGN WAS DETERMINED TO BE INSUFFICIENT TO MOUNT THE INTERNAL INSTRUMENTATION, AND BOEING SUBSEQUENTLY PROVIDED AN UPDATED DESIGN TO THE DPW ORGANIZING COMMITTEE.  ANALYSIS OF THIS MODEL AT NASA LANGLEY IDENTIFIED THAT THE MODEL DID NOT PROVIDE THE FOUR FLOW TYPES, THE FUSELAGE WAS TOO NARROW TO ACCOMMODATE THE INTERNAL INSTRUMENTATION AND TRAVERSE SYSTEM, AND THE EXIT AREA OF THE FUSELAGE WAS TOO SMALL TO ACCOMMODATE ALL OF THE INSTRUMENTATION CABLING THAT WAS REQUIRED.  THE WORK DESCRIBED IN THIS TASK ORDER IS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH AN OPEN, PUBLIC-DOMAIN GEOMETRY FOR THE OUTER MOLD LINE OF THE JUNCTURE FLOW MODEL THAT ADDRESSES THE ISSUES WITH THE PREVIOUS DESIGN.

THREE MAIN FOCUS AREAS, OR TECHNICAL CHALLENGES, HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY NASA AND INDUSTRY AS HAVING MAJOR IMPACT ON THE CURRENT CERTIFICATION TIMELINE.  THE ACP THIRD TECHNICAL CHALLENGE (TC3), MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND SIMULATION, IS CONCERNED WITH REDUCING THE OCCURRENCE OF DEFECTS WHICH COMMONLY OCCUR IN AEROSPACE COMPOSITE STRUCTURES AS A RESULT OF THE PROCESSING METHODS UTILIZED TO FABRICATE THESE LARGE, HIGHLY COMPLEX VEHICLES.  ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES IN TC3 IS TO DEVELOP PHYSICS-BASED PROCESS MODELS WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF ACCURATELY PREDICTING THE FORMATION OF DEFECTS DURING ROBOTIC, AUTOMATED FIBER PLACEMENT (AFP) OF COMPOSITE STRUCTURE.  WHILE THE EFFICIENCY DEMONSTRATED IN AFP HAS LED TO ITS ADOPTION BY THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY FOR FABRICATION OF AIRCRAFT FUSELAGE, WING, AND ENGINE NACELLE PRIMARY COMPOSITE STRUCTURES, THE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY REALIZED DUE TO THE OCCURRENCE OF PERFORMANCE REDUCING DEFECTS WHICH RESULT IN COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING REWORK.   THE DEVELOPMENT OF ACCURATE AFP PROCESS MODELS WILL GIVE AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS THE ABILITY TO PREDICT DEFECTS WHICH OCCUR DUE TO THE PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MATERIAL, THE PART TOOLING, AND THE AFP PROCESSING PARAMETERS.  THIS SCIENCE-BASED APPROACH TO MAXIMIZING PART QUALITY HAS PROVEN SUCCESSFUL IN OTHER COMPOSITE PROCESSING METHODOLOGIES SUCH AS INFUSION FLOW PREDICTION AND CURE PROCESS DEFECTS SUCH AS RESIDUAL STRESS.  HOWEVER, CURRENTLY NO VALIDATED PHYSICS-BASED PROCESS MODEL EXISTS TO PREDICT DEFECTS SUCH AS FIBER / TAPE BUCKLING, ALSO REFERRED TO AS FIBER WAVINESS, WRINKLING, PUCKERING, OR WINDOW-SHADING.  AN AFP PROCESS MODEL WHICH ACCURATELY PREDICTS PROCESS DEFECTS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE TRIAL AND ERROR FABRICATION EFFORT REQUIRED TO MEET PRODUCTION CERTIFICATION OF AEROSPACE COMPOSITE STRUCTURE.    THE WORK DESCRIBED IN THIS SOW IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS FABRICATION ISSUES THAT HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE TIMELINE REQUIRED TO CERTIFY COMPOSITE STRUCTURES. THE INTENTION OF THIS TASK ORDER IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE AFP PROCESS PARAMETERS DURING THE FABRICATION OF PARTS WHICH IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO CONTAIN DEFECTS SUCH AS WRINKLING OR PUCKERING. THE GOVERNMENT WILL UTILIZE A WELL CHARACTERIZED AEROSPACE TOUGHENED EPOXY MATERIAL, HEXCEL IM7 / 8552-1 PREPREG, SO THAT THE CHARACTERIZATION STUDY IS FOCUSED ON THE AFP PLACEMENT PARAMETERS WHICH AFFECT THE FORMATION OF THE WRINKLING / PUCKERING DEFECTS. THESE PROCESSING PARAMETERS, FOR EXAMPLE, INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: PLACEMENT SPEED, COMPACTION LOAD, MATERIAL TEMPERATURE, AND/OR HEAD TURNING RADIUS. THE GEOMETRY USED TO EVALUATE THE VARIOUS AFP PROCESSING PARAMETERS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE TYPE AND FORM WHICH HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN PREVIOUS BUILDS BY THE FABRICATOR TO RESULT IN FORMATION OF THE WRINKLING / PUCKERING DEFECTS. THE RESULTS OF THIS AFP PROCESSING CHARACTERIZATION EFFORT WILL BE UTILIZED IN THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF AN AFP PHYSICS-BASED PROCESS MODEL TO PREDICT THESE TYPES OF DEFECTS.  2.0	SCOPE&OBJECTIVE(S):  2.1	THE SCOPE OF THIS TASK ORDER IS TO FABRICATE COMPOSITE PANELS USING THE AFP PROCESS AND CHARACTERIZE THE AFP PROCESS BY MEASURING THE PROCESSING PARAMETERS WHICH RESULT IN FIBER / TAPE BUCKLING DEFECTS (WRINKLING / PUCKERING).        2.2	THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS TASK ORDER ARE TO:  A.

CURRENTLY, THE MOST THOROUGH APPROACH IS TO EVALUATE VAST LIBRARIES OF SEQUENCES USING NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING. BY ASSIGNING A RELATIVE ACTIVITY (FITNESS) TO EACH SEQUENCE, IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONSTRUCT EMPIRICAL FITNESS LANDSCAPES. THESE LANDSCAPES CAN BE IMAGINED IN THREE DIMENSIONS, WITH THE X-Y-PLANE REPRESENTING NUCLEOTIDE CHANGES (GENOTYPE SPACE), AND THE Z-AXIS REPRESENTING RNA FITNESS. HOWEVER, FOR A GIVEN RNA SEQUENCE, THIS FITNESS VALUE WILL CHANGE IF THE CONDITIONS OF THE EXPERIMENT CHANGE (ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE). IMPORTANTLY, ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES MAY PROMOTE ADAPTATION, FOR EXAMPLE, IF LOW FITNESS VALLEYS BECOME CROSSABLE WHEN THE LANDSCAPE CHANGES.

DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL FLUCTUATIONS FOR RNA FITNESS LANDSCAPES, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FITNESS LANDSCAPES AND CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT REMAINS UNDERSTUDIED.

THIS RESEARCH WILL ADVANCE OUR ABILITY TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE THE CAPACITY OF RNA CENTERED LIFE TO ADAPT TO NEW AND CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS. METHODOLOGY AS A MODEL SYSTEM, WE WILL USE GROUP I RIBOZYMES. THESE RIBOZYME CAN CATALYZE A REVERSE-SPLICING REACTION THAT RESULTS IN A SUBSTRATE SEQUENCE BECOMING ATTACHED TO ITS 3 END. WE WILL USE THIS ATTACHED SEQUENCE TO SELECT MOLECULES THAT HAVE REACTED. BY COUNTING THE POPULATION FREQUENCY OF A SPECIFIC SEQUENCE BEFORE AND AFTER SELECTION, WE WILL CALCULATE RIBOZYME FITNESS. FOR OUR MODEL ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENT, WE WILL USE MAGNESIUM ION CONCENTRATION. GROUP I RIBOZYMES SHOW A SIGMOIDAL RESPONSE TO INCREASING MG2+ CONCENTRATION THAT CAN BE FIT BY THE HILL EQUATION. DIFFERENT VARIANTS SHOW MAGNESIUM DEPENDENT RESPONSES THAT DIFFER IN BOTH THE INFLECTION POINT AND THE HILL COEFFICIENT, BUT PREVIOUS WORK HAS BEEN LIMITED TO A FEW SEQUENCES. WE WILL CONSTRUCT A LIBRARY OF SEQUENCE NEIGHBORS, AND DETERMINE THE RELATIVE ACTIVITY OF EACH SEQUENCE UNDER 10 DIFFERENT MAGNESIUM CONCENTRATIONS THAT COVER THE EXPECTED RESPONSE CURVES. FOR EACH SEQUENCE VARIANT, WE WILL FIT THE MG2+ RESPONSE CURVE TO THE HILL EQUATION AND EXTRACT THE FIT PARAMETERS. WE WILL THEN MAP THESE PARAMETERS BACK TO SEQUENCE SPACE AND DETERMINE THE CHANGE IN MAGNESIUM DEPENDENCE CAUSED BY CHANGES IN THE NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE. WE DEVELOP EVOLUTIONARY SIMULATIONS TO PREDICT HOW POPULATIONS OF RNA MOLECULES WOULD ADAPT TO CONSTANT OR FLUCTUATING MAGNESIUM LEVELS.

WE WILL USE SNOWEX􀁁S GROUND-BASED TERRESTRIAL LIDAR (TLS) AND AIRBORNE LIDAR FROM THE AIRBORNE SNOW OBSERVATORY (ASO) ALONG WITH SNOWEX SNOW PIT, SNOW TRANSECT, AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS, TO QUANTIFY THE IN- AND SUB-CANOPY SNOW DISTRIBUTION FROM FINE (INDIVIDUAL BRANCHES AND TREES) TO COARSE (LANDSCAPE) SCALES.

Q2. HOW DO IN- AND SUB-CANOPY SNOW DEPTH DISTRIBUTIONS CHANGE WITH CANOPY CHARACTERISTICS AND FORCING MECHANISMS (E.G. FROM WINDDOMINATED TO INTERCEPTION- AND LONGWAVE ABLATION-DOMINATED) AND HOW DO THESE RELATIONSHIPS/DISTRIBUTIONS CHANGE WITH SPATIAL SCALE? Q3. WHAT PARAMETERIZATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO IMPROVE HOW SNOW MODELS REPRESENT IN- AND SUB-CANOPY SNOW DISTRIBUTIONS ACROSS HETEROGENEOUS CANOPY CONDITIONS AND FORCING MECHANISMS? THE RESULTS OF THIS PROJECT AREA VITAL TO NASA􀁁S GLOBAL SNOW MISSION IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. FIRST OUR STUDY ADDRESSES THE KEY KNOWLEDGE GAP OF HOW WELL AND WITH WHAT UNCERTAINTY DO AIRBORNE TECHNIQUES CAPTURE IN- AND SUB-CANOPY SNOW DEPTH DISTRIBUTIONS ACROSS CANOPIES WITH DIFFERENT DENSITIES AND VARYING FORCING MECHANISMS.

ACTIVE AND PASSIVE MICROWAVE GBRS INSTRUMENTS HAVE SMALL FOOTPRINTS WHICH REMOVE THE COMPLEXITIES OF SUB-PIXEL HETEROGENEITY, AND ALLOW HIGH-RESOLUTION SPATIAL OBSERVATIONS TO BE USED TO STUDY SCALING EFFECTS. THEY ALSO CAN BE OPERATED CONTINUOUSLY FROM A TOWER, PROVIDING A TEMPORAL CONTEXT FOR SNAP-SHOT AIRBORNE AND SPACEBORNE MICROWAVE MEASUREMENTS. THIS PROJECT WILL LEVERAGE LARGE SPATIOTEMPORAL DATABASES OF GROUND-BASED REMOTE SENSING (GBRS) AND IN-SITU OBSERVATIONS COLLECTED AS PART OF NUMEROUS SNOW REMOTE SENSING EFFORTS (NASA CLPX-II, CLPX-III, WISM, SNOWEX, ESA COREH2O, CRYOSAT). DATABASES WERE COLLECTED USING GROUND-BASED MICROWAVE RADARS AND RADIOMETERS, COVERING A WIDE RANGE OF SENSOR PARAMETERS AND IN A WIDE RANGE OF WELL-CHARACTERIZED SNOWPACK CONDITIONS, SPANNING THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF SNOW COMMONLY OBSERVED IN BOTH MOUNTAINOUS AND ARCTIC ENVIRONMENTS. THIS PROJECT IS LOW RISK AND OFFERS A LARGE BENEFIT AT LOW COST AS THE DATA HAVE ALREADY BEEN COLLECTED. THIS WORK WILL RESULT IN SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF GMRS AND IN-SITU DATASETS COVERING THE RANGE OF SNOW CLIMATES, WILL DEFINE REQUIREMENTS FOR FIELD SITES FOR FUTURE SNOW REMOTE SENSING EFFORTS, AND WILL DESIGN OPTIMAL SAMPLING STRATEGIES THAT DEPEND ON SITE LOCATION AND TIME OF YEAR.",,,,

A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IN STELLAR ASTROPHYSICS IS HOW STARS SHED THE BULK OF THEIR MASS AS THEY DIE. MUCH OF THIS MASS IS EJECTED DURING THE LPV PHASE OF STELLAR EVOLUTION. THAT MATERIAL, ENRICHED BY THE NUCLEOSYNTHETIC PRODUCTS CREATED DEEP IN A STARS INTERIOR, IS RECYCLED INTO THE INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM TO FORM THE NEXT GENERATIONS OF STARS AND PLANETS AND, OVER TIME, CHANGES THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE GALAXY. THE AMPLITUDE AND PERIOD DISTRIBUTION OF LPVS, AND HOW LONG THEY REMAIN IN THIS STAGE, PROFOUNDLY IMPACT THE TYPE AND AMOUNT OF ENRICHED MATERIAL THAT IS RETURNED TO THE ISM. HOWEVER, A PROFOUND IMPEDIMENT TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS IMPORTANT PHASE OF STELLAR EVOLUTION IS THE LACK OF AN UNBIASED SAMPLE FOR THE DISK OF THE MILKY WAY. RECENT VARIABILITY SURVEYS OF THE MAGELLANIC CLOUDS AND THE GALACTIC BULGE HAVE ACCURATELY COUNTED LPVS IN THOSE ENVIRONMENTS AS A FUNCTION OF LUMINOSITY, PULSATION MODE, AND PERIOD BUT NO SUITABLE COMPARISON EXISTS FOR THE GALACTIC DISK. CURRENT COUNTS OF GALACTIC LPVS ARE FROM HETEROGENEOUS COMPILATIONS OF COUNTLESS OBSERVING PROGRAMS, EACH WITH ITS OWN BIASES. CONSEQUENTLY, THE IMPACT OF THESE POPULATIONS OF EVOLVED STARS ON THEIR HOST GALAXIES AT SOLAR METALLICITIES REMAINS UNKNOWN.  OUR PROJECT WILL USE THE FFIS FROM THE KEPLER ARCHIVE TO ADDRESS THIS NEED BY CREATING THE FIRST UNBIASED CATALOG OF DISK LPVS AND ANALYZING THEIR PROPERTIES. THESE IMAGES OF THE ENTIRE 116 SQUARE DEGREE FIELD, TAKEN AT A CADENCE OF ABOUT ONCE EVERY 30 DAYS, MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE FIRST TIME TO CREATE AN UNBIASED DATABASE OF PULSATING, DYING STARS ON THE ASYMPTOTIC GIANT BRANCH IN THE DISK. WE WILL CREATE AN ATLAS OF 1500 DAY LIGHT CURVES TO CHARACTERIZE THEIR VARIABILITY AND MASS-LOSS PROPERTIES AND TO ENABLE THEIR COMPARISON TO POPULATIONS OF EVOLVED STARS IN THE GALACTIC BULGE AND MAGELLANIC CLOUDS. WE WILL EXTRACT THE POINT SOURCES FROM EACH FULL FIELD AND CROSS CORRELATE THE SOURCES ACROSS THE MONTHLY EPOCHS TO CREATE LIGHT CURVES AND CALIBRATE THE STELLAR FLUXES; AND SELECT CANDIDATE VARIABLES. FOR THE CANDIDATE VARIABLES, WE WILL QUANTIFY THE PULSATION STRENGTHS AND PERIODS AND CROSS CORRELATE WITH INFRARED DATA FROM 2MASS, WISE, AND SPITZER TO CHARACTERIZE THEIR DUST; DETERMINE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES INCLUDING MASS LOSS RATES, LUMINOSITIES, AND DISTANCES; AND INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE LPV POPULATION ON THE MILKY WAY.

IN FACT, THE SHORT WAVELENGTH ENDS OF THE IRS SPECTRA HAVE NEVER BEEN PINNED DOWN TO ANY MEASURED PHOTOMETRY. ADDITIONALLY, A SYSTEMATIC ISSUE DUE TO MIS-CENTERINGS WITHIN THE IRS SLIT CAUSES FLUX LOSSES IN THE SPECTRA, ESPECIALLY AT THE BLUE END, AND THIS WAS NEVER FULLY RESOLVED DURING THE CRYOGENIC PHASE OF THE MISSION.

A RIGOROUS UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHENOLOGY OF CARBON CYCLING IN EVERGREEN BOREAL FORESTS HAS BEEN CHALLENGING WITH TRADITIONAL VEGETATION INDICES SUCH AS NDVI AND EVI, BECAUSE THEY RETAIN FOLIAGE AND REMAIN GREEN YEAR-ROUND, BUT THE LIGHT USE EFFICIENCY (LUE) OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS CHANGES RAPIDLY AND DRAMATICALLY. SEASONAL CHANGES IN PIGMENT COMPOSITION ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING LUE CAN BE DETECTED VIA REFLECTANCE (PRI AND CCI) AND PROVIDE INFORMATION ON PLANT PHOTOPROTECTIVE MECHANISMS, BUT THEIR UTILITY FROM SPACE-BORNE PLATFORMS HAS BEEN LIMITED. SOLAR INDUCED FLUORESCENCE (SIF) REFLECTS DYNAMICAL CHANGES ACROSS THE GROWING SEASON DRIVEN BY INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS, AND THUS MAY PROVIDE A CRITICAL TOOL TO EVALUATE ECOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS DRIVING CHANGING GPP. WHILE SPACEBORNE DETECTION OF SIF, PRI, AND CCI HAS YIELDED IMPORTANT INSIGHTS, THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION IS CURRENTLY TOO COARSE TO RESOLVE DETAILED SEASONAL CHANGES. WE PROPOSE TO LINK OBSERVATIONS OF VEGETATION REFLECTANCE AND SIF COLLECTED AT HIGH TEMPORAL RESOLUTION (CONTINUOUS GROUND-BASED HYPERSPECTRAL REFLECTANCE AND SIF WITH CUSTOM PHOTOSPEC SPECTROMETERS) AND HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION (AIRBORNE DATA   CFIS, AVIRISNG) WITH CARBON FLUXES ACROSS A RANGE OF HYDROLOGIC AND CLIMATE REGIMES IN THE NORTHERN BOREAL FOREST.

TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, WE WILL LEVERAGE THE STRENGTH OF BOTH SIF AND REFLECTANCE SYNERGISTICALLY TO INTERPRET THEIR RELATIONS TO GPP, AND DEPENDENCE ON OBSERVATION GEOMETRY. TOWARDS THIS GOAL, WE WILL INSTALL OUR TOWER-BASED SPECTROMETER SYSTEM AT A NEW SITE (DELTA JUNCTION, ALASKA), WHICH WILL BE AUGMENTED BY OUR EXISTING NETWORK, REPRESENTATIVE OF DIFFERENT CLIMATOLOGICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL REGIMES (SITES NIWOT RIDGE, COLORADO; SOUTHERN OLD BLACK SPRUCE, SASKATCHEWAN). THESE THREE EVERGREEN-DOMINATED SITES HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT CLIMATIC, RADIATIVE, AND HYDROLOGICAL REGIMES, WHICH ENABLES US TO CHARACTERIZE MUCH OF THE WIDE RANGE OF EVERGREEN ECOSYSTEMS IN THE ABOVE DOMAIN. TOWER-CANOPY AND AIRBORNE SPECTROSCOPY DATA WILL BE COUPLED WITH IN-SITU  MEASUREMENTS AND 3-D RADIATIVE TRANSFER MODELING TO LINK PROCESSES AT A RANGE OF SCALES TO REMOTE SENSING MEASUREMENTS. THIS MULTI-SCALE APPROACH WILL INFORM SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS FROM MODIS, OCO-2, AND TROPOMI, TO SCALE GPP ESTIMATES ACROSS THE BOREAL REGION. OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVES ARE AS FOLLOWS: 1) ESTABLISH A QUANTITATIVE FRAMEWORK TO DESCRIBE THE ECOPHYSIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL MECHANISMS LINKING SURFACE MEASUREMENTS OF SIF AND VEGETATION REFLECTANCE TO GPP AT ESTABLISHED TOWER SITES AND COINCIDENT AIRBORNE CAMPAIGNS. 2) REDUCE UNCERTAINTIES IN SATELLITE-BASED ESTIMATES OF GPP ACROSS THE BOREAL REGION BY APPLYING A PROCESS-BASED UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH THE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL DYNAMICS OF SIF AND VEGETATION REFLECTANCE AT FINE SCALES.

THE NASA-SUPPORTED MISSIONS HAVE PRODUCED LONG AND ACCURATE DATASETS, WHICH PROVIDE AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY TO INVESTIGATE AND DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN GEOPHYSICAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO SURFACE DEFORMATION, INCLUDING TECTONIC MOTIONS AND THE REDISTRIBUTION OF SURFACE FLUIDS. THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IS DISPLACED IN ELASTIC RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN SURFACE MASS LOADS. SPATIAL GEODETIC OBSERVATIONAL TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS GPS, ACCURATELY MEASURE THE CRUSTAL LOADING DEFORMATION AT MILLIMETER-LEVEL ACCURACY. LOADING DEFORMATION DEPENDS ON BOTH SURFACE-LOAD MASS CHANGES AND THE ELASTIC PROPERTIES OF EARTH S INTERIOR. IF SURFACE-LOAD CHANGE CAN BE PRECISELY DETERMINED, THE RESIDUAL BETWEEN OBSERVED AND MODELED LOADING DEFORMATION MAY BE USED TO INVESTIGATE THE ELASTIC STRUCTURE OF THE EARTH. HERE, WE PROPOSE TO USE OBSERVATIONS OF MASS-LOADING RESPONSE IN THE GREAT LAKES REGION OF NORTH AMERICA TO PROBE THE ELASTIC STRUCTURE OF THE REGIONAL CONTINENTAL SHIELD. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBSURFACE STRUCTURE OF THE GREAT LAKES REGION IN THE NORTH AMERICAN PLATE IS IMPORTANT FOR ALL SOLID EARTH SCIENCES. PREVIOUS SEISMIC TOMOGRAPHY STUDIES INDICATE THAT CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PARTS OF NORTH AMERICA ARE UNDERLAIN BY A RELATIVELY COLD, CRATONIC KEEL EXTENDING TO DEPTHS OF MORE THAN 200 KM WITHIN THE MANTLE. A CONSPICUOUS FEATURE OF SOME RECENT MODELS IS A LOW-VELOCITY CHANNEL AT #tilde#200 KM DEPTH EXTENDING FROM THE EAST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA INTO THE LOWER GREAT LAKES REGION. THE DEVIATIONS OF THE REGIONAL EARTH STRUCTURE IN THE GREAT LAKES REGION FROM STANDARD GLOBALLY AVERAGED EARTH STRUCTURE WILL AFFECT THE EARTH S LOADING RESPONSE TO VARIATIONS IN SURFACE MASS. CORRECTLY CHARACTERIZING THE REGIONAL EARTH STRUCTURE WILL IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF THE NORTH AMERICAN PLATE. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL SYSTEMATICALLY ANALYZE GPS-OBSERVED LOADING DEFORMATION AROUND THE GREAT LAKES REGION, AND DEVELOP AN INVERSION STRATEGY TO BETTER CONSTRAIN THE EARTH STRUCTURE IN A CENTRAL REGION OF THE NORTH AMERICAN PLATE. CHANGES IN LAKE VOLUME ARE KNOWN RELATIVELY ACCURATELY BY WATER-LEVEL MONITORING STATIONS, SO WE WILL FOCUS ON LAKE-MASS CHANGES FOR THE TOMOGRAPHIC INVESTIGATIONS.

THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK ALSO CONTROLS MANY OTHER ASPECTS OF HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY, PERTURBATION OF WHICH WILL AFFECT LONGER-TERM HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE TIMING OF THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK IS MEASURED ROUTINELY, AS A STANDARD MEASURE OF HEALTH AND BEHAVIOR, DURING LONG-DURATION SPACE MISSIONS TO ENSURE THAT THESE MULTIPLE BRAIN AND BODY SYSTEMS ARE NOT DISRUPTED AND MISALIGNED FROM EITHER EACH OTHER (INTERNAL DESYNCHRONIZATION) OR WITH THE WORK SCHEDULE (EXTERNAL DESYNCHRONIZATION). ONCE MEASURED, AND IF OUT OF PHASE, CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS CAN BE RESYNCHRONIZED TO THE DESIRED TIME USING A NUMBER OF COUNTERMEASURES, INCLUDING BRIGHT LIGHT, MELATONIN, AND POTENTIALLY EXERCISE AND MEAL TIMING. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE COUNTERMEASURES DEPENDS CRITICALLY, HOWEVER, ON THE CIRCADIAN PHASE AT WHICH THEY ARE ADMINISTERED MISTIMED COUNTERMEASURES CAN EXACERBATE CIRCADIAN DISRUPTION, LEADING TO WORSENING OF HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES RATHER THAN IMPROVEMENT. CIRCADIAN PHASE IS HIGHLY INDIVIDUALIZED, HOWEVER, VARYING BY UP TO 5 HOURS IN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS UNDER STABLE CONDITIONS, AND IS EVEN MORE VARIABLE IN SPACE. TO DATE, NO FEASIBLE METHOD EXISTS TO MEASURE CIRCADIAN PHASE ACCURATELY AND RELIABLY IN REAL-TIME DURING SPACEFLIGHT. EXISTING METHODS CURRENTLY BEING USED IN-FLIGHT REQUIRE COLLECTION OF SERIAL URINE SAMPLES FOR UP TO 48 HOURS, FROM WHICH THE CONCENTRATION OF THE URINARY METABOLITE 6-SULPHATOXYMELATONIN IS MEASURED TO DETERMINE THE TIMING OF THE CIRCADIAN RHYTHM. IMPORTANTLY, HOWEVER, NO TECHNOLOGY EXISTS TO MEASURE CONCENTRATIONS OF URINARY 6-SULPHATOXYMELATONIN DIRECTLY IN-FLIGHT THEREFORE, KNOWLEDGE ABOUT IN-FLIGHT CIRCADIAN DISRUPTION CAN BE DETERMINED ONLY DURING POST-HOC ANALYSES ONCE THE SAMPLES HAVE BEEN RETURNED TO EARTH, WHICH LIMITS THE ABILITY TO TREAT CIRCADIAN DISRUPTION IN REAL TIME.

THE SUCCESSFUL VALIDATION OF THIS APPROACH WILL ENABLE CIRCADIAN PHASE TO BE MEASURED IN REAL-TIME DURING SPACEFLIGHT WITH MINIMAL BURDEN TO THE CREW SUCH THAT COUNTERMEASURES TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CIRCADIAN MISALIGNMENT CAN BE TAILORED TO INDIVIDUAL CREWMEMBERS NEEDS, THEREBY ENHANCING THE SAFETY, PERFORMANCE, AND WELL-BEING OF ALL CREWMEMBERS DURING SPACEFLIGHT.",,,,

IN SUCH A HIGH-RISK ENVIRONMENT, THE RISK OF SLEEPINESS-RELATED PERFORMANCE IMPAIRMENT MUST BE MINIMIZED. IT IS ALSO INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED THAT THE RESPONSE TO SLEEP LOSS AND CIRCADIAN DESYNCHRONY IS HIGHLY INDIVIDUALIZED AND BOTH CHALLENGE- AND TASK-DEPENDENT. THIS HIGH DEGREE OF INTER-INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHO WILL BE AT RISK AND WHEN THEY WILL BE AT RISK, AND THEREFORE A `ONE-SIZEFITS-ALL  APPROACH IS LIKELY TO BE SUBOPTIMAL. WHAT IS NEEDED ARE BIOMARKERS OF INDIVIDUAL VULNERABILITIES AND RESILIENCIES TO SLEEP LOSS AND CIRCADIAN DESYNCHRONIZATION THAT CAN BE USED TO PREDICT PROBLEMS AND INTERVENE WHEN NECESSARY.

IN A RECENT NASA EVIDENCE REVIEW ADDRESSING HRP SLEEP GAP4, WE IDENTIFIED AND EVALUATED APPROXIMATELY 80 POTENTIAL BIOMARKERS OF RESPONSE TO SLEEP LOSS OR CIRCADIAN DESYNCHRONY, RANGING FROM SIMPLE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENTS OF ALERTNESS THROUGH TO GENETIC POLYMORPHISMS. WHILE THERE ARE FEW DATA SPECIFICALLY CHARACTERIZING INDIVIDUAL RESPONSES TO SLEEP LOSS AND CIRCADIAN DESYNCHRONY, FORTUNATELY, MANY OF THESE BIOMARKERS HAVE BEEN STUDIED BY OUR RESEARCH GROUP IN DETAILED LABORATORY CONDITIONS OF THOUSANDS OF SUBJECTS OVER TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BED-DAYS IN FEDERALLY-FUNDED STUDIES, BUT HAVE NEVER BEEN EXAMINED WITH RESPECT TO INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES. FURTHERMORE, IN A PREVIOUS NASA-SUPPORTED STUDY (ROSES-2008), WE STUDIED 51 ANTARCTIC EXPEDITIONERS OVER 6 MONTHS DURING THE ANTARCTIC WINTER (MARCH TO SEPTEMBER) AT AUSTRALIAN ANTARCTIC STATIONS CASEY, DAVIS AND MAWSON (54% OF THE OVERWINTERING POPULATION).

THE LARGE DATASET IS AVAILABLE TO TEST THE PREDICTIVE VALUE OF A RANGE OF BEHAVIORAL, PERFORMANCE, SLEEP AND CIRCADIAN BIOMARKERS ON NEUROCOGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND GOING FORWARD, WILL ALLOW OUR RESEARCH TEAM, IN COLLABORATION WITH HRP, TO SELECT ONLY THOSE MEASURES THAT YIELD SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION FOR FUTURE STUDY, AND WILL ALLOW CAPACITY TO ADD NEW MEASURES NOT YET ASSESSED UNDER THESE OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS. BASED ON THIS REVIEW, WE HAVE DEVISED A PROTOCOL TO ASSESS THE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF A CORE SET OF THESE BIOMARKERS TO PREDICT NEUROCOGNITIVE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO THE SLEEP DEPRIVATION AND CIRCADIAN MISALIGNMENT INHERENT IN ISS OPERATIONS. FIRST, WE WILL IDENTIFY CANDIDATE BIOMARKERS FROM OUR LABORATORY ANALOG, WHERE INDIVIDUALS ARE HOUSED IN INDIVIDUAL, SEMI-ISOLATED, WINDOW-LESS SUITES, AND FROM EXISTING EXTENSIVE LONGITUDINAL DATA IN OVER 50 ANTARCTIC EXPEDITIONERS.

SPACEFLIGHT IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH SHORT SLEEP (ONLY 6H/NIGHT) AND SO EVEN IN NON-SHIFTED SETTINGS, SUCH CHRONIC SLEEP DEFICIENCY WILL LEAD TO IMPAIRED PERFORMANCE. RECENTLY, WE AND OTHERS HAVE SHOWN THAT SHORT-WAVELENGTH (BLUE) LIGHT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAVELENGTH FOR ENHANCING ALERTNESS AND PERFORMANCE DIRECTLY, AND FOR PHASE-SHIFTING THE CIRCADIAN PACEMAKER. LIGHT THEREFORE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE A SAFE, NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL COUNTERMEASURE TO REDUCE THE RISK OF PERFORMANCE DEFICITS AND CIRCADIAN MISALIGNMENT DURING SPACE FLIGHT. USING BLUE LIGHT ALONE, HOWEVER, IS UNDESIRABLE AS IT IMPAIRS VISUAL FUNCTION BUT MANIPULATION OF THE BLUE LIGHT CONTENT OF WHITE LIGHT HAS SIMILAR BENEFITS, AND CAN OPTIMIZE VISUAL AND NON-VISUAL LIGHT RESPONSES SIMULTANEOUSLY. NASA IS REPLACING THE CURRENT LIGHTING ABOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION WITH A NEW SOLID STATE LIGHTING ASSEMBLY (SSLA), INCORPORATING THREE PRE-DETERMINED SETTINGS TO ADDRESS DIFFERENT OPERATIONAL NEEDS: 1) WHITE LIGHT FOR GENERAL VISION; 2) BLUE-ENRICHED HIGH INTENSITY WHITE LIGHT TO ENHANCE ALERTNESS AND CIRCADIAN ADAPTATION; 3) BLUE-DEPLETED LOW INTENSITY WHITE LIGHT TO MINIMIZE ALERTNESS PRIOR TO SLEEP. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A DYNAMIC LIGHTING SCHEDULE (DLS) WHICH DETERMINES WHEN EACH OF THESE THREE SETTINGS WILL BE USED TO OPTIMIZE LIGHTING TO IMPROVE ALERTNESS AND PERFORMANCE, RESET CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS AND ENHANCE SLEEP, WHILE MAINTAINING VISION. LABORATORY-BASED ANALOG STUDIES OF THE DLS ARE ONGOING. THE CURRENT PROPOSAL WILL EXTEND THIS WORK TO APPLY THE DLS IN THE HUMAN EXPLORATION RESEARCH ANALOG(HERA) AS THE NEXT STEP IN EXAMINING THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF THE SSLA SYSTEM, AND TO PROVIDE THE TESTING NECESSARY TO FINALIZE THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES FOR IN-FLIGHT TESTING OF THE NEW LIGHT ABOARD ISS IN 2016.",,,,

EARTH OBSERVATIONS PROVIDE A CRITICAL AND EXPANDING RESOURCE TO THE GROUP ON EARTH OBSERVATIONS (GEO) COMMUNITY AND ARE VITAL TO THE SUCCESS OF ACHIEVING IMPORTANT GEO OBJECTIVES. AS EARTH SCIENCE DATA INCREASE IN AVAILABILITY, FREQUENCY, AND RESOLUTION THERE IS A GROWING NEED FOR FLEXIBLE DATA ANALYSIS ENVIRONMENTS THAT EMPOWER USERS TO EXPLORE, ANALYZE, AND MODEL EARTH OBSERVATION DATA IN A SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE, WEB-BASED ENVIRONMENT.

VALIDATE THE FSW MODEL RESULTS FOR TORQUE, REACTIVE LOAD, AND TEMPERATURES FOR STANDARD FSW TOOLS AND FOR A SELF-REACTING FSW TOOL. IN PRIOR EFFORTS, THE FRICTION LEVEL HAS BEEN AN ADJUSTABLE PARAMETER USED TO \TUNE\"" A FINITE ELEMENT MODEL FOR FSW. HOWEVER, THIS SIMPLE TUNING APPROACH NEGLECTS THE UNDERLYING PHYSICS AT THE INTERFACE, AND DOES NOT PROVIDE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS FOR ALL OF THE CRITICAL PHENOMENA THAT WOULD RENDER THE MODEL TRULY PREDICTIVE AND USEFUL FOR DEVELOPMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE MODEL IS \""TUNED\"" FOR AN ACCURATE PREDICTION OF TEMPERATURES, THEN THE REACTIVE LOAD IS OFTEN OVERESTIMATED. THIS RESULTS IN INACCURATE STRESS PREDICTIONS WITHIN THE PART. THE PHYSICS AND MECHANICS OF HEAT GENERATION AND MATERIAL DEFORMATION AT THE SCALES AND TEMPERATURES AT WHICH THEY OCCUR IN FSW HAS NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY STUDIED AND UNDERSTOOD. WHILE THE FLOW STRESS IN THE BULK MATERIAL CAN BE CHARACTERIZED BY TENSION TESTING, COMPRESSION TESTING, OR TORSION TESTING THE INTERFACE MATERIAL FLOW STRESS UNDERGOES LARGE AMOUNTS OF SHEAR, AND THEREFORE RECRYSTALLIZATION, WHICH CAN DRAMATICALLY INFLUENCE THE LOCAL FLOW STRESS. RATHER THAN TRYING TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE MICROSTRUCTURE EVOLUTION AT THE INTERFACE, OUR APPROACH WILL BE TO DEVELOP A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT THAT WILL ALLOW FOR CHARACTERIZING THE LOCAL FLOW STRESSES AT THE INTERFACE, WHICH ARE THE PRIMARY DATA NEEDED FOR ACCURATE MODELING WITHOUT THE NEED FOR \""TUNING\"" BY FREQUENT ADJUSTMENT OF A FRICTION COEFFICIENT. DATA FROM THE EXPERIMENT WILL BE USED AS INPUT TO AN INVERSE PARAMETER IDENTIFICATION SCHEME THAT WILL PROVIDE LOCAL FLOW STRESSES IN WHAT WE ARE CALLING THE \""HEAT GENERATION ZONE\"" (HGZ). IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH, THE FOLLOWING TASKS WILL BE CARRIED OUT: 1. FLAT, PINLESS FSW TOOLS WILL BE ROTATED AT DIFFERENT RPM AND REACTIVE LOADS IN AA 2219. TWO DIFFERENT TOOLING MATERIALS WILL BE EMPLOYED, IN ORDER TO INTRODUCE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF FRICTION AT THE INTERFACE. THERMOCOUPLES WILL BE EMBEDDED IN THE AL PLATE TO MEASURE TEMPERATURES NEAR THE INTERFACE. THEY WILL ALSO BE EMBEDDED IN THE TOOL. DATA COMING OUT OF THE EXPERIMENT WILL BE TORQUE, REACTIVE LOAD, AND TEMPERATURES IN THE PLATE AND THE TOOL. 2. A FINITE ELEMENT MODEL OF THE FLAT, PINLESS TOOL EXPERIMENT WILL BE DEVELOPED AND COUPLED WITH AN INVERSE PARAMETER ANALYSIS ALGORITHM TO MODEL THE LOCAL FLOW STRESSES IN THE HGZ. 3. THE LOCAL FLOW STRESS RELATIONSHIP FROM TASK #2 WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO AN EULERIAN FINITE ELEMENT MODEL OF FSW, DEVELOPED IN PRIOR EFFORTS BY THE PIS. 4. THE FSW MODEL WILL BE VALIDATED BY EXPERIMENTS, SUCH THAT TEMPERATURES, REACTIVE WELDING LOAD, AND WELDING TORQUE ARE ALL PREDICTED, SIMULTANEOUSLY, WITH REASONABLE ACCURACY (5%). INITIAL VALIDATION WILL BE WITH A SMOOTH TOOL. AFTER APPROPRIATE AGREEMENT ON A SMOOTH TOOL, A TOOL WITH A THREADED PIN WILL BE EMPLOYED IN THE MODEL AND VALIDATED BY EXPERIMENT. FINALLY, A SELF-REACTING FSW TOOL WILL BE MODELED AND VALIDATED BY EXPERIMENT. MODEL RESULTS WILL BE USED TO PREDICT MECHANICAL PROPERTIES IN THE HEAT AFFECTED ZONE OF THE WELD. THE PROPOSED APPROACH WOULD PROVIDE NASA WITH A METHOD FOR CHARACTERIZING INTERFACE BEHAVIOR FOR A GIVEN ALLOY AND TOOL MATERIAL. THIS INTERFACE BEHAVIOR IS ESSENTIAL TO ACCURATE MODELING. FSW MODELS USING ACCURATE INTERFACE BEHAVIOR WILL BE MORE PREDICTIVE AND USEFUL FOR THE RAPID OPTIMIZATION OF PROCESS PARAMETERS AND TOOL DESIGNS.""",,,,

NECESSARY SYSTEM ELECTRONICS, SENSITIVE SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS AND ESPECIALLY ASTRONAUTS ONBOARD THE SPACECRAFT MUST OPERATE WITHIN A SPECIFIC TEMPERATURE WINDOW OR THE MISSION WILL FAIL. HOWEVER, THE TENDENCY OF A SPACECRAFT''S TEMPERATURE IS TO INCREASE. THE SUN AND THE EARTH RADIATE HEAT THAT IS ABSORBED INTO THE SPACECRAFT WHILE ON BOARD ELECTRONICS AND PERSONNEL GENERATE HEAT INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT. ON EARTH, THIS EXCESS HEAT WOULD NORMALLY BE REMOVED BY AIR AROUND THE SPACECRAFT. HOWEVER, THE SPACECRAFT IS IN THE VACUUM OF SPACE. AS SUCH, THE HEAT MUST ULTIMATELY BE EMITTED AWAY FROM THE SPACECRAFT AS RADIATION. COMPONENTS DESIGNED TO EMIT THIS EXCESS HEAT ARE CALLED RADIATORS AND ARE A VITAL PART OF THE THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OF ANY SPACECRAFT. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE HEAT LOAD ON A SYSTEM VARIES WITH ORBIT, RADIATORS ARE DESIGNED FOR A WORST CASE HEATING SCENARIO. AS SUCH, ANY HEATING CONFIGURATION OUTSIDE OF THE DESIGNED HEATING SCENARIO CAUSES THE RADIATOR TO BEHAVE IN AN UNDESIRABLE WAY, EMITTING MORE HEAT THAN DESIRED OR ABSORBING TOO MUCH HEAT FROM THE SURROUNDINGS. LIKEWISE, THESE RADIATORS ARE HEAVY, OFTEN COMPRISING 30 - 40 PERCENT OF TOTAL SPACECRAFT WEIGHT. A SIMPLE YET EFFECTIVE SOLUTION, AS DISCUSSED IN THE THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ROADMAP, IS TO DEVELOP A LIGHTWEIGHT RADIATOR WHICH IS ABLE TO MANIPULATE ITS HEAT REJECTION RATE IN REAL TIME.  THIS PROPOSAL DISCUSSES A LIGHT WEIGHT, VARIABLE HEAT REJECTION TECHNOLOGY THAT MAY BE UTILIZED IN MANY APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING THAT OF A DEEP SPACE RADIATOR. A THIN, MIRROR FINISH ALUMINUM FOIL IS FOLDED INTO A SIMPLE, ORIGAMI INSPIRED V GROOVE PATTERN. THIS PATTERN ALLOWS FOR THE FOIL TO BE COMPRESSED, SUCH THAT THE V GROOVES ARE VERY STEEP AND TIGHTLY COMPACTED, OR STRETCHED UNTIL IT RESEMBLES A FLAT SHEET.  AS THE FOIL IS COMPRESSED, THE AMOUNT OF HEAT RADIATED INTO SPACE OR THE AMOUNT OF HEAT ABSORBED IS GREATLY INCREASED. WHEN PULLED FLAT, THE FOIL WILL EMIT AND ABSORB VERY LITTLE RADIATION. THIS VARIABLE HEAT REJECTION CAPABILITY IS USEFUL FOR BOTH RADIATOR AND HEAT SHIELD APPLICATIONS. AS A RADIATOR, THE FOIL WILL GIVE THE USER CONTROL OF HOW MUCH HEAT IS ENTERING OR LEAVING THE SYSTEM. THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY RADIATOR WEIGHT WHILE DELIVERING OPTIMUM HEAT REJECTION PERFORMANCE FOR THE ENTIRE MISSION DURATION. LIKEWISE, THESE FOILS MAY BE USED AS HEAT SHIELDS, PLACED OVER COMPONENTS SENSITIVE TO TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS, SUCH AS CRYOGENIC FLUID TANKS.  WHEN ILLUMINATED BY THE SUN, THE SHIELD CAN ASSUME A FLAT STATE, REFLECTING 98 PERCENT OF THE SUN''S ENERGY AWAY FROM THE SENSITIVE COMPONENT.  UPON ENTERING THE EARTH''S SHADOW, THE SHIELD WILL ASSUME A COMPRESSED STATE, EMITTING EXCESS HEAT ORIGINATING FROM THE SPACECRAFT INTO DEEP SPACE INSTEAD OF REFLECTING THIS HEAT ONTO THE CRYOGENIC FLUID TANK. PRELIMINARY WORK CHARACTERIZING THE BEHAVIOR OF V GROOVES WHEN EXPOSED TO RADIATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED. HOWEVER, THE BULK OF THE WORK REMAINS. THE TOTAL HEAT REJECTED FROM A FOIL SAMPLE, ACCOUNTING FOR EMITTING SURFACE AREA, MUST BE CHARACTERIZED. LIKEWISE, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FOIL AND THE SURFACE IT IS PROTECTING MUST BE DETERMINED. NEXT, AN ACTUATION SYSTEM AND FIXATION COMPONENTS MUST BE DEVELOPED.

RNA, A UNIQUELY INFORMATION-DENSE AND CATALYTIC BIOMOLECULE, SITS AT THE CENTER OF THIS REQUIREMENT FOR LIFE IN ALL KNOWN BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRANSITION FROM SIMPLE CHEMICAL TO COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. AMONG RNA COMPONENTS DEFINING THE CENTRAL DOGMA, THERE IS PERHAPS NONE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE RIBOSOME, WHICH SERVES AS A CELLULAR NEXUS OF INFORMATION TRANSFER, RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND GROWTH MODULATION. CONSERVATION OF THE RIBOSOME IS USED TO TRACE EVOLUTIONARY TRAJECTORIES ACROSS THE TREE OF LIFE FROM LUCA, YET THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT RRNA-BASED PHYLOGENETIC RECONSTRUCTIONS OF INTERMEDIATE VERSIONS OF THE TRANSLATIONAL APPARATUS. METHODOLOGIES THAT ENABLE THE RECONSTRUCTION AND EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION OF ANCESTRAL RIBOSOME INTERMEDIATES ALONG PLAUSIBLE EVOLUTIONARY TRAJECTORIES TO ITS CURRENT FORM WOULD TRANSFORM OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ORIGIN OF LIFE ON EARTH, ELUCIDATE THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN RIBOSOMES, AND POTENTIALLY INFORM ROUTES FOR TRANSLATION ELSEWHERE IN THE COSMOS. MAJOR GOALS: HISTORICALLY, ORIGINS-OF-LIFE RESEARCHERS HAVE FOCUSED ON A􀁅BOTTOM-UP􀁅 APPROACH TO THE PREDICTION OF INTERMEDIATE PRE-BIOTIC BIOMOLECULES, IN WHICH ARTIFICIAL CHEMICAL SYSTEMS ARE CONSTRUCTED IN ATTEMPTS TO RECREATE CONDITIONS ON THE EARLY EARTH. CONVERSELY, A􀁅TOP-DOWN􀁅 APPROACH, IN WHICH EXISTING BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS ARE REDUCED TO THEIR UNDERLYING COMPONENTS, WOULD INFORM THE FUNCTIONAL AND MINIMAL COMPONENTS THAT MAY HAVE EXISTED IN A PREBIOTIC ERA. WE PROPOSE TO TAKE A TOP-DOWN APPROACH TO THE MINIMIZATION OF THE RIBOSOME WITHIN THE FUNCTIONALITY-RELEVANT ENVIRONMENT OF THE CELL. SUCH A COMBINATION OF THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS WOULD INFORM THE CHEMICAL FUNCTIONALITY DEFINING TRANSLATION. HOWEVER, STUDIES AIMED AT PROBING CELLULAR TRANSLATION HAVE RARELY ACCESSED SUCH A DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF THE MINIMAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSLATION. THIS IS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH RIBOSOME MANIPULATION IN VIVO, AS TRANSLATION CANNOT BE EASILY UNCOUPLED FROM CELLULAR VIABILITY OR OVERALL FITNESS. THUS, OUR PROPOSED WORK REQUIRES THE REMOVAL OF CONFOUNDING ATTRIBUTES REGULATING CELLULAR VIABILITY THAT MAY BE INCORRECTLY ASSUMED TO INFLUENCE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS BIOMOLECULAR ACTIVITY. SPECIFIC AIMS: TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, WE PROPOSE TO INTEGRATE SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY, COMPUTATIONAL AND PHYLOGENETIC RRNA ANALYSIS, AND EVOLUTIONARY PRINCIPLES TO INFORM PLAUSIBLE AND TESTABLE MINIMAL RIBOSOME INTERMEDIATES EN ROUTE TO THE EXTANT TRANSLATION MACHINERY OF THE CELL: 1. AIM I: CONSTRUCTION OF A DEFINED SENSOR THAT RECAPITULATES RIBOSOMAL ACTIVITY IN E. COLI AS A MODULAR AND ORTHOGONAL PLATFORM BY UNCOUPLING TRANSLATION FROM HOST VIABILITY. 2. AIM II: APPLICATION OF THIS SENSOR PLATFORM TOWARDS THE IN VIVO ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF RRNA TRUNCATIONS AND/OR MUTATIONS ON TRANSLATION OF A SINGULAR SYNTHETIC MRNA TRANSCRIPT. 3. AIM III: OPTIMIZATION OF MINIMIZED RRNA VARIANTS USING PHAGE-ASSISTED CONTINUOUS EVOLUTION (PACE) TO REVEAL COMPENSATORY MUTATIONS THAT ENHANCE ACTIVITY. CONCLUSION: OUR PROPOSED WORK AIMS TO OVERCOME CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH RIBOSOMAL MANIPULATION IN VIVO AND PROVIDES AN INNOVATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR THE DERIVATION OF MINIMIZED RIBOSOMES. WHILE THIS IS AN AMBITIOUS INTEGRATION OF EVOLUTIONARY PRINCIPLES AND SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY TO ILLUMINATE THE ORIGINS OF TRANSLATION, WE HOPE THAT IT WILL SUPPLEMENT THE EXISTING (BUT INCOMPLETE) MOLECULAR RECORD OF RIBOSOMAL EVOLUTION AND PROVIDE NOVEL INSIGHT INTO POTENTIAL PROTO-RIBOSOMAL GENOTYPES AND PHENOTYPES.

THE CURRENT RELAB SPECTRAL DATABASE CONTAINS #tilde#24,000 SPECTRAL FILES CORRESPONDING TO #tilde#12,000 UNIQUE SAMPLES, INCLUDING A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF LUNAR AND METEORITE SAMPLES. THE LATTER ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT GIVEN PAST, RECENT AND UPCOMING MISSIONS THAT UTILIZE VIS-NIR-IR WAVELENGTHS (E.G., MARS MGS, ODYSSEY, MARS EXPRESS, MRO, CHANDRAYAAN-1, DAWN, MESSENGER, OSIRIS-REX, HAYABUSA-2 ETC.). ALL DATA COLLECTED AT RELAB HAVE BEEN PUBLICLY AVAILABLE OVER THIS TIME PERIOD AND AVAILABLE TO THE WORLD. HOWEVER, THE NEEDS OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TO EASILY SEARCH AND ACCESS THIS LARGE DATABASE HAVE GROWN TREMENDOUSLY DURING THE DIGITAL AGE AND IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE DATABASE TO EVOLVE IN ORDER TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. HERE WE PROPOSE SEVERAL IMPORTANT STEPS TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE AND IMPROVE THE USABILITY AND SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF THE VAST RELAB SPECTRAL LIBRARY. THE WORK PLAN CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THREE MAJOR TASKS: TASK 1: RESTRUCTURE EXISTING SPECTRAL DATABASE/CATALOG, CORRECT INCONSISTENCIES, AND INCORPORATE INTO A RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO PREPARE FOR INTEGRATION WITH AN ONLINE SEARCH TOOL. WHEN POSSIBLE, MISSING SAMPLE INFORMATION WILL BE ADDED TO THE DATABASE AS WELL AS AUXILIARY SAMPLE INFORMATION (CHEMISTRY, MINERALOGY, PHOTOS, ETC.). TASK 2: FORMAT ALL EXISTING SPECTRAL FILES TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH PDS4 STANDARDS AND, AFTER PEER REVIEW, DELIVER ALL EXISTING SPECTRAL DATA TO THE PDS GEOSCIENCES NODE (AT WASHINGTON UNIV. IN ST.

THE EXPECTED PRODUCTS WILL BE QUANTITATIVE MINERAL MAPS OF THE SURFACE OF VESTA AND AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MINERALOGICAL CHANGES ON THE SURFACE RELATE TO HED METEORITE COMPOSITIONS. INITIAL STUDIES OF DAWN VISIBLE INFRARED SPECTROMETER (VIR) DATA HAVE FOCUSED ON QUALITATIVE COMPARISONS OF SPECTRAL FEATURES TO THOSE OBSERVED IN LAB DATA OF HOWARDITE, EUCRITE, AND DIOGENITE (HED) METEORITES, RESULTING IN ESTIMATES OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE METEORITE COMPONENTS ON VESTA S SURFACE. HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANTLY MORE INFORMATION CAN BE GAINED IF QUANTITATIVE MINERAL ABUNDANCES CAN BE DERIVED FROM SUCH DATA, ESPECIALLY AT A GLOBAL SCALE. MODAL MINERALOGY AND KNOWLEDGE OF VARIATIONS IN PYROXENE CHEMISTRY, FOR INSTANCE, CAN BE USEFUL FOR ASSESSING VARIATIONS IN EUCRITE AND DIOGENITE COMPONENT ABUNDANCES WITHIN REGIONS WHOSE SPECTRA ARE  HOWARDITE-LIKE . IN ADDITION, DETAILED MIXING MODELS THAT YIELD ACCURATE MODAL MINERALOGY CAN HELP TO IDENTIFY AREAS THAT MAY INDICATE LOWER CRUSTAL OR MANTLE COMPOSITIONS, REVEALING NEW INFORMATION ABOUT LITHOLOGIC VARIATIONS WITH DEPTH. THE MAJOR GOAL OF THIS WORK WILL BE TO PRODUCE GLOBAL MAPS OF MINERAL ABUNDANCES DERIVED FROM HAPKE AND SHKURATOV MODELS AS APPLIED TO VIR DATA AND TO DISCUSS THE IMPLICATIONS OF OBSERVED VARIATIONS IN MINERALOGY IN THE CONTEXT OF HED COMPOSITIONS AND PETROLOGIC EVOLUTION MODELS FOR VESTA. METHODS: THESE GOALS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY APPLYING RADIATIVE TRANSFER MODELS (RTMS) TO DAWN VIR DATA. A PILOT STUDY HAS BEEN CONDUCTED TO VALIDATE OUR METHODS AND DEMONSTRATE OUR ABILITY TO WORK WITH VIR DATA. TO FURTHER TEST THE VALIDITY OF HAPKE AND SHKURATOV RTMS FOR HED AND DAWN SPECTRA, WE WILL FIRST CARRY OUT ADDITIONAL LAB MEASUREMENTS OF HOWARDITE SAMPLES TO EXPAND UPON OUR EXISTING TEST DATASET THAT RELIED UPON DIOGENITE AND EUCRITE SAMPLES. THOUGH A MINOR COMPONENT, THIS INITIAL LAB WORK WILL PROVIDE A MUCH-NEEDED FOUNDATION FOR QUANTIFYING THE UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH APPLYING RTMS TO VIR SPECTRA, AN IMPORTANT STEP GIVEN THAT BRECCIAS LIKELY DOMINATE VESTA S SURFACE. SAMPLES WILL BE CHARACTERIZED BY VIS-NIR REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY AND MODAL MINERALOGY WILL BE ESTIMATED FROM XRD DATA USING RIETVELD REFINEMENT. THE BULK OF THE WORK WILL INVOLVE ANALYSIS OF DAWN DATA AND APPLICATION OF THE HAPKE AND SHKURATOV RTMS TO VIR SPECTRA USING INVERSE THEORY. ISIS SOFTWARE WILL BE USED TO PROCESS THE VIR DATA, MAP PROJECT IMAGES, AND MOSAIC INDIVIDUAL IMAGE CUBES. MATLAB SCRIPTS WILL BE USED TO APPLY OUR RTM CODES TO THE VIR DATA, RESULTING IN MODAL MINERALOGY MAPS (E.G., MAPS OF OLIVINE, PYROXENE, PLAGIOCLASE ABUNDANCE, ETC.). THE RESULTING MAPS AND SPECTRA WILL THEN BE COMPARED TO HED SPECTRA AND COMPOSITIONS TO ASSESS DIFFERENT PETROLOGIC MODELS. DAWN FRAMING CAMERA DATA WILL BE EXAMINED FOR AREAS OF SPECIAL INTEREST (E.G., HIGH OLIVINE AND/OR HIGH PYROXENE CONCENTRATIONS) TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE LOCAL GEOLOGIC CONTEXT OF THESE REGIONS. RELEVANCE: THIS WORK IS RELEVANT TO THE DDAP CALL IN THAT IT WILL ENHANCE THE SCIENTIFIC RETURN OF THE DAWN AT VESTA MISSION THROUGH THE PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS OF EXISTING DAWN VIR DATA TO PRODUCE QUANTITATIVE MINERAL MAPS OF VESTA S SURFACE. THESE MINERAL MAPS WILL BE COMPARED AGAINST SPECTRAL AND MINERALOGICAL COMPOSITIONS OF HED METEORITES TO TEST VARIOUS MODELS ABOUT THE PETROLOGIC EVOLUTION OF VESTA, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE ABUNDANCE OF EUCRITE AND DIOGENITE COMPONENTS IN REGIONS THAT ARE SPECTRALLY AKIN TO HOWARDITES.

WE PROPOSE TO MODEL THE OBSERVED GRAVITATIONAL AND TOPOGRAPHIC SIGNATURES OF LUNAR BASIN RINGS TO INVESTIGATE THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATION OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE LUNAR LITHOSPHERE.  IN TASK 1, WE WILL USE GRAIL GRAVITY DATA AND LOLA TOPOGRAPHY DATA IN ORDER TO CONSTRAIN THE SUBSURFACE STRUCTURE OF PEAK RING AND MULTI-RING BASINS. MODELS OF THE CRUSTAL STRUCTURE OF THE BASINS WILL BE USED TO QUANTIFY THE DIP AND DISPLACEMENT ACROSS INDIVIDUAL FAULTS. COMPARISONS BETWEEN BASINS AND ASYMMETRIES WITHIN INDIVIDUAL BASINS WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE SENSITIVITY OF THE RING FAULT CHARACTERISTICS TO TARGET PROPERTIES SUCH AS CRUSTAL THICKNESS AND HEAT FLOW.  IN TASK 2, WE WILL STUDY THE STRUCTURE OF THE RINGS THAT CHARACTERIZE MULTI-RING BASINS BY FORWARD MODELING THEIR GRAVITATIONAL SIGNATURES. THIS TASK WILL INCLUDE MODELING THE FORMATION OF MULTI-RING BASINS TO DETERMINE HOW THE GRAVITY SIGNATURES, LOCATIONS, SPACING, AND OFFSETS OF BASIN RINGS DEPEND ON THE THICKNESS OF THE LUNAR LITHOSPHERE, IMPACTOR SIZE, AND PRE-IMPACT CRUSTAL THICKNESS.

ADDITIONAL ANALYSES WILL FOCUS ON THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT TARGET PROPERTIES BY COMPARING BASINS THAT DIFFER PRIMARILY IN A SINGLE KEY PARAMETER. THE EFFECT OF HEAT FLOW WILL BE INVESTIGATED LOOKING AT TWO SIMILARLY SIZED BASINS WITHIN AND OUTSIDE OF THE PKT (E.G., IMBRIUM AND ORIENTALE), OR TWO SIMILARLY SIZED BASINS FORMED IN THE PRE-NECTARIAN AND NECTARIAN/IMBRIAN (E.G., SMITHII AND ORIENTALE). THE EFFECT OF CRUSTAL THICKNESS WILL BE INVESTIGATED BY COMPARING TWO SIMILARLY SIZED BASINS IN THE THICK CRUST OF THE FARSIDE HIGHLAND AND THE THIN CRUST OF THE SOUTH POLE-AITKEN BASIN (E.G., HERTZSPRUNG AND APOLLO).

HOWEVER, CLIMATE MODELS HAVE BEEN INCAPABLE OF REPRODUCING THESE CONDITIONS AS THEY HAVE NOT FOUND A PLAUSIBLE COMBINATION OF GREENHOUSE GASES TO BRING MATS CONSISTENTLY ABOVE THE MELTING POINT OF WATER.

IN THE LATTER CLIMATE SCENARIO, THE ATMOSPHERE AND SURFACE THERMALLY COUPLE, INDUCING AN ALTITUDE-DEPENDENT TEMPERATURE EFFECT AND CAUSING SNOW TO DEPOSIT IN THE HIGHLANDS. INTERESTINGLY, THE VALLEY NETWORKS AND LAKES ARE OBSERVED AT DISTAL PORTIONS OF THE ICE SHEET IN  COLD AND ICY  CONDITIONS, WHERE RUNOFF AND PONDING IS EXPECTED FOLLOWING MELTING OF THE ICE SHEET. THREE END-MEMBER MECHANISMS FOR PRODUCING TRANSIENT HEATING IN A  COLD AND ICY  CLIMATE, PERMITTING TRANSIENT MELTING OF THE ICE SHEET AND SUBSEQUENT RUNOFF, INCLUDE IMPACT CRATERING, VOLCANISM, AND GREENHOUSE WARMING (E.G.

HOWEVER, THE VISCOSITIES OF ILMENITE-BEARING MAFIC AND ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS RELEVANT TO THE LUNAR MANTLE HAVE NOT BEEN MEASURED IN THE LABORATORY. RECENT EXPERIMENTAL WORK SHOWS THAT ILMENITE (FETIO3) IS NEARLY FOUR ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE WEAKER THAN DRY OLIVINE AT MANTLE CONDITIONS. RHEOLOGICAL MIXING MODELS PREDICT THAT A LUNAR MANTLE WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF ILMENITE COULD BE DRAMATICALLY WEAKER THAN AN ILMENITE-FREE MANTLE.

THE TRADITIONAL POPULAR RESPONSE TO THESE QUESTIONS IS TO TURN TO THE MINIMAL MODELS OF A SINGLE COLD, COLLISIONLESS PARTICLE WITH A THERMAL HISTORY.

MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE PI WILL INVESTIGATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF DARK MATTER SELF-INTERACTIONS IN TWO NON-MINIMAL DARK MATTER SCENARIOS: A) ULTRALIGHT SCALAR DARK MATTER (AXION-LIKE PARTICLES) AND B) PARTIALLY INTERACTING (DISSIPATIVE) DARK MATTER, EACH REPRESENTING A DISTINCTIVE TYPE OF DARK MATTER DYNAMICS. THE PI WILL ALSO EXPLORE NONLINEAR PROCESSES IN A NON-THERMAL COSMOLOGICAL HISTORY WITH AN EARLY MATTER DOMINATION ERA, ALTERNATIVE TO THE STANDARD THERMAL ONE, AND ITS IMPLICATION FOR DARK MATTER AND DARK SECTORS. NOVEL ASTROPHYSICAL PROBES OF THE NON-MINIMAL DARK MATTER SCENARIOS, SUCH AS GRAVITATIONAL WAVES AND STELLAR KINEMATICS, WILL BE THOROUGHLY EXAMINED. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ADDRESSES NASA''S ASTROPHYSICS OBJECTIVE TO DISCOVER HOW THE UNIVERSE WORKS, EXPLORE HOW IT BEGAN AND EVOLVED. IT WILL EXPLORE NEW AREAS IN THE DARK MATTER LANDSCAPE, ENRICHING AND ADVANCING THE KNOWLEDGE OF DARK MATTER PHYSICS, AS WELL AS FURTHERING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF UNDERLYING PARTICLE PHYSICS RELATED TO DARK MATTER. IT WILL UTILIZE RAPIDLY GROWING ASTROPHYSICAL DATA INCLUDING THOSE COLLECTED BY NASA SPONSORED MISSIONS SUCH AS FERMI, PLANCK AND THE FUTURE LISA, OFFER NEW ANGLES TO INSPECT AND INTERPRET DATA, AND MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF THEORETICAL INFORMATION THAT CAN BE EXTRACTED FROM THE OBSERVATIONAL DATA.""",,,,

VOLATILE PARTITIONING HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED IN TERRESTRIAL SILICATES UNDER OXIDIZING CONDITIONS, HOWEVER THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST STUDY AT THESE HIGHLY REDUCING CONDITIONS (IW-3 TO IW-7). THERE IS A GROWING RECOGNITION THAT SUCH LOW FO2 CONDITION WERE WIDESPREAD AND IMPORTANT IN THE FORMATION OF PLANETARY BODIES, INCLUDING ENSTATITE CHONDRITES, AUBRITES, MERCURY, AND POSSIBLY EVEN EARLY EARTH. REDUCING CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO AFFECT ALL ASPECTS OF THE CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MINERALS AND MELTS AS OXYGEN IS THE DOMINANT NEGATIVELY CHARGED ELEMENT AND IS INVOLVED IN NEARLY ALL REACTIONS. CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTS WILL DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF FO2 AND PRESSURE ON VOLATILE CONTENT OF SILICATES. A SUITE OF REDUCED METEORITES INCLUDING EH, EL, AND AUBRITES WILL BE ANALYZED TO TEST THE PRODUCED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OXYGEN FUGACITY AND SILICATE VOLATILE CONTENT.

THE ALTERATION PATHWAY OF OLIVINE TO MAGNESITE CAN TAKE SEVERAL FORMS WITH DIFFERENT INTERMEDIATE AND FINAL PRODUCT ASSEMBLAGES DEPENDING ON THE DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OF FORMATION.

THE PROPOSED EFFORT HERE WILL RIGOROUSLY EXAMINE HYPOTHESES FOR MINERAL ASSEMBLAGES AND GEOLOGIC EVOLUTION WITH ADVANCED DATA ANALYSIS. WE WILL COMPARE AND CONTRAST 4 ADVANCED MINERAL CHARACTERIZATION ALGORITHMS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SCIENCE OF THE 3 REMAINING MARS 2020 LANDING SITES. THE ALGORITHMS THAT WILL BE COMPARED ARE (1) RADIATIVE TRANSFER UNMIXING FROM OPTICAL CONSTANTS, (2) SPARSE UNMIXING WITH LARGE LIBRARIES OF ENDMEMBERS, (3) TARGET TRANSFORMATION FOR MINERAL PRESENCE/ABSENCE DETERMINATIONS IN CLUTTERED SCENES AND FOR MINERALS WITH SUBTLE FEATURES AND (4) MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES. THE PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON THE BEST MINERAL EXPOSURES IN THESE FIVE SITES. THE SITES THAT HAVE ROVER COVERAGE (OPPORTUNITY, COLUMBIA HILLS AND CURIOSITY) HAVE A MEASURE OF GROUND TRUTH TO COMPARE WITH. THE MULTIPLE WORKING HYPOTHESES FOR THE GEOLOGIC EVOLUTION WILL BE EVALUATED AGAINST THESE MORE ROBUST ANALYSES OF THE MINERAL. THE PROPOSED WORK IS BROKEN INTO FOUR TASKS. (1) EVALUATION AND COMPARISON OF THE FOUR TECHNIQUES USING TWO SOURCES OF LABORATORY MIXTURE DATA: 1) 8 SUITES OF MIXTURES THAT HAVE EXISTING LABORATORY REFLECTANCE SPECTRA AND 2) LABORATORY HYPERSPECTRAL DATA OF AQUEOUS MINERALS MIXED WITH A NEW MARS SOIL SIMULANT. THE EVALUATION WILL INCLUDE THE ACCURACY OF THE APPROACHES IN DETERMINING THE CORRECT MINERAL ASSEMBLAGES AND WHERE APPROPRIATE ABUNDANCES. (2) ANALYSIS OF HIGH QUALITY CRISM OBSERVATIONS OF THE 4 MARS 2020 LANDING SITES WITH THE FOUR TECHNIQUES. THIS WILL REQUIRE CAREFUL TAILORING OF THE TECHNIQUES TO THE UNIQUE QUALITIES OF CRISM DATA COMPARED TO LABORATORY DATA. (3) CRITICAL EVALUATION OF THE QUALITY OF THE APPROACHES INDEPENDENTLY USING STATISTICAL MEASURES OF GOODNESS OF FIT AND INTER COMPARISON OF THE RESULTS.

BESIDES USING LIDARS FOR ALTIMETRY, THESE DEVICES HAVE BEEN USED TO STUDY ATMOSPHERES AND ICE. THE LIDAR IN-SPACE TECHNOLOGY EXPERIMENT (LITE) IN THE 1990 S DEMONSTRATED A NUMBER OF CAPABILITIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS ON BOARD THE SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY. ONE NEW POTENTIAL APPLICATION IS THE USE OF LIDARS FOR PLANETARY SEISMOLOGY. TYPICALLY, SEISMOLOGISTS EXPLOIT MEASUREMENTS OF PRIMARY (P), SECONDARY (S), AND RAYLEIGH WAVES TO INFER STRUCTURE OF THE UNDERLYING PLANETARY BODY. THE P-WAVES ARE LONGITUDINAL WAVES WHICH TRAVEL AT THE COMPRESSIONAL WAVE SPEED IN THE BODY. THE S-WAVES OR SHEAR WAVES ARE TRANSVERSE WAVES WHICH TRAVEL AT THE SHEAR WAVE SPEED. RAYLEIGH WAVES ARE VERTICALLY- POLARIZED PROPAGATING WAVES THAT ARE TRAPPED AT THE INTERFACE BETWEEN AN ELASTIC MEDIUM AND A VACUUM (OR LOW DENSITY ATMOSPHERE SUCH AS EARTH). THESE WAVES CAN PROPAGATE LARGE DISTANCE BECAUSE THEIR AMPLITUDES DECAY PRIMARILY AS ONE OVER SQUARE ROOT OF RANGE, AS OPPOSED TO COMPRESSIONAL (P) AND SHEAR (S) WAVES, WHICH DECAY AS ONE OF RANGE. RAYLEIGH WAVES ARE THE CAUSE OF MUCH DAMAGE DUE SEISMIC ACTIVITY ON EARTH BUT ALSO CAN BE EXCITED BY IMPACTORS ON THE MOONS AND ROCKY PLANETS. SUCH WAVES CAN PROPAGATE IN ICE SHEETS ON EUROPA. INTERFACE WAVES AT THE SEABED ARE CALLED SCHOLTE WAVES AND THOSE WAVES AT THE INTERFACE OF TWO ELASTIC MEDIA ARE CALLED STONELY WAVES. THE DISPERSION OF THE SPEED OF RAYLEIGH WAVES (OFTEN REFERRED TO AS P-SV WAVES) AS A FUNCTION OF FREQUENCY IS DEPENDENT ON THE UNDERLYING VERTICAL PROFILE OF ELASTIC MEDIUM PROPERTIES SUCH AS THE SHEAR MODULUS/SPEED. A NUMBER OF TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE ESTIMATION OF THE VERTICAL SHEAR SPEED GIVEN MEASUREMENTS OF RAYLEIGH WAVE DISPERSION FROM EXPLOSIONS, IMPACTS AND OTHER ENERGETIC SOURCES. MEASUREMENTS OF RAYLEIGH WAVES HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN TAKEN USING GEOPHONES AT LOW FREQUENCIES AND ACCELEROMETERS AT MID- TO HIGH FREQUENCIES. RECENTLY, WE HAVE DEVELOPED CHIRP LASERS TO MEASURE BOTH RANGE AND SURFACE MOTION THROUGH A NASA-EPSCOR RESEARCH SEED GRANT. HERE, WE PROPOSE TO BUILD A LOW SWAP-C (SIZE, WEIGHT, POWER AND COST) WITH TWO OPERATIONAL MODES (RANGING MODE AND DOPPLER MODE) FOR REMOTE SURFACE MEASUREMENT. UNDER RANGING MODE, THE LIDAR SENDS OFF CHIRPED LASER PULSE FOR FREQUENCY MODULATED CONTINUOUS WAVE (FMCW) BASED RANGING OPERATION. UNDER DOPPLER MODE, THE LASER OUTPUTS A HIGH-QUALITY NARROW-LINEWIDTH SINGLE WAVELENGTH LASER, AND RECEIVES THE BEAT SIGNAL BETWEEN THE INCIDENT WAVE AND REFLECTION WAVE TO MEASURE THE SURFACE VELOCITY. THE DUALMODE LIDAR WILL BE BUILT AROUND A DIGITAL CIRCUIT, THE MODE CAN BE CONTROLLED DIGITALLY AND REMOTELY, AND THE SWITCH TIME IS WELL WITHIN 1 MS. IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE STUDY, THE SCIENCE PI (T. WEI, URI) AND TEAM (G. POTTY AND J. H. MILLER, ALSO URI) PROPOSE TO (A) INVESTIGATE THE ENGINEERING AND SIGNAL PROCESSING; AND (B) DEVELOP A MODEL TO PRODUCE SYNTHETIC GROUND MOTION DATA AND RESULTING MODELED LASER PULSE RETURNS.

BIT-3 HAS A UNIQUE ADVANTAGE OF BEING IODINE-COMPATIBLE DUE TO ITS PLASMAGENERATION MECHANISM AND CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL. THE ABILITY TO USE IODINE AS PROPELLANT IS A TRUE GAMECHANGERFOR CUBESAT PROPULSION, BECAUSE IODINE CAN BE STORED AS A DENSE SOLID (AT 4.9G/CC) AND ITS SUB-TORR STORAGE PRESSURE ENABLES VERY LIGHTWEIGHT, EVEN PLASTIC TANKS. WITH A MERE 300CC IODINE TANKONBOARD, THE BIT-3 THRUSTER IS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING>2.8KM/S DELTA-V TO A 6U/12KG CUBESAT.THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THE LUNARCUBE PROGRAM IS TO UNDERTAKE A MISSION TO THE MOON FROM GEO OR ATRANSLUNAR TRAJECTORY (SUCH AS THE EM-1 DROP-OFF) THAT WOULD DEMONSTRATE THE PROPULSION SYSTEM, ANDCARRY OUT A LUNAR SCIENCE PROGRAM AS A CAPABILITY DEMONSTRATION OF THE PLATFORM.

THE RELATION BETWEEN MBH AND STELLAR-VELOCITY DISPERSION (SIGMA) IS CONSIDERED THE TIGHTEST AND THUS THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL. IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE CALIBRATION OF MBH IN AGNS. HOWEVER, WHEN SIGMA IS DETERMINED FROM FIBER-BASED OR LONG-SLIT SPECTROSCOPY, SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY IS INTRODUCED, WITH DEVIATIONS UP TO 40%, DEPENDING ON THE APERTURE USED, DRIVEN BY EFFECTS OF INCLINATION, THE PRESENCE OF A KINEMATICALLY COLD BUT ROTATING DISK AND AN AGN POWER-LAW CONTINUUM OUTSHINING THE UNDERLYING STELLAR ABSORPTION LINES. 3D SPECTROSCOPY IS THE ONLY WAY FORWARD FOR A PRECISE MEASUREMENT OF SIGMA. AT THE SAME TIME, REVERBERATION MAPPING (RM) PROVIDES THE MOST RELIABLE MBH FOR BROAD-LINE AGNS. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RM AGN SAMPLE CANNOT BE OVERSTATED: IT SERVES AS A MBH CALIBRATOR FOR THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE. TO COMPLEMENT 20 NEW, MASSIVE RM AGNS FOR WHICH WE HAVE RECENTLY OBTAINED VLT/ MUSE AND/OR KECK/KCWI 3D SPECTRA, WE HERE PROPOSE TO ANALYSE 13 RM AGNS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE KECK OBSERVATORY ARCHIVE (KOA), HST, AND 2MASS. KOA, HST AND 2MASS ARE PROJECTS/MISSIONS WITH A SIGNIFICANT NASA CONTRIBUTION AND CAN THUS SERVE AS A PRIMARY DATA SOURCE FOR AN ADAP PROPOSAL. SPATIALLY-RESOLVED SIGMA WILL BE DERIVED BY ANALYZING CO ABSORPTION LINES IN NEARINFRARED ADAPTIVE-OPTICS ASSISTED 3D KECK/OSIRIS SPECTRA. THESE SPECTRA ENABLE MEASUREMENTS OF THE STELLAR KINEMATICS DOWN TO THE CENTRAL 100-200 PC. GIVEN THE LOWER LUMINOSITY OF THIS SAMPLE AND THUS THE SMALL BULGE SIZES, SUCH A RESOLUTION IS ESSENTIAL. WE WILL USE A DEBLENDING TECHNIQUE TO SUBTRACT THE UNRESOLVED AGN EMISSION FROM THE NUCLEAR SPECTRA. FOR A PRECISE MEASUREMENT OF HOST GALAXY PROPERTIES, WE WILL ANALYZE ARCHIVAL HST IMAGES. IN PREVIOUS LITERATURE STUDIES, THE EMPHASIS WAS ON THE HOST-GALAXY FREE AGN LUMINOSITY, THAT IS DISENTANGLING HOST AND AGN, FOR THE CREATION OF THE RELATION BETWEEN BROAD-LINE REGION RADIUS AND AGN LUMINOSITY. HERE, WE WILL RE-ANALYZE THE SAMPLE FOCUSING ON OBTAINING A ROBUST MEASUREMENT OF THE EFFECTIVE BULGE RADIUS. MOREOVER, THIS WILL ENSURE A HOMOGENEOUS IMAGE ANALYSIS. WE WILL USE OUR NEW CODE LENSTRONOMY WHICH SUPERSEDES GALFIT BY USING AN MCMC TECHNIQUE TO PROVIDE REALISTIC ERRORS AND EXPLORE THE COVARIANCE BETWEEN THE VARIOUS MODEL PARAMETERS. WE WILL APPLY THE SAME HOST-GALAXY DECOMPOSITION TO K-BAND 2MASS IMAGES WHICH ARE LESS AFFECTED BY EXTINCTION AND COVER THE SAME WAVELENGTH RANGE AS THE OSIRIS SPECTRA. HST AND 2MASS IMAGES ARE THUS COMPLEMENTARY AND INFORM EACH OTHER. FITTING THE CORRECT MODEL IS NOT ONLY IMPORTANT FOR PROPER MORPHOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION, BUT ESPECIALLY FOR THE EFFECTIVE RADIUS MEASUREMENT WHICH IN TURN AFFECTS SIGMA.

THE SPACECRAFT WOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH A HIGH-POWER LASER AND AN INFRARED SPECTROMETER, BOTH POWERED BY PHOTOVOLTAICS. THE LASER IS DIRECTED AT A SPOT ON THE TARGET, WITH CENTRAL FLUX IN THE 10 MW/M2 RANGE. FOR ROCKY TARGETS, MELTING AND EVAPORATION OF SURFACE AND SHALLOW SUB-SURFACE MATERIAL OCCURS. DUE TO PHASE CHANGES, THE SPOT TEMPERATURE RAPIDLY EQUILIBRATES AT #tilde#2500 K, BUT THE FLUX IS INSUFFICIENT TO DISSOCIATE MOST MOLECULAR SPECIES PRESENT. BLACKBODY RADIATION PRODUCED BY THE HEATED SPOT PEAKS NEAR 1 UM, AND TRAVELS OUTWARD THROUGH THE EVAPORATED PLUME. FORTUITOUSLY, THE EQUILIBRATION TEMPERATURE OF THE HEATED SPOT EMITS PEAK RADIATION RIGHT IN THE SPECTRAL RANGE WHERE ABSORPTION OCCURS DUE TO MOLECULAR ROTATIONAL AND VIBRATIONAL MODES. THE HEATED SPOT IS VIEWED BY THE SPECTROMETER THROUGH THE PLUME, AND ABSORPTION LINES CAN BE EXPLOITED TO INFER THE MOLECULAR COMPOSITION OF THE TARGET. THE REMOTE SENSING SYSTEM USES AN ARTIFICIAL BACKLIGHTED SOURCE, AND RELIES ON ABSORPTION OF RADIOMETRIC ENERGY TO DETERMINE MOLECULAR COMPOSITION OF THE TARGET, SUGGESTING THE DESIGNATION REMOTE LASER EVAPORATIVE MOLECULAR ABSORPTION (R-LEMA) SPECTROSCOPY SENSOR SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM IS COMPLEMENTARY TO EXISTING METHODS SUCH AS LASER-INDUCED BREAKDOWN SPECTROSCOPY (LIBS). THE LIBS LASER PRODUCES SUFFICIENT FLUX TO VAPORIZE AND IONIZE THE TARGET MATERIAL; THE LIBS OPTICAL SPECTROMETER OBSERVES CHARACTERISTIC EMISSION FROM MATERIALS IN THE PLASMA, ALLOWING DETERMINATION OF THE ATOMIC COMPOSITION OF THE TARGET.OUR PHASE I EFFORTS PRODUCED AN END-TO-END MODEL OF THE SENSOR SYSTEM, AND SIMULATED OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS WERE EXPLORED. THE MODEL INCLUDES LASER PROPAGATION AND ABSORPTION BY A SIMULATED TARGET. ABSORPTION OF LASER ENERGY DRIVES HEATING, MELTING AND EVAPORATION OF THE TARGET MATERIAL. EVAPORATION IN SPACE ENVIRONMENT CONDITIONS IS PREDICTED, LEADING TO ESTIMATES OF PLUME DENSITY IN FRONT OF THE HEATED SPOT. FINALLY, PLUME CHARACTERISTICS ARE USED TO CALCULATE THE EXPECTED ABSORPTION SPECTRUM AT THE SPECTROMETER. ADDITIONALLY, PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS WERE PERFORMED TO TEST SOME ASPECTS OF THE MODEL, INCLUDING PLUME DENSITY AND ABSORPTION. ALL RESULTS OBTAINED DURING PHASE I INDICATE THAT THE PROPOSED SENSOR SYSTEM CONCEPT IS VIABLE. WE ESTIMATE THE SENSOR SYSTEM CONCEPT TO BE TRL-2 AT THE CULMINATION OF PHASE I. THE PHASE II EFFORT WOULD POTENTIALLY PUSH THE SYSTEM CONCEPT FROM TRL-2 TO TRL-4, BY BUILDING A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT LABORATORY MODEL AND RUNNING EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTS TO TEST THE THEORY DEVELOPED IN PHASE I. IN PARTICULAR, PHASE I RESULTS SUGGEST THE HEATED SPOT WILL PRODUCE SUFFICIENT BLACKBODY FLUX TO BE VIEWED FROM A DISTANCE, I.E., FLUX IS NOT THE LIMITING COMPONENT OF THE SYSTEM. PHASE I RESULTS ALSO SUGGEST THAT MUCH OF THE ABSORPTION OCCURS WITHIN ABOUT ONE SPOT RADIUS FROM THE TARGET. THUS, SPECTRAL DETECTION IS LIMITED PRIMARILY BY EJECTA CONCENTRATION, WHICH IS IN TURN CONTROLLED BY THE SPOT AREA WHERE SUFFICIENT FLUX IS DELIVERED TO PRODUCE EVAPORATION. ANY OPERATIONAL SYSTEM SHOULD THEREFORE SEEK TO MAXIMIZE EVAPORATIVE SPOT AREA WITH AVAILABLE LASER POWER.FOR THE PHASE II EFFORT, WE PROPOSE TO EXECUTE ADVANCED LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS TO MEASURE PARAMETERS OF INTEREST, AND TO COMPARE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS TO ANALYTICAL PREDICTIONS THAT WERE DEVELOPED IN PHASE I. THE PHASE II EFFORT WOULD POTENTIALLY PUSH THE SYSTEM CONCEPT FROM TRL-2 TO TRL-4. DURING THE PHASE II GRANT PERIOD, WE WOULD ALSO DEVELOP A ROADMAP TO TRL-5, BY SPECIFYING A CUBESAT EXPERIMENT THAT COULD BE EXECUTED IN LOW-EARTH ORBIT, OVER A MODEST DISTANCE IN THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT.",,,,

M. KECK OBSERVATORY (WMKO) IS FOR RENEWAL OF THE COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT AWARD FOR SUPPORT OF NASA MISSIONS AND NASA SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AT WMKO, WHICH OPERATES THE WORLD S TWO (2) LARGEST STEERABLE OPTICAL AND INFRARED TELESCOPES ON THE SUMMIT OF MAUNAKEA ON THE ISLAND OF HAWAII. NASA UTILIZES ONE-SIXTH OF THE ANNUAL OPERATION CAPABILITY OF WMKO, HAVING INVESTED ONE-SIXTH OF THE CAPITAL COSTS AND ONE-SIXTH OF THE OPERATIONS COSTS SINCE CIRCA 1996. THERE HAS BEEN A WEALTH OF SCIENTIFIC RESULTS COMING FROM THE DYNAMIC SCIENTIFIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NASA MISSIONS SUCH AS HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE (HST), SPITZER, KEPLER, K2, CHANDRA, HERSCHEL, WISE, GALEX, VOYAGER, GALILEO, DEEP IMPACT, CASSINI, NEW HORIZONS, AND THE KECK OBSERVATORY. WE PROPOSE HERE TO EXTEND THAT PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP TO FUTURE NASA MISSIONS; JWST, TESS, WFIRST, EUCLID, MARS 2020, AND OTHER MIDEX, SMEX, DISCOVERY, AND NEW FRONTIERS MISSIONS. THE LINK BETWEEN NASA AND WMKO IS POWERFUL. NASA S SPACE BASED DISCOVERIES INFORM AND ARE INFORMED BY THE FINDINGS OF ITS GROUND BASED PARTNER, THE W. M. KECK OBSERVATORY. NASA RELATED PROJECTS ARE PROPOSED BY THE US COMMUNITY TO NEXSCI AND ARE AWARDED OBSERVING TIME PROVIDED BY NASA. THIS HAS PROVEN PRODUCTIVE IN THE PAST. A PRIME EXAMPLE IS WHEN KEPLER DISCOVERED OBJECTS TRANSITING STARS, WMKO UNDERTOOK KEY OBSERVATIONS THAT ESTABLISHED THAT THE CANDIDATE EXOSOLAR PLANETS WERE INDEED VALID EXOSOLAR PLANETS, AND MEASURED THEIR MASSES, LEADING TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ONE OF NASA S LEVEL 1 SCIENCE GOALS: MAKING A CENSUS OF PLANETARY SYSTEMS DOWN TO THE LEVEL OF EARTH-SIZED PLANETS. WHEN SPITZER AND HST BOTH DETECTED AN OBJECT IN THE DISTANT UNIVERSE, WMKO DELIVERED THE EXACT REDSHIFT OF 8.68, WELL WITHIN THE REGION THAT WAS THOUGHT TO BE THE DARK AGE BEFORE REIONIZATION. THE RESEARCH PROGRAM ENABLED BY THE NASA/WMKO PARTNERSHIP MAPS DIRECTLY TO THE ASTROPHYSICAL AND PLANETARY PRIORITIES OF NASA: THE ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF THE UNIVERSE, THE PROCESSES FOR LIFE ON OTHER PLANETS, THE PROCESSES OF FORMATION OF STARS, GALAXIES, AND PLANETS, AND THE CONTENT, ORIGIN, AND EVOLUTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND THE POTENTIAL FOR LIFE ELSEWHERE. THE SCOPE OF THE ASTROPHYSICS AND PLANETARY SCIENCE IS BREATHTAKING, RANGING FROM THE BIRTH OF THE UNIVERSE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF STARS AND GALAXIES OVER COSMIC TIME, TO THE SEARCH FOR LIFE ON PLANETS AROUND OTHER STARS, TO THE FORMATION, EVOLUTION, AND POSSIBILITY OF LIFE ON OTHER PLANETS IN OUR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM. THE TWO 10-METER PRIMARY APERTURES, DIVERSE INSTRUMENT SUITE INCLUDING ADAPTIVE OPTICS AND THE SUPERB LOCATION ON MAUNAKEA MAKE WMKO AN EXTRAORDINARILY POWERFUL AND UNIQUE FACILITY FOR ADDRESSING THE RESEARCH AREAS DESCRIBED ABOVE. ADDITIONALLY, WMKO CAN REACT QUICKLY TO NASA MISSION NEEDS, REARRANGING NIGHTS ON SHORT NOTICE. THE TRACK RECORD OF DISCOVERIES BY SCIENTISTS USING THE WMKO IN CONJUNCTION WITH NASA MISSIONS OVER THE LAST TWO (2) DECADES GIVES STRONG TESTIMONY TO THAT CASE. THE PROGRAM CORRESPONDING TO NASA S IN-GUIDE FUNDING AMOUNT PROVIDES NASA ONE-SIXTH OF WMKO OPERATIONS SUPPORT AND, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE NASA EXOPLANET SCIENCE INSTITUTE (NEXSCI), WMKO WILL CONTINUE ITS KECK OBSERVATORY ARCHIVE (KOA) ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, WE SUBMIT HERE AN OVER-GUIDE THAT ALLOWS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF DATA REDUCTION PIPELINES (DRPS) OVER A PERIOD OF FIVE (5) YEARS, TO SPEED THE REDUCTION OF NEW DATA WITH IMPROVED TOOLS AND TO ACCESS THE INFORMATION INHERENT IN 25 YEARS OF  THE KECK SKY  EASILY AND EFFICIENTLY FOR ALL USERS.

THESE ARE ABUNDANT ELEMENTS WHICH SERVE AS REFERENCE ELEMENTS FOR OTHER GENESIS ELEMENTAL ANALYSIS AND MUST BE MEASURED TO THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE ACCURACY. FINAL FE AND MG FLUENCES ARE AVAILABLE. (D) NA, K. THESE ARE AMONG THE LOWEST FIP ELEMENTS, THUS CRITICAL IN DETERMINING THE EXTENT OF FIP FRACTIONATION. (E) MG ISOTOPES IN DIAMONDLIKE- C COLLECTORS.

THIS TOOLKIT WILL CONSIST OF INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS BASED ON FREE SURFACE FLOW ALONG COMPLEX-SHAPED SUBSTRATES, INTENDED TO MIMIC THE BEHAVIOR ELECTRICAL RESISTORS, CAPACITORS, DIODES, SWITCHES, TRANSISTORS, INTEGRATORS AND THE LIKE. THESE PRIMARY ELEMENTS WILL BE STRUNG TOGETHER TO FORM SELF-REGULATING CAPILLARY NETWORKS OPTIMIZED TO TRANSPORT THIN PROPELLANT LIQUID FILMS FOR A NOVEL CLASS OF MINIATURE SPACE PROPULSION SYSTEMS. THESE NETWORKS WILL NOT ONLY FACILITATE FLUID STORAGE AND HANDLING WITHIN THE PROPELLANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM BUT ALSO SUPPLY PROPELLANT TO REMOTE REGIONS OF THE DEVICE WHERE OTHER MECHANISMS CAN BE ENFORCED TO INDUCE PROPULSION CAPABILITY, SUCH AS DROPLET EMISSION.

THE ANALYSIS WILL BE EXTENDED TO INCLUDE STOCHASTICITY AS WELL, TO ACCOUNT FOR SURFACE ROUGHNESS SINCE THE PROCESSING AND FABRICATION OF THE UNDERLYING SUBSTRATES TYPICALLY GENERATE SIGNIFICANT SURFACE ROUGHNESS, WHOSE MEAN VALUE IS OFTEN OF THE ORDER OF THE THICKNESS OF THE SPREADING LIQUID FILM. THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED BY A STOCHASTIC MAPPING WHEREBY THE ORIGINAL DETERMINISTIC PROBLEM SUBJECT TO A RANDOM DOMAIN IS MAPPED INTO A STOCHASTIC PROBLEM IN A DETERMINISTIC DOMAIN.

MEANWHILE, NO PLAUSIBLE PHYSICAL EXPLANATION HAS BEEN PROFFERED FOR WHY THESE BLACK HOLE SYSTEMS SHOULD BE SO IRON RICH.

ROVERS HAVE YET TO VISIT AN INVERTED CHANNEL ON MARS AND THEREFORE WE LACK THE NECESSARY IN-SITU SEDIMENTOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS TO PROPERLY RECONSTRUCT PALEOHYDROLOGY FOR VERIFYING THE ORBITAL RECONSTRUCTIONS. IN-SITU INVESTIGATIONS OF INVERTED CHANNELS ON EARTH CAN PARTLY FILL THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP, AND ALLOW US TO BUILD BETTER METHODS FOR QUANTIFYING THE PALEO-HYDROLOGY OF ANCIENT RIVERS ON MARS FROM ORBITAL OBSERVATIONS ALONE. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP, TEST, AND IMPLEMENT A METHOD FOR QUANTITATIVE INTERPRETATION OF ANCIENT MARTIAN RIVER NETWORKS AND THEIR DEPOSITS FROM ORBITAL OBSERVATIONS OF INVERTED CHANNELS ON MARS. WE WILL ACHIEVE OUR PROPOSED GOAL THROUGH COMPLETION OF THREE MAIN TASKS: (1) MEASURE RIDGE DIMENSIONS (BREADTH, THICKNESS, SLOPE, RELIEF) AND SEDIMENTOLOGY (FACIES, CROSS-BEDDING, PALEOHYDROLOGY) AT INVERTED CHANNELS IN UTAH AND SPAIN. (2) USE MEASUREMENTS FROM TASK 1 TO TEST THE TWO COMMON HYPOTHESES FOR INVERTED CHANNEL FORMATION   WHETHER RIDGES ACCURATELY REFLECT THE DIMENSIONS OF THE PALEO-RIVER CHANNEL OR MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT THE GEOMETRY OF AN EXHUMED RIVER-BELT DEPOSIT. THIS WILL ENABLE US TO DEVELOP A SET OF QUANTITATIVE SCALING RELATIONS BETWEEN OBSERVABLE MODERN RIDGE GEOMETRY AND RECONSTRUCTED PALEO-RIVER GEOMETRY. (3) MAP EXTENT OF INVERTED CHANNELS AND APPLY THE NEW SCALING RELATIONS FROM TASK 2 TO RECONSTRUCT PALEOHYDROLOGY FROM MEASUREMENTS OF INVERTED CHANNELS IN THE AEOLIS DORSA REGION OF MARS. THIS REGION IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST BECAUSE IT HAS THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF INVERTED CHANNELS ON THE PLANET, SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN INTERPRETED AS EVIDENCE FOR CLIMATE CHANGE, A GLOBAL OCEAN, AND REGIONAL TECTONICS. EXPECTED RESULTS INCLUDE A QUANTITATIVE METHOD, VALIDATED WITH EARTH ANALOGS, FOR RECONSTRUCTING THE PALEO-HYDROLOGY OF ANCIENT RIVERS ACROSS MARS, AND SPECIFIC INTERPRETATIONS FROM AEOLIS DORSA WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR THE GLOBAL HISTORY OF MARS. THE PROPOSED WORK SUPPORTS NASA S OBJECTIVES FOR IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF HABITABLE ENVIRONMENTS AND CLIMATE ON MARS, THEIR CHANGES, AND THEIR MODIFICATIONS TO THE SURFACE (PLANETARY SCIENCE DECADAL SURVEY PRIMARY QUESTION 5; MEPAG 2015 GOALS IA, IIC, IIIA), AND WILL ALSO SUPPORT INTERPRETATION OF CANDIDATE LANDING SITES FOR THE MARS 2020 ROVER.",,,,

WE HAVE SELECTED SIX BLACK HOLES WHICH WERE EACH OBSERVED SEVERAL HUNDRED TIMES ON A NEAR-DAILY BASIS. DURING OUTBURSTS, THESE SOURCES DISPLAY THE FULL REPERTOIRE OF ACCRETING BLACK HOLE BEHAVIOR, TRANSITIONING BETWEEN STATES AS THEIR LUMINOSITIES RAMP UP TO THE EDDINGTON LIMIT AND THEN DECAY. OVER THE COURSE OF AN OUTBURST, THEY ALTERNATELY PRODUCE STEADY AND BALLISTIC JETS, QUASI PERIODIC OSCILLATIONS (QPOS), AND SPECTRA THAT EXTEND UP TO SEVERAL MEV.

O DEFINE THE ORIGINS AND SOCIETAL IMPACTS OF VARIABILITY IN THE EARTH/SUN SYSTEM.   ALL THE MISSIONS REVIEWED HERE ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO STUDY THIS CONNECTED SYSTEM.   PROGRESS IN THE COLLECTION OF HIGH QUALITY DATA AND IN THE APPLICATION OF THESE DATA TO COMPUTER MODELS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PHYSICS HAS BEEN EXCEPTIONAL.

THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW REACTIONS THAT COULD PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT YIELDS OF H2 THROUGHOUT THE ATMOSPHERE.

RECENT OBSERVATIONS BY SPACE TELESCOPES AND MARS ORBITER REVEALED STRONG SEASONAL DEPENDENCE IN HYDROGEN ESCAPE FROM THE MARS ATMOSPHERE, WHILE NASA S MAVEN FOUND A SEASONAL DEPENDENCE IN THE D/H RATIO OF THE OBSERVED HYDROGEN CORONA. THESE VARIATIONS ARE INDICATORS OF A SEASONALLY-VARYING WATER ESCAPE MECHANISM, WHICH IS CRUCIAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MARS ATMOSPHERE AND CLIMATE. ALTHOUGH ATMOSPHERIC MODELS HAVE SHOWN THAT THIS COULD BE FROM SEASONAL CHANGES IN WATER VAPOR CONTENT AT HIGH ALTITUDES, REASONS FOR THIS CORRELATION ARE STILL UNKNOWN. ONE POSSIBLE EXPLANATION IS THE TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE DEPENDENCE IN THE REACTION RATE AND ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION OF THE MOLECULAR HYDROGEN FORMATION CHANNEL OF THE ODD HYDROGEN CYCLE IN THE MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE, BUT THESE ARE NOT KNOWN. THIS STUDY WILL DIRECTLY ADDRESS NASA S MARS EXPLORATION SCIENTIFIC GOAL OF UNDERSTANDING THE HISTORY OF MARS ATMOSPHERE AND CLIMATE, BY PROVIDING LABORATORY STUDIES OF KEY REACTIONS THAT INFLUENCE THE WATER ESCAPE MECHANISM, ULTIMATELY INCORPORATING THEM INTO THE CALTECH/JPL 1-D PHOTOCHEMICAL MODEL FOR MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE.

A NUMBER OF TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS IN SUPERCONDUCTING SENSORS FOR THESE APPLICATIONS REQUIRE LOW-LOSS DIELECTRIC THIN FILMS. EXAMPLES INCLUDE: MICROSTRIP-COUPLED SUPERCONDUCTING MM/SUBMM DETECTORS, WHICH RELY ON SUPERCONDUCTOR-DIELECTRIC-SUPERCONDUCTOR MICROSTRIP TRANSMISSION LINE TO TRANSMIT OPTICAL POWER FROM A COHERENT RECEPTION ELEMENT (FEED HORN, LENS COUPLED ANTENNA, PHASED-ARRAY ANTENNA) TO DETECTORS; SUPERCONDUCTING SPECTROMETERS (SUPERSPEC, TIME, MICROSPEC), WHICH USE SUCH MICROSTRIP TO ROUTE OPTICAL POWER TO DETECTORS AND TO DEFINE SPECTRAL CHANNELS; KINETIC INDUCTANCE DETECTORS (KIDS), WHICH USE CAPACITORS. IN THE ABOVE, THE DIELECTRIC LOSS, QUANTIFIED BY THE LOSS TANGENT (TAN DELTA), IS CRITICAL: IT DETERMINES THE OPTICAL LOSS IN THE MICROSTRIP, THE RESOLUTION OF SPECTRAL CHANNELS, AND THE TWO-LEVEL-SYSTEM (TLS) DIELECTRIC FLUCTUATION NOISE OF THE KID CAPACITOR. CURRENTLY, THE AMORPHOUS DIELECTRICS SIO2 AND SINX ARE USED BECAUSE THEY ARE MOST CONVENIENT FOR FABRICATION. THEY HAVE TAN DELTA #tilde# 1E-3. THIS LOSS TANGENT IS ACCEPTABLE FOR MICROSTRIPLINE BUT SEVERELY LIMITS THE POSSIBLE ARCHITECTURES AND SPECTRAL RESOLVING POWER, AND IT IS TOO LARGE FOR KID CAPACITORS. LOWER LOSS DIELECTRIC WOULD RESULT IN A QUANTUM LEAP IN CAPABILITY, OPENING UP DESIGN SPACE HERETOFORE INACCESSIBLE AND ENABLING DESIGN INNOVATIONS. SPECIFIC IMPACTS ON THE ABOVE TECHNOLOGIES WOULD BE: FOR PHASED-ARRAY ANTENNAS, LOWER OPTICAL LOSS WOULD ALLOW THE DETECTORS TO BE MOVED AWAY FROM THE ANTENNA, ALLOWING THEM TO BE SHIELDED FROM ABSORPTION OF LIGHT THAT HAS NOT BEEN SPATIALLY OR SPECTRALLY FILTERED AND ALSO OBVIATING LONG WIRING BUSSES. MORE SOPHISTICATED ANTENNA DESIGNS, SUCH AS MULTISCALE ANTENNAS COVERING A DECADE OF SPECTRAL BANDWIDTH, COULD BE ENTERTAINED; FOR SUPERCONDUCTING SPECTROMETERS, LOWER LOSS WOULD IMPROVE THE SPECTRAL RESOLUTION LIMIT, RMAX = (1/TAN DELTA), FROM 1E3 TO 2E5, SUFFICIENT FOR RESOLVED EXTRAGALACTIC MM/SUBMM SPECTROSCOPY, WHERE INTRINSIC LINE WIDTHS ARE DNU/NU #tilde# 1E-4 TO 1E-3; FOR KIDS, THE INTERDIGITATED CAPACITORS (IDC) CURRENTLY USED COULD BE REPLACED BY PARALLEL-PLATE CAPACITORS 40 TIMES SMALLER IN AREA, PRESENTING A NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES OVER IDCS IN PROPERTIES SUCH AS FOCAL PLANE FILL FACTOR AND MOUNTING ARCHITECTURE, DIRECT ABSORPTION, AND INTER-KID COUPLING. THERE EXIST TWO PATHS IN THE LITERATURE TO LOWER LOSS: HYDROGENATED AMORPHOUS SILICON (A-SI:H) AND CRYSTALLINE SILICON (CSI). CRYSTALLINE SILICON INTRINSICALLY HAS TAN DELTA<5E-6, 200 TIMES LOWER THAN SIO2 AND SINX. A-SI:H HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED WITH TAN DELTA<5E-5, NOT AS GOOD AS CSI BUT STILL 20 TIMES BETTER THAN SIO2 AND SINX. WE WILL PURSUE THE DEVELOPMENT OF BOTH OPTIONS DUE THEIR COMPLEMENTARY ADVANTAGES AND CHALLENGES. WHILE A PROCESS HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED FOR 5 UM CSI WITH DELTA<1E-4 AND CONSISTENT WITH OTHER DESIGN/FABRICATION CONSTRAINTS, IT HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN YET THAT THIS CAN BE EXTENDED TO MORE CONVENIENT 1 UM AND 2 UM THICKNESSES.

FELDSPAR IS ABUNDANT IN ORDINARY CHONDRITES AND MARTIAN METEORITES AND RECORDS SHOCK EVENTS THROUGH SEVERAL TRANSITIONS THAT ARE USED TO DEFINE PRESSURE (P) AND TEMPERATURE (T) FOR IMPACTS ON ASTEROIDS AND MARS. SHOCK EXPERIMENTS ON FELDSPAR THAT REPRODUCE THE OBSERVED SHOCK EFFECTS IN METEORITES ARE THE BASIS OF ATTEMPTS TO CALIBRATE THE PRESSURE SCALE. HOWEVER, CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE EXPERIMENTS HAVE LEFT LINGERING QUESTIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES OF INTERPRETATION: 1) LABORATORY SHOCKS HAVE NOT YET RECOVERED MANY HIGH-PRESSURE (HP) PHASES FORMED BY TRANSFORMATION OF NATURALLY SHOCKED FELDSPAR, INCLUDING JADEITE, TISSINTITE, LINGUNITE, AND CAS/HAS. THIS IS LIKELY BECAUSE CLASSIC EXPERIMENTS ON MONOMINERALIC OR HOMOGENEOUS ROCK TARGETS DO NOT SAMPLE THE SAME P-T PATH AS NATURAL SHOCKS INTO POROUS REGOLITH TARGETS. 2) SHOCK EXPERIMENTS ON FELDSPAR AND BASALTS WERE MOSTLY DONE BEFORE 1990, WHEREAS IN-SITU NANO-ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES (FE-SEM, EBSD AND FIB-TEM) HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED SINCE THEN. MANY NEW SHOCK-INDUCED MINERALS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED BY NANO-SCALE STUDY OF METEORITES RECENTLY, SUGGESTING THAT SHOCK RECOVERY EXPERIMENTS ALSO NEED TO BE REVISITED WITH MODERN ANALYTICAL TOOLS. 3) PRESSURE THRESHOLDS FOR EFFECTS SUCH AS PLANAR DEFORMATION FEATURES (PDF) AND MASKELYNIZATION ARE BASED MOSTLY ON EXPERIMENTS WITH MONOMINERALIC TARGETS. DIFFERENCES IN STARTING MATERIAL AND HENCE P-T PATH BETWEEN THE LAB AND NATURAL SHOCKS LIMIT THE ACCURACY OF PRESSURE CALIBRATION AND INDEED OUR PRELIMINARY SHOTS ON POROUS BASALT TARGETS REVEAL MASKELYNIZATION WELL BELOW THE NOMINAL THRESHOLD PRESSURE FOR THIS TRANSITION. ALTHOUGH SHOCK DURATION REMAINS A KEY LIMITATION OF LAB SHOCKS, WE PROPOSE TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS WITH A SEQUENCE OF 12 NOVEL EXPERIMENTS TO ACHIEVE P-T PATHS MORE COMPARABLE TO THOSE OF NATURAL SHOCKS. THE EXPERIMENTS, TO BE EXTENSIVELY CHARACTERIZED AT NANO-SCALE, WILL EXPLORE THE LIBRARY OF HP PHASES AFTER FELDSPAR AND PROVIDE MORE ACCURATE PRESSURE CALIBRATION FOR PROGRESSIVE SHOCK EFFECTS: 1) GRADED DENSITY IMPACTORS PROVIDE FAST BUT COLD COMPRESSION PATHS CLOSE TO THE ISENTROPE, A COMPRESSION METHOD NOT YET APPLIED TO RECOVERY EXPERIMENTS. HAVING A SHOCK PULSE LONGER THAN THE THERMAL PULSE PREVENTS POST-SHOCK ANNEALING AND PROMOTES RECOVERY OF HP PHASES. COMPRESSION WITH MINIMAL IRREVERSIBLE HEATING IS ONE PATH TO ACHIEVING QUENCH BY RECOVERING MATERIAL DIRECTLY TO AMBIENT TEMPERATURE. 2) SAMPLES WITH MACHINED PORES CREATE LOCAL HOT SPOTS BY PORE COLLAPSE DURING SHOCK. THE HOT SPOT MAY BE NECESSARY TO ENHANCE DIFFUSION, ENCOURAGE PARTIAL MELTING, AND CATALYZE HP TRANSFORMATIONS. THE SMALL SIZE OF THE HOT SPOT ENCOURAGES QUENCH BY CONDUCTION INTO SURROUNDING, COLDER MATERIAL. 3) OBLIQUE IMPACTS IN WHICH DIFFERENT PARTICLE VELOCITIES ACROSS MATERIAL INTERFACES INDUCE DYNAMIC SLIDING AND SHEAR. DEVIATORIC STRESS DURING SHOCK CAN CHANGE TRANSFORMATION PRESSURES AND MANY NATURAL HP MINERALS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SHEAR VEINS IN METEORITES. 4) MARTIAN ANALOGUE ROCKS WITH VARIABLE POROSITY DIFFER FROM FULLY DENSE SAMPLES AND HOMOGENEOUS ROCK POWDERS. PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS ON BASALT YIELD MASKELYNITE AT LOWER P THAN IN SINGLE CRYSTAL OR POWDER EXPERIMENTS. THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENTS WILL CONFIRM THE SHOCK ORIGIN OF OBSERVED HP MINERALS FROM FELDSPAR IN METEORITES AND PROVIDE MORE ACCURATE PRESSURE CALIBRATION. THE EXPERIMENTS ARE LIKELY ALSO TO REVEAL SHOCK EFFECTS IN OTHER ROCK-FORMING MINERALS AND TERRESTRIAL IMPACT STRUCTURES.

MY HYPOTHESIS IS THAT TESSELLATIONS (I.E., TILINGS) OF DIFFERENT, MULTISTABLE UNIT CELLS ARE THE KEY TO OBTAINING THIS BEHAVIOR. BY APPLYING APPROPRIATE LOCAL KINEMATIC CONSTRAINTS (FOR EXAMPLE, SURROUNDING ORIGAMI UNIT CELLS THAT UNDERGO LARGE AREA CHANGES WITH UNIT CELLS THAT CONTRACT LESS), ARBITRARY OUT-OF-PLANE DISPLACEMENTS CAN BE OBTAINED FROM AN INITIALLY PLANAR, ALBEIT INHOMOGENEOUS, STRUCTURE.

THE FUNDAMENTAL FINDINGS OBTAINED FROM THE PROJECT WILL GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORPHING STRUCTURES FOR SPECIFIC SPACE APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS THE ONES OUTLINED IN THE NASA TA 12 TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP. ACCORDING TO THE TA 12 ROADMAP, EXISTING SPACE STRUCTURES DO NOT INCORPORATE SENSING AND OTHER FUNCTIONS INTO THEIR STRUCTURE. INSTEAD, THESE FUNCTIONS ARE PROVIDED BY DISCRETE SYSTEMS THAT ARE ADDED ONTO THE STRUCTURE, WHICH INCREASES MASS AND VOLUME. ADDITIONALLY, THE ROADMAP STATES THAT INTEGRATION OF THESE SUBSYSTEMS IS AT A LOW TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVEL, AND COULD HAVE A TRANSFORMATIVE EFFECT ON DEEP SPACE AND NEAR-EARTH MISSIONS.

THESE TWO OBJECTIVES FOSTER THREE TASKS: 1) CLASSIFYING AND MAPPING IMPACT FEATURES THROUGH HIRISE, THE HIGH-RESOLUTION CAMERA ON THE MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (MRO). 2) CHARACTERIZING THE MINERALOGY OF MEGABRECCIA THROUGH CRISM, THE IMAGING SPECTROMETER ON THE MRO. 3) CREATING ELEVATION DATA FROM HIRISE IMAGES (HIRISE DEMS) AND USING THESE TO PERFORM STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE ORIENTATIONS AND RELATIVE AGES OF DIFFERENT GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURES OF THE NOACHIAN BASEMENT. A THIRD RESEARCH OBJECTIVE CONCENTRATES ON COUPLING THE MINERALOGY OF THE NOACHIAN BASEMENT OBSERVED VIA CRISM WITH THE GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURES OF THE NOACHIAN BASEMENT OBSERVED VIA HIRISE. THIS OBJECTIVE COMPRISES TWO TASKS: 1) INVESTIGATING #tilde#50 CRISM IMAGES TO MAP THE DIFFERENT MINERALOGIES OF THE BASEMENT. 2) ANALYZING THE GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURES IN HIRISE IMAGES CORRESPONDING TO THE #tilde#50 CRISM IMAGES AND INTEGRATING PREVIOUS MAPPING RESULTS FROM BRAMBLE ET AL. (2017) AND GROUDGE ET AL. (2015). THE LAST RESEARCH OBJECTIVE FOCUSES ON UNDERSTANDING THE GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE NOACHIAN BASEMENT. THIS OBJECTIVE WILL ENCOMPASS THE LAST TWO TASKS OF THE RESEARCH PROJECT, WHERE DATA FROM KEY LOCATIONS WILL BE CO-REGISTERED AND A COLLECTIVE INTERPRETATION OF GEOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND THEIR TIMING WILL BE FORMED PROGRESSIVELY. THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THE PLANETARY SCIENCE DIVISION OBJECTIVE 1.5 OF THE 2014 NASA STRATEGIC PLAN, AS IT ADDRESSES THE GEOLOGICAL PROCESSES DOMINATING ANCIENT MARS AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL FOR LIFE IN A PROPOSED MARS 2020 LANDING SITE. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE PROJECT FULFILLS THE FOLLOWING PLANETARY SCIENCE PROGRAM GOALS FROM THE SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE 2014 SCIENCE PLAN: 1) EXPLORE AND OBSERVE THE OBJECTS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY FORMED AND EVOLVED. 2) ADVANCE THE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROCESSES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM OPERATE, INTERACT AND EVOLVE. 3) EXPLORE AND FIND LOCATIONS WHERE LIFE COULD HAVE EXISTED OR COULD EXIST TODAY. THE PROJECT INVOLVES ALL THESE THREE GOALS AS IT WILL ADDRESS IMPACT PROCESSES, CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL SURFACE FORMATION AND EVOLUTION PROCESSES, AND HABITABILITY POTENTIAL OF ANCIENT MARS.",,,,

DESPITE YEARS OF STUDY, TRUE PREDICTIVE CAPABILITIES FOR SEP EVENTS CONTINUE TO BE HAMPERED BY OPEN FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS REGARDING THEIR GENESIS CLOSE TO ONSET FROM LOW IN THE CORONA, AND HOW THEY POPULATE THE HELIOSPHERE. STUDIES COMBINING THE OBSERVATIONS OF SEPS NEAR EARTH (USING, E.G., ACE, SOHO, AND GOES) WITH THOSE FROM THE TWIN STEREO SPACECRAFT HAVE REVEALED LONGITUDINAL DISTRIBUTIONS THAT DEFY OUR GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF ENERGETIC PARTICLE TRANSPORT, AND POINT TO THE IMPORTANCE OF MAGNETIC FIELD STRUCTURE, CORONAL MASS EJECTION INJECTION AND STRUCTURE. EVENTS SUCH AS 3 NOVEMBER 2011 INDICATE THAT SEPS CAN FILL THE INNER HELIOSPHERE IN #tilde#30 MINUTES, MUCH FASTER THAN EXPECTED. STATISTICAL SURVEYS OF MULTI-SPACECRAFT EVENTS SHOW THAT THE LONGITUDINAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF SEPS VARY SUBSTANTIALLY FROM EVENT TO EVENT AND THE CHARACTERISTICS ARE, SURPRISINGLY, NOT CLEARLY ORGANIZED BY RIGIDITY BUT DO DEPEND ON ENERGY. INTERPRETING THESE OBSERVATIONS REQUIRES AN INTEGRATED APPROACH THAT COMBINES STATE-OF-THE-ART ANALYSIS OF SEP, SOLAR, AND INTERPLANETARY MEASUREMENTS WITH CUTTING-EDGE SIMULATIONS STARTING FROM THE SUN AND EXTENDING THROUGH THE LOW CORONA AND INNER HELIOSPHERE. BY STUDYING BOTH INDIVIDUAL EVENTS AS WELL AS GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS DETERMINED FROM SURVEY STUDIES, WE WILL INVESTIGATE KEY QUESTIONS, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS (CMES) AND LOW-CORONAL SHOCK FORMATION IN THE ACCELERATION OF SEPS, THE EFFECT OF FIELD LINE CONNECTIVITY ON SEP TRANSPORT, AND THE MECHANISMS THAT INFLUENCE VARIOUS SEP CHARACTERISTICS OBSERVED AT 1 AU, SUCH AS RISE TIME, LONGITUDINAL SPREADING, AND COMPOSITIONAL VARIATION. METHODOLOGY: OUR PROPOSED WORK LEVERAGES A NEW SIMULATION TOOL THAT COUPLES REALISTIC, THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC (MHD) SIMULATIONS OF CME EVENTS WITH 3D SOLUTIONS OF THE FOCUSED TRANSPORT EQUATION. VERSIONS OF THIS NEW TOOL (SPE THREAT ASSESSMENT TOOL, OR STAT) WILL HAVE BEEN DELIVERED TO THE CCMC BY THE START OF THE PROPOSED WORK; THE TOOL COMBINES THE PREDICTIVE SCIENCE CORHEL (CORONA-HELIOSPHERE) MHD MODELING SUITE WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE EARTH- MOON-MARS RADIATION ENVIRONMENT MODULE (EMMREM) AND CAN PROVIDE PARTICLE FLUX, FLUENCE, AND DOSE-RATE PREDICTIONS FOR DIFFERENT POINTS IN THE HELIOSPHERE.

TO MEET ITS SCIENCE OBJECTIVES, ISCEA WILL CONDUCT A COMPLETE CENSUS OF THE STAR FORMATION ACTIVITY IN A LARGE MASS-LIMITED SAMPLE OF THE EARLIEST THERMALIZED GALAXY CLUSTERS FROM THE ONGOING 3RD GENERATION 2,500 SQ DEG SURVEY WITH THE SOUTH POLE TELESCOPE (SPT-3G).

OBJECTIVES/APPROACHES. A COMBINATION OF ISOTOPIC, GENOMIC, TRANSCRIPTOMIC, AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATIC APPROACHES WILL BE APPLIED TO: 1) DETERMINE IF MN(II) OXIDATION IS COUPLED TO CO2 FIXATION BY THE CONSORTIUM; AND IF SO, BY WHICH SPECIES. 2) THOROUGHLY EVALUATE THE SPECIES  GENOMES FOR CANDIDATE DETERMINANTS OF MN(II) OXIDATION. MN(II) LITHOTROPHS MUST SOLVE KEY BIOCHEMICAL CHALLENGES NECESSITATING SIGNIFICANT NOVELTIES IN ELECTRON TRANSPORT, E.G. ACTIVATING  LOUSY , HIGH POTENTIAL ELECTRONS FOR RESPIRATION AND CO2 FIXATION, AND DEALING WITH THE PRODUCTION OF A METAL OXIDE SOLID THAT MUST EITHER BE TRANSPORTED OR GENERATED OUTSIDE OF THE CELL. 3) ANALYZE THE TRANSCRIPTOMES OF  STRAIN A  GROWN IN THE MN(II) OXIDIZING CONSORTIUM WITH  STRAIN B , AND THE LATTER GROWN ALONE ON SEVERAL ALTERNATIVE SUBSTRATES.

ON MARS SOME OF THESE LANDFORMS HAVE BEEN OF INTENSE INTEREST DUE TO THEIR RESEMBLANCE TO WATER-CARVED GULLIES ON EARTH AND THEIR RELATIVE YOUTH, POTENTIALLY INDICATING RECENT OR CURRENT AQUEOUS ACTIVITY ON MARS.

WE INTEND TO BUILD ON PREVIOUS WORK BY COUPLING THEORIES FOR ROCK FALL AND DRY GRANULAR FLOW, BEDROCK WEAR, AND LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION TO DEVELOP A QUANTITATIVE MODEL THAT CAN BE USED TO ASSESS THE ORIGIN OF LANDFORMS ON THE MOON AND MARS. 2) WE WILL TEST THE MODEL AGAINST A SERIES OF PHYSICAL EXPERIMENTS ON GULLY FORMATION BY DRY GRANULAR FLOWS WITH COHESIVE AND NON-COHESIVE SUBSTRATES. USING A 5-M LONG CHUTE AND A SYNTHETIC BEDROCK SUBSTRATE, WE WILL INVESTIGATE WHETHER DRY GRAIN FLOWS ALONE CAN CREATE ALCOVE AND CHANNEL MORPHOLOGIES. IF SO, WE WILL TEST WHETHER THEY OCCUR OVER A CERTAIN RANGE OF BED SLOPES AND QUANTIFY THEIR MORPHOLOGIC ATTRIBUTES.

WE WILL GENERATE THE FIRST GLOBAL MAP OF DEBRIS CHUTES ON THE MOON, WHICH LIKELY FORMED IN THE ABSENCE OF WATER, THAT SHARE THE SIMILAR MORPHOLOGIES AS THOSE ON MARS (ALCOVE, CHANNEL AND FAN).

A RIGOROUS UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHENOLOGY OF CARBON CYCLING IN EVERGREEN BOREAL FORESTS HAS BEEN CHALLENGING WITH TRADITIONAL VEGETATION INDICES SUCH AS NDVI AND EVI, BECAUSE THEY RETAIN FOLIAGE AND REMAIN GREEN YEAR-ROUND, BUT THE LIGHT USE EFFICIENCY (LUE) OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS CHANGES RAPIDLY AND DRAMATICALLY. SEASONAL CHANGES IN PIGMENT COMPOSITION ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING LUE CAN BE DETECTED VIA REFLECTANCE (PRI AND CCI) AND PROVIDE INFORMATION ON PLANT PHOTOPROTECTIVE MECHANISMS, BUT THEIR UTILITY FROM SPACE-BORNE PLATFORMS HAS BEEN LIMITED. SOLAR INDUCED FLUORESCENCE (SIF) REFLECTS DYNAMICAL CHANGES ACROSS THE GROWING SEASON DRIVEN BY INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS, AND THUS MAY PROVIDE A CRITICAL TOOL TO EVALUATE ECOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS DRIVING CHANGING GPP. WHILE SPACEBORNE DETECTION OF SIF, PRI, AND CCI HAS YIELDED IMPORTANT INSIGHTS, THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION IS CURRENTLY TOO COARSE TO RESOLVE DETAILED SEASONAL CHANGES. WE PROPOSE TO LINK OBSERVATIONS OF VEGETATION REFLECTANCE AND SIF COLLECTED AT HIGH TEMPORAL RESOLUTION (CONTINUOUS GROUND-BASED HYPERSPECTRAL REFLECTANCE AND SIF WITH CUSTOM PHOTOSPEC SPECTROMETERS) AND HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION (AIRBORNE DATA   CFIS, AVIRISNG) WITH CARBON FLUXES ACROSS A RANGE OF HYDROLOGIC AND CLIMATE REGIMES IN THE NORTHERN BOREAL FOREST. THIS WILL REQUIRE ADVANCING THE MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF HOW PHYSICAL (CANOPY ARCHITECTURE, VIEWING AND ILLUMINATION GEOMETRY) AND ECOPHYSIOLOGICAL (SEASONAL ACCLIMATION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND NEEDLE PIGMENT COMPOSITION) DRIVERS AFFECT TOP-OF-CANOPY SIF AND REFLECTANCE. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, WE WILL LEVERAGE THE STRENGTH OF BOTH SIF AND REFLECTANCE SYNERGISTICALLY TO INTERPRET THEIR RELATIONS TO GPP, AND DEPENDENCE ON OBSERVATION GEOMETRY. TOWARDS THIS GOAL, WE WILL INSTALL OUR TOWER-BASED SPECTROMETER SYSTEM AT A NEW SITE (DELTA JUNCTION, ALASKA), WHICH WILL BE AUGMENTED BY OUR EXISTING NETWORK, REPRESENTATIVE OF DIFFERENT CLIMATOLOGICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL REGIMES (SITES NIWOT RIDGE, COLORADO; SOUTHERN OLD BLACK SPRUCE, SASKATCHEWAN). THESE THREE EVERGREEN-DOMINATED SITES HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT CLIMATIC, RADIATIVE, AND HYDROLOGICAL REGIMES, WHICH ENABLES US TO CHARACTERIZE MUCH OF THE WIDE RANGE OF EVERGREEN ECOSYSTEMS IN THE ABOVE DOMAIN. TOWER-CANOPY AND AIRBORNE SPECTROSCOPY DATA WILL BE COUPLED WITH IN-SITU  MEASUREMENTS AND 3-D RADIATIVE TRANSFER MODELING TO LINK PROCESSES AT A RANGE OF SCALES TO REMOTE SENSING MEASUREMENTS. THIS MULTI-SCALE APPROACH WILL INFORM SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS FROM MODIS, OCO-2, AND TROPOMI, TO SCALE GPP ESTIMATES ACROSS THE BOREAL REGION. OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVES ARE AS FOLLOWS: 1) ESTABLISH A QUANTITATIVE FRAMEWORK TO DESCRIBE THE ECOPHYSIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL MECHANISMS LINKING SURFACE MEASUREMENTS OF SIF AND VEGETATION REFLECTANCE TO GPP AT ESTABLISHED TOWER SITES AND COINCIDENT AIRBORNE CAMPAIGNS. 2) REDUCE UNCERTAINTIES IN SATELLITE-BASED ESTIMATES OF GPP ACROSS THE BOREAL REGION BY APPLYING A PROCESS-BASED UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH THE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL DYNAMICS OF SIF AND VEGETATION REFLECTANCE AT FINE SCALES. THIS WORK DIRECTLY RESPONDS TO THE NASA ABOVE PHASE 2 CALL BY  IMPROVING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE STRUCTURE, FUNCTION, AND PRODUCTIVITY OF TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS AND THEIR INTERACTION WITH ATMOSPHERE AND HYDROSPHERE AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLING.  INTEGRATING OBSERVATIONS MADE AT MULTIPLE SCALES IS CRITICAL TO ELUCIDATE ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION AND WILL DIRECTLY INFORM OUR UNDERSTANDING OF  HOW VULNERABLE OR RESILIENT BOREAL ECOSYSTEMS ARE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE.  TO ACHIEVE THIS, WE WILL DIRECTLY EXAMINE \THE ECOPHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SURFACE AND SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS OF SIF FOR NORTHERN ECOSYSTEMS AND ITS LINK TO ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY.\""""",,,,

A PARTICULAR INTEREST OF ESS CHRONOLOGY IS THE FACT THAT THE TWO MOST PRECISE AGES OF THE OLDEST CAIS DO NOT AGREE WITHIN UNCERTAINTY. THIS DISCREPANCY COULD BE CAUSED BY A FEW BIASES THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNACCOUNTED FOR. THE FIRST QUESTION IS THE RELIABILITY OF PB-PB AGES OF CAIS. PB-PB DATING HAS LONG ASSUMED THAT U ISOTOPES WERE INVARIANT, WHICH WAS CHALLENGED BECAUSE SIGNIFICANT U ISOTOPE VARIABILITY WAS FOUND IN CAIS. GIVEN THAT THE VARIATION IN THE ABSOLUTE 238U/235U CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ACCURACY OF PB-PB AGES, OUTSIDE OF STATED UNCERTAINTIES, BOTH U AND PB ISOTOPES ARE SUP-POSED TO BE MEASURED TO OBTAIN PRECISE AND ACCURATE ABSOLUTE AGES. ALTHOUGH U ISOTOPES CORRECTED AGES OF CAIS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED, AN ASSUMPTION IS ALWAYS MADE THAT THE BULK CAI AND ITS MINERAL CONSTITUENTS HAVE THE SAME U ISOTOPE COMPOSITION, AND THE BULK D238U IS USED TO CORRECT THE AGES DERIVED FROM THE PYROXENE FRACTION. A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE, HOWEVER, SUGGESTS THAT MINERALS IN IGNEOUS SAMPLES, ARE CHARACTERIZED BY DIFFERENT U ISOTOPE COMPOSITIONS. COMPARED TO D238U VAR-IATIONS BETWEEN BULK CAIS, INTERMINERAL VARIATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE SMALLER. THESE SMALLER VARIA-TIONS WOULD STILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT AGES CORRECTIONS, RELATIVE TO THE ERRORS ON THE PB-PB AGES. THE SECOND QUESTION IS THE CONCORDANCE BETWEEN ABSOLUTE AGES (PB-PB) AND RELATIVE AGES (AL-MG). GIVEN THE STILL RELATIVELY RECENT DEVELOPMENT THAT HIGH-PRECISION U ISOTOPE ANALYSES REPRESENT, PUB-LISHED STUDIES ON CAI CHRONOLOGY HAVE TYPICALLY NOT COMBINED U-CORRECTED PB-PB AGE DETERMINA-TION AND AL-MG ANALYSES ON THE SAME BULK CAIS AND/OR THEIR MINERAL FRACTIONS. TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF ESS CHRONOLOGY, AL-MG SYSTEMATICS ALSO SHOULD BE REVISITED FOR THE SAME SET OF SAMPLES. HERE, WE PROPOSE TO ASSESS THE RELIABILITY OF CAI AGES BY CONDUCTING HIGH-PRECISION ANALY-SIS OF THE U AND AL-MG SYSTEMATICS IN MINERAL SEPARATES FROM CAIS THAT WILL ALSO BE DATED USING THE PB-PB METHOD. THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTION OF THE PROPOSED WORK WILL BE TO REVISIT THE PB-PB AGES OF CAIS, WHICH ARE THE OLDEST KNOWN SOLIDS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. GIVEN THAT SUBSTANTIAL U ISOTOPIC VARIABILITY EXISTS IN CAIS, ASSESSING THE HOMOGENEITY OF U ISOTOPE COMPOSITIONS IN DIFFERENT MINER-AL FRACTIONS WITHIN CAIS CAN PROVIDE A MORE SUBTLE VIEW OF THE IMPACT OF U ISOTOPIC COMPOSITIONS ON THE CORRECTION OF PB-PB AGES. THIS, IN TURN, WILL ALLOW US TO ASSESS THE LEVEL OF AGREEMENT/ DISCREPANCY BETWEEN ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE CHRONOLOGIES. THE PROPOSED WORK IS HIGHLY RELE-VANT TO NASA S HIGH-LEVEL STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 1.1: UNDERSTAND THE SUN, EARTH, SOLAR SYSTEM, AND UNIVERSE. THERE ARE FOUR MAIN OBJECTIVES IN THIS PROPOSAL: OBJECTIVE 1: TO MEASURE THE D238U ON MINERAL SEPARATES FROM COARSE-GRAINED CAIS. OBJECTIVE 2: TO CHARACTERIZE, BOTH IN-SITU AND BY SOLUTION, THE AL-MG SYSTEMATICS OF THE SAME CAIS. OBJECTIVE 3: TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER SYSTEMATIC DIFFERENCES IN 238U/235U EXIST BETWEEN DIFFERENT MINERAL PHASES IN CAIS, ASSESS THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT ON PB-PB AGE CORRECTIONS. OBJECTIVE 4: TO COMBINE THE PB-PB CORRECTED AGES AND THE AL-MG DATA TO REVISIT ESS CHRONOLOGY. FOR THE PROPOSED WORK, SIX COARSE-GRAINED CAIS HAVE ALREADY BEEN EXTRACTED AND CHARACTERIZED. EPOXY MOUNTS OF THESE CAIS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR IN-SITU AL-MG ANALYSIS BY SIMS. A REPRESENTA-TIVE FRAGMENT OF THE BULK CAIS WILL BE KEPT FOR SOLUTION WORK OF AL-MG SYSTEMATICS, WHILE REMAIN-ING SAMPLES WILL BE CRUSHED AND SEPARATED INTO MINERAL FRACTIONS WITH THE COMBINATION OF HAND-PICKING AND MAGNETIC SEPARATION. MINERAL SEPARATES AND BULK CAIS WILL BE DISSOLVED AND PURIFIED WITH WELL-ESTABLISHED PROTOCOLS. MG AND U ISOTOPES WILL BE MEASURED BY MC-ICPMS.",,,,
