HOWEVER, GOLDILOCKS ISN&#039;T SIMPLY ABOUT TEMPERATURE. IT&#039;S ABOUT PORRIDGE. WHAT KIND OF TELESCOPE CAN SENSE HOME COOKING WITHIN THE HABITABLE ZONES OF OUR STELLAR NEIGHBORHOOD? THE EXTRAORDINARY DEMANDS MADE BY EXOPLANET DISCOVERY INCLUDE TELESCOPE APERTURES OF UNPRECEDENTED ANGULAR RESOLUTION AND SENSITIVITY. HOWEVER, THAT BALLGAME CANNOT EVEN BEGIN WITHOUT A METHOD TO OCCLUDE OR NULL THE HOST STAR AND REMOVE ITS GLARE. AS IF THAT WERE NOT TROUBLE ENOUGH, HABITABLE PLANET DISCOVERY NECESSITATES EXQUISITE SPECTROGRAPHIC CAPABILITY. THE NECESSITY IS NOT LOST ON NASA. THE DECADAL SURVEY OF ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS MAKES IT QUITE CLEAR THAT EXOPLANET DISCOVERY MUST INCLUDE A SPECTROSCOPY COMPONENT. YET THERE ARE NO EXISTING HABITABLE PLANET ZONE FINDERS WITH SPECTROGRAPHS AND FEW ARE PLANNED. HOMES (HOLOGRAPHIC OPTICAL METHOD FOR EXOPLANET SPECTROSCOPY) IS A SPACE TELESCOPE DESIGNED TO HIT ALL OF THESE CRITERIA. ITS DOUBLE DISPERSION ARCHITECTURE EMPLOYS A HOLOGRAPHIC OPTICAL ELEMENT AS A PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IN CONJUNCTION WITH A NOVEL SECONDARY SPECTRAL INTERFEROMETER. UNLIKE MIRRORS AND LENSES, THE HOLOGRAMS ARE THIN AND FLAT. THEY CAN BE FABRICATED ON THIN GOSSAMER MEMBRANES AND STRETCHED OVER SPACE FRAMES COVERING THOUSANDS OF SQUARE METERS. THIS PROVIDES THE SCALE OF COLLECTOR NEEDED TO CAPTURE THE PHOTONS FROM VERY FAINT SOURCES LIKE EXOPLANETS AND BRING THEM TO A FOCUS. BECAUSE HOLOGRAPHIC OPTICS FOCUS BY THE PROCESS OF DISPERSION, THEY ARE INTRINSICALLY SPECTROGRAPHIC PROVIDING A WEALTH OF DETAIL ABOUT THE COMPOSITION OF THE IMAGES THEY FORM. ADD TO THIS A NOVEL NOTCH FILTER TO DIM THE STAR THAT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE SPECTROGRAPHIC IMAGE, AND HOMES IS A CONCEPT THAT ADDRESSES THE DEMANDING SPECIFICATIONS OF A TELESCOPE TO FIND HABITABLE PLANETS WITHIN 30 LIGHT YEARS OF EARTH.",,,,,,,,,

HIADS OFFER CONSIDERABLE SYSTEM MASS AND VOLUME SAVINGS OVER RIGID AEROSHELL TECHNOLOGY.  TO ADVANCE HIAD DEVELOPMENT AND IDENTIFY TECHNICAL CHALLENGES WITH DEVELOPMENT OF A 10 METER CLASS OF HIAD, TESTING OF INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS IS NEEDED TO MEET PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR POTENTIAL FLIGHT DEMONSTRATIONS.  ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS DEVELOPING SOFT-GOOD MATERIALS AND FABRICS FOR A DEPLOYABLE THERMAL PROTECTION SYSTEM (TPS).  THIS STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) DEFINES A FABRICATION EFFORT TO BE PERFORMED BY THE CONTRACTOR THAT WILL DEMONSTRATE AN ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE A LOW-ANGLE BIASED TWO DIMENSIONAL FABRIC THROUGH A BRAIDING PROCESS THAT OTHERWISE CANNOT BE ACHIEVED USING A STANDARD FABRIC WEAVING PROCESS. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO ESTABLISH A MANUFACTURING METHOD THAT USES BRITTLE SILICON CARBIDE CERAMIC YARNS TO OBTAIN A NOMINAL +/- 60  BIASED BIAXIAL BRAIDED TUBE WITH A DIAMETER OF 24 INCHES OF SUFFICIENT LENGTH TO MANUFACTURE A DEPLOYABLE TPS WITH A DIAMETER OF AT LEAST 20 FEET. THE WORK DETAILED HEREIN IS DEFINED AS A SUBSCALE MANUFACTURING EFFORT THAT WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING INDUSTRY STANDARD BRAIDING METHODS AND EQUIPMENT TO OBTAIN A REFRACTORY CLOTH OF LENGTH AND QUALITY SUFFICIENT FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF A DEPLOYABLE TPS.  2.0",OBJECTIVES  THE CONTRACTOR SHALL IDENTIFY AND DEMONSTRATE BRAID FABRICATION METHODS BASED ON THE REQUIREMENTS IN THIS SOW.  THE CONTRACT SCOPE OF WORK SHALL INCLUDE THE TASKS LISTED BELOW.  THE DETAILED TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THESE TASKS ARE PROVIDED IN TASKS 3.2 AND 3.4 OF THIS SOW.  SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF TASK 3.2 IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION TO PROCEED TO TASK 3.4.  THE GOVERNMENT DECISION WHETHER OR NOT TO PROCEED WITH TASK 3.4 WILL BE PROVIDED FOLLOWING THE MIDTERM CONTRACT REVIEW TASK 3.3.  THE SOW FOR THE HIAD ADVANCED LARGE-SCALE BRAIDING DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION SOW INCLUDE TECHNICAL TASKS IDENTIFIED AS:  3.1,KICK-OFF MEETING 3.2,SUBSCALE BRAIDED FABRIC 3.3,MIDTERM CONTRACT REVIEW 3.4,LARGE SCALE BRAIDED FABRIC 3.5,FINAL CONTRACT REVIEW    3.0,"TASK TECHNICAL DETAILS  THE PRIMARY WORK PROVIDED FOR IN THE CONTRACT IS DIVIDED INTO TWO MAJOR TASKS FOR THE PURPOSE OF, FIRST DEMONSTRATING PROOF OF CONCEPT THROUGH A PRELIMINARY FABRICATION TRIAL USING A LOWER TEMPERATURE CAPABLE CANDIDATE CERAMIC YARN MATERIAL, AND SECOND, EXTENDING THOSE CAPABILITIES SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED AND DEMONSTRATED TO A HIGHER TEMPERATURE CAPABLE SILICON CARBIDE YARN.  THE LOWER TEMPERATURE CANDIDATE YARN SHALL BE NEXTELTM 440 WHICH HAS BEEN CHOSEN BECAUSE IT IS A LOWER COST MATERIAL THAT POSSESSES MECHANICAL AND MANUFACTURING DURABILITY PROPERTIES COMPARABLE TO A HIGHER TEMPERATURE CAPABLE, AND HIGHER COST CG-NICALONTM YARN.  THE SUBSCALE BRAIDED FABRIC TASK 3.2 ADDRESSES THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BRAIDING BRITTLE CERAMIC YARNS.  SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF TASK 3.2 IS REQUIRED TO ASSESS THE PROBABILITY OF SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING THE LARGE-SCALE BRAIDING TASK 3.4.  AN EXAMINATION OF THE PROGRESS PERFORMED DURING THE SUBSCALE BRAIDED TASK 3.2 SHALL BE CONDUCTED THROUGH A MID-TERM REVIEW.  FOLLOWING SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE TASKS 3.2 AND 3.3, THE GOVERNMENT WILL ASSESS THE RISKS TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING TASK 3.4 AND MAKE A DECISION ON EXECUTING TASK 3.4.  THE CONTRACTOR MUST HAVE A WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION TO PROCEED FROM THE GOVERNMENT BEFORE EXECUTING WORK UNDER THE LARGE-SCALE BRAIDED FABRIC TASK 3.4.  3.1","KICK-OFF MEETING WITHIN 7 DAYS OF THE CONTRACT AWARD DATE, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PARTICIPATE IN A KICK-OFF MEETING THAT WILL BE HELD VIA TELEPHONE AND WEB CONFERENCING.  THE PURPOSE OF THE KICK-OFF MEETING IS TO PROVIDE A FORUM AT WHICH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE CONTRACTOR CAN REVIEW THE DETAILED REQUIREMENTS DESCRIBED IN THIS SOW.  THE CONTRACTOR IS NOT REQ"""

IN THIS HYBRID APPROACH, THE CONVENTIONAL METALLIC WEB IS REPLACED WITH A COMPOSITE ELEMENT. THIS ALTERNATIVE DESIGN GENERATES A SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT REDUCTION AND THE POTENTIAL FOR THE REDUCTION OF NOISE AND VIBRATION. THE PHASE 2 PROGRAM WILL MAKE THE FIRST LARGE SCALE HYBRID GEARS THAT CAN BE RUN IN A ROTATING GEAR RIG WITH IMPOSED TORQUE LOADING. SEVERAL FULL SCALE GEARS WILL BE MADE AS WELL AS FULL SCALE TEST ELEMENTS. TEST RESULTS FROM FULL SCALE TESTING WILL BE APPLIED TO COMPUTER SIMULATION MODELS. THIS EFFORT WILL APPLY TOPOLOGY OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES TO PREDICT THE BEST DESIGN OF THE GEAR ELEMENTS. THIS SHOULD ENABLE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EFFICIENT DESIGNS THAN THOSE FABRICATED AND TESTED IN THE PHASE 1 PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM WILL ALSO EXPLORE A POWER TRANSMISSION SYSTEM THAT INTEGRATES GEAR AND SHAFT INTO A SINGLE STRUCTURE. IT IS HOPED THAT THIS INTEGRATED SYSTEM WILL BENEFIT WEIGHT, NOISE AND TOLERANCE OF MISALIGNMENTS.",,,,,,,,,

BECAUSE THE LC BEAM IS LESS THAN 10 MICRORADIANS WIDE AND THE EARTH AT APOGEE IS 32 MICRORADIANS WIDE, AS SEEN FROM MARS, LC BEAM JITTER CAUSED BY SPACECRAFT BASE MOTION MUST BE REDUCED TO SUB-MICRORADIAN LEVELS TO ENABLE BEACONLESS OPTICAL BEAM POINTING. TO MEET THE NEED, NASA IS SEEKING INNOVATIVE COMPACT, LIGHTWEIGHT, SPACE-QUALIFIABLE VIBRATION ISOLATION PLATFORMS FOR PAYLOADS MASSING BETWEEN 3 AND 50 KG THAT REQUIRE LESS THAN 15 W OF POWER AND MASS LESS THAN 3 KG THAT WILL ATTENUATE AN INTEGRATED ANGULAR DISTURBANCE OF 150 UR TO LESS THAN 0.5 MICRORADIANS (1-SIGMA), FROM<0.1 HZ TO #tilde#500 HZ. ATA HAS A LONG TRACK RECORD OF PRODUCING STABILIZED PLATFORMS TO HOST SMALL OPTICAL PAYLOADS. BUILDING ON A PREVIOUS NASA SBIR, ATA NOW PRODUCES THE STABLE PLATFORM USED IN NASA\'S LLST AND LCRD PROGRAMS. ATA WILL CREATE A COMPACT, LIGHTWEIGHT ISOLATION PLATFORM (CLIP) THAT COULD HOST THE LC COLLIMATOR TELESCOPE AND PROVIDE A STABILIZED PLATFORM TO PREVENT THE 150-MICRORADIAN SPACECRAFT DISTURBANCE ENVIRONMENT FROM REACHING THE LC TERMINAL. ADVANCES IN THE SUSPENSION FLEXURE, THE PLATFORM STRUCTURE, AND ACTUATORS WILL BE REQUIRED TO MEET THE SIZE, WEIGHT AND POWER REQUIREMENTS. ONE CHALLENGING REQUIREMENT IS THAT AN ANGULAR-MOTION SENSOR IS REQUIRED FOR THE CONTROL SYSTEM. GYROS EXIST THAT CAN MEASURE ADEQUATELY BUT THEY ARE TOO HEAVY, TOO LARGE, AND USE TOO MUCH POWER. ATA WILL DEVELOP A SMALL, LIGHTWEIGHT, NANORADIAN-CLASS ANGULAR NOISE CAPACITIVE ANGULAR POSITION SENSOR (CAPS). THE SENSOR WILL HAVE LOW POWER AND HIGH RELIABILITY, WHICH ATA WILL DEMONSTRATE BY PRODUCING TRL 4 PROTOTYPES IN PHASE I. ATA WILL DEVELOP THE CLIP, A 0.5 MICRORADIAN RESIDUAL MOTION STABLE PLATFORM, IN PHASE II FOR PROGRAMS LIKE IROC.",,,,,,,,,

IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, SCIENTISTS HAVE PROPOSED TO USE THESE DISPOSABLE FLOPS (WHICH OTHERWISE WOULD BE WASTED IDLING) TO COMPRESS AND DECOMPRESS THE COMMUNICATED DATA SO TO EFFECTIVELY SPEED UP THE UNDERLYING APPLICATION.  ALTHOUGH THE IDEA BEARS TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL, EFFORTS IN THIS DIRECTION HAVE CONSISTENTLY RENDERED VERY POOR RESULTS, WITH TYPICAL RESULTING SPEEDUPS AVERAGING BELOW 1.5X. IN THIS PROJECT, WE IDENTIFY THE STRONGEST REASONS WHY TRADITIONAL DATA COMPRESSION HAS FALLEN SHORT IN TERMS OF SPEEDUP PERFORMANCE FOR HPC, AND PROPOSE NOVEL TECHNIQUES PARTICULARLY CRAFTED FOR GROUNDBREAKING PERFORMANCE WITHIN THE HPC FRAMEWORK. PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW THAT THESE TECHNIQUES BREAK THE 10X SPEEDUP MARKUP CONSISTENTLY FOR A WIDE CLASS OF HPC APPLICATIONS OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE TO NASA.

Research will be conducted in the Brazilian and Peruvian Amazon, at sites near Manaus and Iquitos. Activities will build on and extend research conducted under NASA-funded LBA projects. Current approaches for sampling tropical tree diversity rely on field investigations that sample only a small portion of key environmental gradients. This project will bring together a close coupling of extensive field measurements of tree diversity patterns, satellite remote sensing to enable sampling across regional disturbance gradients, and community simulation models to better understand the mechanisms responsible for observed patterns at regional scales. The overarching hypothesis is that tree species community assembly patterns at the landscape scale, driven by episodic disturbance events, differ significantly from community assembly patterns at the local (<100 ha) scale. The project has four major goals: First, episodic tree mortality disturbance will be mapped over large Amazon landscapes using Landsat imagery, enabling the development of disturbance chronosequences covering more than 20 years. Second, the chronosequence data will be used to direct extensive field sampling to quantify tree species patterns across the landscape as a function of disturbance intensity, and time since disturbance. Third, the detection threshold for shifts in PFTs from the competitor to colonizer guild will be explored using hyperspectral (Hyperion) imagery. Fourth, a tractable community assembly model will be developed to explore which community assemblage mechanisms best fit the observed landscape-level patterns. Results will provide an improved understanding of shifts in tree diversity and PFTs with disturbance, and will help inform future NASA missions including DESDynI and HyspIRI. This project will directly address the stated goal of better understanding the current condition of Amazon forest biodiversity, and how it is changing over time.",,,,,,,,,

AS OUR EXPERIENCE OF VLBI HARDWARE UPGRADE SHOWED, IMPROVEMENT OF OBSERVING HARDWARE ALONE IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR IMPROVING THE ACCURACY OF STATION POSITION DETERMINATION. REACHING THE GOAL OF THE GLOBAL GEODETIC OBSERVING SYSTEM FOR THE ACCURACY OF THE INTERNATIONAL TERRESTRIAL REFERENCE FRAME (ITRF) 1 MM AND ITS STABILITY 0.1 MM/YR SET IN THE DOCUMENT &quot;MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF A GLOBAL SOCIETY ON A CHANGING PLANET IN 2020&quot; NECESSARILY REQUIRES A BREAKTHROUGH IN MODELING THE PATH DELAY IN THE NEUTRAL ATMOSPHERE. THE ESSENCE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR COMPUTING PATH DELAY THROUGH THE NEUTRAL ATMOSPHERE BY DIRECT INTEGRATION OF EQUATIONS OF RADIO WAVE PROPAGATION USING THE OUTPUT OF NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS OF A NEW GENERATION: REANALYSIS MODEL MERRA, OPERATIONAL MODEL GEOS-5.6 DEVELOPED AT THE NASA GLOBAL MODELING AND ASSIMILATION OFFICE, AND THE CLIMATE FORECAST SYSTEM REANALYSIS DEVELOPED BY NOAA. THE PATH DELAYS WILL BE COMPUTED IN THE FORM THAT CAN BE EASILY UTILIZED BY EXISTING SOFTWARE FOR PROCESSING VLBI, GPS, AND DORIS OBSERVATIONS. THE GOAL IS TO MODEL THE ATMOSPHERE PATH DELAY BETTER AND TO PROVIDE MORE RELIABLE ESTIMATES OF STATION POSITIONS AND SATELLITE ORBITS. OUR APPROACH HINGES ON A SOLUTION OF THREE PROBLEMS THAT WE FOUND IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE PILOT STUDY. THIS INCLUDES 1) DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFICIENT NUMERICAL ALGORITHM FOR EXPANDING THE REFRACTIVITY FIELD OVER A FOUR-DIMENSIONAL TENSOR PRODUCT OF B-SPLINES THAT TRANSFORMS A SET OF DISCRETE REFRACTIVITIES DERIVED FROM THE GRIDDED OUTPUT OF NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS INTO A CONTINUUM FUNCTION WITH SMOOTH PARTIAL DERIVATIVES. 2) FORMULATION OF RADIO WAVE PROPAGATION THROUGH A HETEROGENEOUS CONTINUOUS MEDIUM AS A VARIATIONAL PROBLEM WHICH SOLUTION IS REDUCED TO A SYSTEM OF NON-LINEAR ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF THE 4TH ORDER. 3) DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFICIENT INTERPOLATION METHOD FOR SLANTED PATH DELAYS COMPUTED FOR A GIVEN STATION. THAT ALLOWS TO DECOUPLE COMPUTATION OF PATH DELAY IN THE NEUTRAL ATMOSPHERE FROM GEODETIC DATA ANALYSIS. ALTHOUGH THE NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS CURRENTLY ARE NOT ACCURATE TO THE LEVEL THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO COMPUTE PATH DELAY WITH THE ACCURACY THAT MATCHES THE ACCURACY OF SPACE GEODESY MEASUREMENTS, THEIR USE SHIFTS THE PARADIGM OF A TREATMENT OF PATH DELAY IN THE NEUTRAL ATMOSPHERE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED OVER 40 YEARS AGO. INSTEAD OF USING IN-SITU SURFACE METEOROLOGICAL DATA THAT PROVIDE ESTIMATES OF ZENITH PATH DELAYS WITH A TYPICAL ERROR OF 150-250 MM AND ESTIMATING THE REMAINING DELAYS USING PARTIAL DERIVATIVES, THE SO-CALLED MAPPING FUNCTION, DERIVED FROM A COARSE REGRESSION MODEL, WE CAN COMPUTE THE SLANTED PATH DELAY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE OBSERVING SOURCE OR SATELLITE WITH THE ACCURACY OF 10-15 MM OF THE ZENITH PATH DELAY EQUIVALENT AND TO ESTIMATE RESIDUAL DELAY USING PARTIAL DERIVATIVES COMPUTED FROM THE NUMERICAL WEATHER MODEL. ADVANCES IN NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS WILL MAKE UNNECESSARY ESTIMATION OF PATH DELAY CAUSED BY THE NEUTRAL ATMOSPHERE IN THE FUTURE WHEN EVEN MORE PRECISE NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS WILL BE DEVELOPED. THE PRESENT PROPOSAL SETS THE PATH FOR SUCH A SHIFT IN DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE. THE BENEFITS THAT WE CAN ENJOY RIGHT NOW ARE REDUCING SYSTEMATIC ERRORS ORIGINATING FROM THE A PRIORI MAPPING FUNCTION AND SATISFACTORY MODELING OF THE PATH DELAY AZIMUTHAL DEPENDENCE THAT MAKES ESTIMATION OF THE SO-CALLED TROPOSPHERE GRADIENTS UNNECESSARY. THIS WILL RESULT IN IMPROVEMENT OF STATION POSITION REPEATABILITY AND GETTING A MORE ACCURATE TERRESTRIAL REFERENCE FRAME AND SATELLITE ORBITS. ACCURATE SATELLITE ORBITS ARE THE KEY ELEMENT OF MEAN SEA LEVEL CHANGE MEASUREMENTS.

THE INNOVATION CONSISTS OF A HIGH TEMPERATURE ALKALI METAL VARIABLE CONDUCTANCE HEAT PIPE (VCHP) INTEGRATED WITH A TWO-PHASE HEAT COLLECTION / TRANSPORT PACKAGE FROM THE GENERAL PURPOSE HEAT SOURCE (GPHS) STACK TO THE STIRLING CONVERTOR HEATER HEAD. THE THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM COLLECTS THE HEAT FROM THE GPHS MODULES, AND DELIVERS HEAT AS REQUIRED TO THE STIRLING SYSTEM. ANY EXCESS HEAT IS REMOVED BY THE VCHP. EXCESS HEAT MUST BE REMOVED WHEN THE STIRLING SYSTEM IS SHUT DOWN, OR IN THE EARLY STAGES OF A MISSION POWERED BY A SHORT-LIFE RADIOISOTOPE. IN PHASE I, IT WAS DEMONSTRATED EXPERIMENTALLY AND THEORETICALLY THAT THE VCHP ALLOWS THE STIRLING CONVERTOR TO: STOP DURING TRANSIT TO VENUS, PRE-COOL THE SYSTEM BEFORE RE-ENTRY, WORK ON VENUS AND EXECUTE BRIEF STOPPAGES ON VENUS. THE RESERVOIR IS EXPOSED TO THE ENVIRONMENT TEMPERATURE DURING THE MISSION AND THIS IS A KEY FOR THE HTTMS TO WORK PASSIVELY. THE OTHER COMPONENT OF THE SYSTEM, THE TWO-PHASE HEAT TRANSPORT PACKAGE (HTP), MINIMIZES THE TEMPERATURE DROP BETWEEN THE MULTI-GPHS STACK AND THE HEATER HEAD. IN PHASE II, A FULL SCALE HTTMS WILL BE DESIGNED AND A REPRESENTATIVE MULTI-SEGMENT OF THE FULL SCALE HTTMS WILL BE BUILD AND TESTED IN RELEVANT ENVIRONMENT.

DURING THE LONG LUNAR DAY, THE THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM MUST REMOVE THE WASTE HEAT FROM THE ELECTRONICS AND BATTERIES KEEP THEM WITHIN THE ACCEPTABLE TEMPERATURE LIMIT. SINCE THE HEATER POWER AVAILABILITY IS RESTRICTED, A VARIABLE THERMAL LINK IS THEREFORE REQUIRED TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF HEAT THAT IS REMOVED FROM THE ELECTRONICS AND RADIATED TO SPACE DURING THE LONG LUNAR NIGHT. CONVENTIONAL LOOP HEAT PIPES (LHPS) CAN PROVIDE THE REQUIRED VARIABLE THERMAL CONDUCTANCE, BUT THEY CONSUME ELECTRICAL POWER TO SHUT DOWN THE HEAT TRANSFER. OUR INNOVATION ADDS A THERMAL CONTROL VALVE (TCV) TO THE LHP, ALLOWING IT TO PASSIVELY SHUT OFF WITHOUT CONSUMING ANY ELECTRICAL POWER. THIS IS IMPORTANT SINCE THERE IS A SEVERE PENALTY FOR ELECTRICAL POWER CONSUMPTION: SUPPLYING 1 W IN A PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEM REQUIRES ROUGHLY 5 KG OF EXTRA EQUIPMENT. THE TCV USED IN THE LHP HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY SELECTED FOR THERMAL CONTROL IN THE PUMPED LOOP ON THE MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY.

Turbofans are replaced in this approach by ducted fans driven by high power density electric motors. The electrical power is generated by a gas turbine coupled to a high speed, high power density generator. However, the turbo-electric propulsion concept relies on the availability of electric machines with power densities (kW/m3) and specific power (kW/kg) far larger than that of conventional electric machines. Fully superconducting rotating machines have the potential to match the requirements of turbo-electric propulsion and present enabling technology for this application. Superconducting machines require operation at cryogenic temperature that can be achieved by using closed-cycle cryocoolers or liquid cryogen flow such as liquid hydrogen (LH2) that could also be used as energy carrier for propulsion. The development of turbo-electric propulsion for aircrafts requires accurate sizing of superconducting machines and performing the pertinent trade-off analysis to determine the optimum materials and operating temperature. NASA is currently using sizing models for superconducting machines developed by Dr. and his colleagues. These models were developed as part of the NASA URETI on Aeropropulsion Power and Technology (UAPT) and at the Advanced Magnet Lab (AML). The existing models are based on analytical modeling of electric machines published by Miller and Hughes and estimates of the mass of the different components of the machines assuming a given active length. Important AC loss calculations in this model are based on experimental data available in the literature AC losses in superconducting stators are very challenging to estimate as the rotating field from the rotor is phase shifted relative to the phase current which depends on the angular stator position. Furthermore, the magnitude of the applied field is not uniformly distributed, and the armature reaction tends to demagnetize the machine impacting the AC losses. While the outstanding potential of the turbo-electric propulsion has been successfully demonstrated through a few projects, higher fidelity models are needed to perform a more accurate assessment at the system level. AML proposes to develop the next generation of sizing model based on a complete 3D analysis of superconducting machines using semi-analytical methods to calculate the magnetic flux density distribution including all components of the machine. The model will include all relevant areas of design including electromagnetics, thermodynamics and mechanics. Based on semi-analytical methods, the model will enable rapid calculations as needed for system optimization. The model to be developed will be fully validated, first numerically using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and finally experimentally using a superconducting machine developed at AML. Some aspects of fully superconducting machines including the AC losses and the fault behavior have not been sufficiently studied in the past to build reliable models. We therefore propose to focus the experimental validation on those important aspects: The proposed physics-based model will allow to design and optimize aircrafts based on turbo-electric propulsion, which is the first step towards the development of the next generation of more efficient aircrafts with reduced toxic emissions and noise pollution. Such aircrafts would also allow take-off and landing during the night in cities and would dramatically reduce the cost of operation and maintenance.",,,,,,,,,

Such an architecture enhances the adaptability and survivability of space systems, while also shortening development timelines and reducing the barrier-to-entry for participation in the national security space industry. The program is predicated on the development of open interface standards-from the physical wireless link layer, through the network protocol stack, and including the real-time resource sharing middleware and cluster flight logic that can enable the emergence of a space global commons which would enhance the mutual security posture of all participants through interdependence. A key program goal is the industry-wide promulgation of these open interface standards for the sustainment and development of future fractionated systems.",,,,,,,,,

Rather than being an extension of the school day, these programs provide a safe place for students to develop skills and explore topics not covered in typical school curricula. There is significant interest from government agencies and community stakeholders in establishing and sustaining afterschool programming around the country. Increasing attention is being paid to teaching science in afterschool programs, asunder-privileged students who do not always have exposure or access to high-quality engagement in science often attend them. Such programs are a good vehicle to reach people who rarely participate in NASA education programs. Afterschool providers are looking for quality programming that has been designed for their unique setting, but there is an unfortunate deficiency in science content designed for out-of-school time. There is thus a tremendous opportunity for teaching astronomy in the afterschool setting, and most students and program leaders alike have an innate fascination with the cosmos. Afterschool Universe is a fun, hands-on afterschool astronomy program that introduces participants to a variety of basic concepts in astronomy. It is designed for middle school students, as research shows that middle school is a critical time in the development of attitudes about science and career options, especially in girls. This program was developed by the Astrophysics Science Division at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in 2006 and was pilot tested in 2006 and 2007. It has been disseminated nationally since early 2008 through two-day training workshops for program implementers. Over 300 afterschool program providers have been trained at these workshops, but the frequency and geographical reach of these trainings inherently limit the spread of the program. We propose to increase the efficacy and impact of the Afterschool Universe dissemination effort through a train-the-trainer method that taps into established organizations and networks that support afterschool programming. We will conduct an intensive three-day training workshop for selected staff from these organizations, then support attendees to conduct their own training workshops within their networks. This train-the-trainer method will permit a much more rapid dissemination of the program and provide a larger geographical reach than is currently possible. By training a small group of trainers, we can reach hundreds of implementers and thousands of students who would not otherwise learn much about astronomy. This is a fitting effort to build upon the excitement of the International Year of Astronomy in 2009, as it will provide both leader and student participants with continued exploration of the universe in the years that follow.",,,,,,,,,

THIS PUMP WILL FULFILL SEVERAL NEEDS STATED IN SBIR RESEARCH TOPIC, H2.01: CRYOGENIC FLUID MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES. ZERO GRAVITY CRYOGENIC CONTROL DEVICES (SPRAY BARS AND MIXER), REQUIRE CRYOGENIC LIQUIDS TO BE PUMPED EFFICIENTLY. PROPELLANT CONDITIONING AND DENSIFICATION TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRE COMPACT, EFFICIENT PUMPS. BROAD AREA COOLING OF CRYOPROPELLANT SHIELDS CAN BE FACILITATED BY THE PUMPING OF A COLD GAS SUCH AS HELIUM IN A LOOP FROM A CRYOCOOLER TO A SHIELD. VARIOUS METHODS OF LIQUEFACTION OF OXYGEN SUCH AS PASSIVE RADIATIVE COOLING CAN BE ENABLED BY CRYOGENIC PUMPING. OTHER AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS SUCH AS A FUEL PUMP FOR LIQUID HYDROGEN FUELED AIRCRAFT. A COMPACT, RELIABLE, AND LIGHT WEIGHT PUMP FOR CRYOGENIC LIQUIDS CURRENTLY DOES NOT EXIST. OUR SUBCONTRACTOR, BALL AEROSPACE AND TECHNOLOGIES, HAS IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR SUCH A PUMP SEVERAL YEARS AGO, BUT HAS NOT FOUND A SUITABLE AVAILABLE PRODUCT. SCROLL PUMPS HAVE SEVERAL ADVANTAGES OVER OTHER PUMP TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING BEING COMPACT, LIGHT WEIGHT, RELIABLE AND EFFICIENT. THE PUMP CAN BE HERMETICALLY ISOLATED FROM THE DRIVE MOTOR BY THE USE OF A MAGNETIC COUPLER, ALLOWING THE PUMP TO BE HERMETICALLY SEALED. BECAUSE OF THE ORBITAL MOTION, THE SCROLLS CAN BE PLACED IN A METAL BELLOWS THAT ARE SEALED TO THE HOUSING WHICH ISOLATES THE LIQUID VIA A VACUUM ENCLOSURE FOR THERMAL ISOLATION. THE BEARINGS CAN BE PLACED ON THERMALLY ISOLATING ARMS, SO THEY DO NOT NEED TO OPERATE AT CRYOGENIC TEMPERATURES. SCROLL PUMPS HAVE CONSIDERABLE TECHNICAL HERITAGE RELEVANT TO THIS APPLICATION. AIR SQUARED HAS DEVELOPED AND SUCCESSFULLY TESTED SCROLL PUMPS FOR LIQUIDS AND FOR CRYOGENIC GASSES. AIR SQUARED HAS DEVELOPED SEVERAL COMPACT PUMPS FOR PUMPING AIR WHICH HAS SIMILAR VISCOSITY AND COMPRESSIBILITY TO LIQUID HYDROGEN.",,,,,,,,,

In the Flint River watershed, there has been an increase in the development and urbanization affecting the water quality, quantity, and its aquatic inhabitants. As the population continues to increase, there will be a shift in land use from forested and agricultural uses to more urban and residential uses. A variety of environmental and economic implications come as a result of this shift in land use. It is important to predict these future shifts in land use to both understand and reduce any negative impacts. The major goal of this research is to develop and utilize methodology in the form of descriptive and predictive models, which will facilitate the determination of factors driving LUCC (Land Use Cover Change) in the Flint River watershed. I will analyze historical and current satellite remotely sensed and aerial photography data to detect potential land-use pattern and develop a comprehensive digital GIS geodatabase for the study area. During normal- to low-flow periods, study sites within the Flint River Watershed will be assessed for stream flow measurements. Basic stream water quality measurements including pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids, alkalinity, hardness, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, and bacterial colony forming units will also be taken during periods of normal to high flow. We expect that basic stream water quality measurements will be poorer in stream reaches associated with increasing urbanization and devegetation. At NASA Centers the Earth's surface characteristics and their linkages to the atmosphere and hydrologic cycles are being analyzed and modeled using remotely sensed data. Measurements from satellite and aircraft sensors, in conjunction with in situ measurements, are used to study spatial and spectral resolution and temporal variability effects on determination of land surface energy fluxes, hydrometeorological characteristics, and biophysical components. These technologies used at NASA Centers are related to my proposed research and will help me throughout my findings.",,,,,,,,,

Alaska is an ideal place on which to focus such exhibits. Surface temperatures in the Arctic are increasing at twice the global rate and Alaska residents are already feeling some of the impacts of climate change. Warming permafrost bas led to structural damage of homes and other buildings in parts of Alaska and retreating sea ice bas spurred coastal erosion. University of Alaska scientists are intensively studying these phenomena, and can provide data sets related to vegetation change, permafrost thaw, methane emissions, and chlorophyll production in northern oceans, sea ice dynamics, insect outbreaks, and models that forecast changes in climate and weather patterns, among others. Although many of these changes are being felt most intensely in the Arctic, they are occurring globally and are of broad interest to people across the United States and around the world. We will illustrate our changing Earth by displaying dynamic animations and a 7-minute movie about climate change in the Arctic on spherical display systems (e.g. .. Magic Planet) in our respective outreach institutions in . Using a portable Magic Planet, we will also present our exhibits and related programming to underserved communities in rural Alaska, including some Alaska Native villages already experiencing the impacts of climate change. Our spherical displays will simulate the view of Earth from space and dramatically highlight the interconnectedness of the Arctic with other parts of the planet. We will highlight downstream effects of climate change, as well, including shifts in plant and animal ranges and animal migration patterns, which will be superimposed on the globe. Associated high-definition, flat screens will allow viewers to zoom in on regions of interest and will feature interviews with scientists, Alaska Natives and others who have personal experience with climate change in their lifetimes. We will also include footage of fieldwork recently conducted in the Arctic. The project will extend its reach across the nation through dissemination of our programs throughout the informal science education community, many of whom already use the Magic Planet as an educational platform. Our proposal will clearly advance NASA's mission, strategic vision and the specific objectives of NASA's Office of Education by l)using exciting, experiential, bands-on exhibits to boost public awareness of NASA's mission and programs; 2)expanding STEM informal education opportunities throughout Alaska and among Alaskan visitors, thereby promoting American scientific and technological literacy; and 3)reaching out to Alaska Native communities that have been underserved and underrepresented in education and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

WE WILL USE THE FLAT-PLATE ACCELERATOR AT THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER EXPERIMENTAL IMPACT LABORATORY TO INVESTIGATE HOW THESE SUGARS REACT UNDER THE EXTREME PRESSURES AND TEMPERATURES OF SIMULATED TERRESTRIAL IMPACT EVENTS. SHOCKED SOLUTIONS WILL BE ANALYZED BY LC/MS, GC/MS, NMR, AND MALDI-TOFMS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER AND IDENTITY OF THE SPECIES IN THE MIXTURES AND THEN COMPARED TO ANALYSES OF UNREACTED MIXTURES. IT IS LIKELY THAT UNDER THE EXTREME CONDITIONS OF THE SIMULATED IMPACT EVENTS THE SUGARS IN SOLUTION WILL FORM MORE COMPLEX MOLECULES, SUCH AS THREOSE (FORMED FROM THE DIMERIZATION OF GLYCOLALDEHYDE) OR FRUCTOSE (FORMED FROM THE DIMERIZATION OF DIHYDROXYACETONE). THIS OUTCOME WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT TO UNDERSTANDING THE DELIVERY AND SUBSEQUENT SHOCK CHEMISTRY OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOMOLECULES BECAUSE IT WOULD SHOW THAT THESE MOLECULES COULD SURVIVE IMPACT EVENTS TO FORM MORE COMPLEX MOLECULES.",,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this tool is to enable researchers to evaluate novel human-automation systems early in the design process. The tool will leverage the Man-Machine Integration Design and Analysis System (MIDAS, developed for NASA Ames), and provide the MIDAS-FAST (Function Allocation Simulation Tool). In this project, the team will develop a research-based module of human-automation interaction. The team will develop human performance models of scenarios of interest. These models will be based on task analyses performed in cooperation with subject matter experts (SMEs). Various validation studies will be performed throughout this project. The team will validate the task analyses by talk-through sessions with SMEs. Human performance model and human-automation interaction module predictions will be validated in empirical, human-in-the-Ioop studies. Results of the validations will be used to refine the models. One particular focus of the project is on developing a prototype tool that is both usable and useful for researchers, allowing them to easily modify scenarios and evaluate different potential automation conditions. This tool will provide for data entry screens that guide the user through the process of building a scenario. It will allow the researchers to specify numerous relevant factors, e.g., operators, tasks, environmental conditions, and function allocation strategy. It will offer a visualization capability that provides a virtual video of the scenario, showing operators interacting with equipment and each other. The output of the model run will include, in addition to the video file, parameters of interest such as situation awareness, workload, time to initiate tasks, time to complete tasks, and task accuracy.",,,,,,,,,

THE TOOL WILL ENABLE ANALYSTS TO IDENTIFY, EARLY IN THE DESIGN PROCESS, POTENTIAL DESIGN, TASK ALLOCATION, OR MISSION PLANNING ISSUES THAT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT ASTRONAUT PERFORMANCE. THE PROPOSED TOOL, SPACEPRINT, WILL LEVERAGE A HUMAN PERFORMANCE MODELING ENVIRONMENT, THE IMPROVED PERFORMANCE RESEARCH INTEGRATION TOOL (IMPRINT), AND TAILOR IT TO SPACE MISSION APPLICATIONS. IMPRINT WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE ARMY RESEARCH LABORATORY, AND IS AVAILABLE, FREE OF CHARGE, TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. IMPRINT INCLUDES ALGORITHMS TO STUDY PERFORMANCE SHAPING FACTORS SUCH AS FATIGUE, TRAINING, AND USE OF PROTECTIVE CLOTHING WITH HUMAN PERFORMANCE MODELS THAT INCLUDE WORKLOAD. SPACEPRINT WILL BE BASED ON AN EXTENSIVE LITERATURE REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS, IN WHICH THE TEAM SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATES HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP RESEARCH AND LESSONS LEARNED TO IDENTIFY AND QUANTIFY FACTORS IN LONG-TERM SPACE MISSIONS THAT AFFECT ASTRONAUT WORKLOAD, FATIGUE, AND PERFORMANCE. THE RESULT OF THIS META-ANALYSIS WILL BE USED TO UPDATE IMPRINT ALGORITHMS SO THEY MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT SPACE-SPECIFIC CONDITIONS. THE TOOL WILL BE DEVELOPED SO IT CAN BE RUN IN A PREDICTIVE MODE, TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE IN MISSIONS THAT ARE BEING PLANNED, AND SO IT CAN RUN IN A LIVE MODE, USING REAL-TIME ASTRONAUT INPUTS ON WORKLOAD, FATIGUE, AND WELLNESS. THE LIVE MODE WILL ALLOW PLANNERS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AS MISSIONS ARE BEING PERFORMED, AND EVALUATE POTENTIAL MITIGATION STRATEGIES. THE TEAM WILL IDENTIFY SCENARIOS OF INTEREST, PERFORM TASK ANALYSES WITH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS (SMES), AND DEVELOP MODELS TO REFLECT THOSE SITUATIONS. SMES WILL REVIEW THE MODELS AND THEIR PREDICTIONS AN EARLY VALIDATION STUDY. THE TEAM WILL ALSO PERFORM AN EMPIRICAL, HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP VALIDATION STUDY. RESULTS OF THE VALIDATIONS WILL BE USED TO REFINE THE MODELS. OUR SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH EFFORTS WILL FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON SITUATIONS THAT RESULT IN WORKLOAD TRANSITIONS (E.G., AUTOMATION FAILURES, OTHER OFF-NOMINAL EVENTS), PLACING THE ASTRONAUTS IN POTENTIAL OVERLOAD SITUATIONS. THESE CONDITIONS, WHEN ADDRESSED BY FATIGUED ASTRONAUTS, CONSTITUTE WORST CASE SCENARIOS AND REQUIRE SPECIFIC, IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION. ONE PARTICULAR GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A PROTOTYPE TOOL THAT IS BOTH USABLE AND USEFUL FOR ANALYSTS, ALLOWING THEM TO EASILY MODIFY SCENARIOS AND EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT FACTORS ON MISSION PERFORMANCE. THIS TOOL WILL PROVIDE DATA ENTRY SCREENS THAT GUIDE THE USER THROUGH THE PROCESS OF BUILDING A SCENARIO. IT WILL ALLOW THE RESEARCHERS TO SPECIFY NUMEROUS RELEVANT FACTORS, E.G., OPERATORS, TASKS, EQUIPMENT, ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, AND SLEEP SCHEDULES. THE OUTPUT OF THE MODEL RUN WILL INCLUDE PARAMETERS OF INTEREST SUCH AS PERCEIVED WORKLOAD, FATIGUE, TIME TO INITIATE TASKS, TIME TO COMPLETE TASKS, TASK ACCURACY, TASK FAILURES (REPRESENTING HUMAN ERROR), RESULTS OF TASK FAILURES, AND OVERALL MISSION SUCCESS.",,,,,,,,,

The recruitment of a high level of talent and the need for increased diversity of students entering the NASA pipeline has fostered a request by NASA sites for more summer interns with disabilities.

Co-eval clusters of stars with a range of masses are particularly useful for stellar modeling and evolution studies. They contain main sequence stars at higher masses enabling the study of these objects; they are chemically more homogeneous than field stars; and they allow one to test models of pre main-sequence and early stellar evolution without the complications inherent in modeling evolved objects of unknown age. The Trapezium itself is astrophysically interesting as it represents a very young population (few Myr) with some 0 and B members remaining, and several hundred variables having a range of masses and luminosities are already known to exist. We propose to perform photometry of stars in the Trapezium region of the Orion nebula. Our aims are to (1) update periods and quantify the aperiodic and quasiperiodic behavior of all stars in the field and (2) determine the types of variability for suspected or previously undetected variables with an eye toward the detection of pulsating variables; follow-up of known variables (e.g. Eaton, Herbst, and Hillenbrand 1995; AJ 110, 1735). We plan to search for variability in all stars with useful light curves. We will understake a comprehensive study of all variable objects in the field to provide the community with a modern survey of variability in the Trapezium, and giving us a potential new set of objects to help us understand these young stars. This cluster contains variables of several different types including T Tauri stars rotating spotted stars, and eclipsing binaries; it is possible that some of these stars may also have detectable pulsations. A study of all of these classes of variable will provide insight into the nature of these stars, and of young stars in general.",,,,,,,,,

The program has actually been supported by NASA since 1980 in an initial grant and series of single year grant supplements. The program is advertised by the American Astronomical Society as the AAS Small Research Grants Program. A web page is available with details on how to apply and file final reports at http:Uwww.aas.org/grants/smrg.php. Twice each year, proposals are received and reviewed (the review used to take place at AAS meetings; it is now done by teleconference with materials distributed electronically to broaden the potential referee pool and economize). The goal of the program is to take some administrative burden from NASA for small, unsolicited proposals while generating the maximum scientific return. The proposals may cover the support of travel to observatories, computer costs, page charges, and other purposes related to individual research projects. The proposals are peer reviewed by an AAS committee and the AAS administers the award to the individual scientists. In past years, the AAS solicited proposals from individual astronomers for support of research ranging in amount from $300 to $5,000; in 1998 the average value of the 19 grants was just over $3,500. Subsequent years have similar averages. Although we received permission in 2000 to increase the maximum award to $7,000 from our program officer, we opted to wait until we received the 2004 grant before implementing this change. This cap now adequately meets the needs of all reasonable proposals and we plan to keep this cap in place for the duration of this grant. The program has been tremendously successful, with numerous papers published from results obtained with program funding. Additionally, the program funds research travel, research equipment costs (such as computers) and also supports innovative requests involving public outreach or community support (such as the production of the American Association of Variable Star Observers finder chart CDROM). More detailed information on the amount of grants awarded and some program highlights under the program from 2004 to 2008 are given below. Astronomers don''t just find employment at major universities or research institutions. They work at smaller colleges, in the private sector and even at community colleges. In this environment it is difficult to maintain a research presence, so necessary in all realms of physical science. One prerequisite for excellence in teaching-at all levels-is active participation in research. This experience enables the astronomer to contribute to and maintain current knowledge about the field. Many smaller or less-endowed schools do not have the means, ability or tradition for supporting faculty research. The American Astronomical Society has always and will continue to actively support research experience for all its members. In an era of constrained research support it is lmportant to foster a wide variety of research projects. Funding agencies are inundated with requests to sponsor all manner of projects, large and small. The large projects are the most economically feasible to process and manage by government agencies. Unfortunately, only limited resources are usually available for small grants, of a few thousand dollars and many government proposal review processes mix very small grants in with normal and large requests, disadvantaging the small requestors. Despite their small size, grants of this amount have a remarkable potential to produce excellent science, especially for those researchers at smaller institutions or who are just starting out. These requests often represent the work of the astronomer in a small facility or those in a larger institution who need a lower level of support. It is important to reach these scientists, who represent an important segment of the American astronomical community. The succ  ",,,,,,,,,

Rather than being an extension ofthe school day, these programs provide a safe place for students to develop skills and explore topics not covered in typical school curricula. There is significant interest from government agencies and community stakeholders in establishing and sustaining afterschool programming around the country. Increasing attention is being paid to teaching science in afterschool programs, as under-privileged students who do not always have exposure or access to high-quality engagement in science often attend them. Such programs are a good vehicle to reach people who rarely participate in NASA education programs. Afterschool providers are looking for quality programming that has been designed for their unique setting, but there is an unfortunate deficiency in science content designed for out-of-school time. There is thus a tremendous opportunity for teaching astronomy in the afterschool setting, and most students and program leaders alike have an innate fascination with the cosmos. Afterschool Universe is a fun, hands-on afterschool astronomy program that introduces participants to a variety of basic concepts in astronomy. It is designed for middle school students, as research shows that middle school is a critical time in the development of attitudes about science and career options, especially in girls. This program was developed by the Astrophysics Science Division at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in 2006 and was pilot tested in 2006 and 2007. It has been disseminated nationally since early 2008 through two-day training workshops for program implementers. Over 300 afterschool program providers have been trained at these workshops, but the frequency and geographical reach of these trainings inherently limit the spread of the program. We propose to increase the efficacy and impact of the Afterschool Universe dissemination effort through a train-the-trainer method that taps into established organizations and networks that support afterschool programming. We will conduct an intensive three-day training workshop for selected staff from these organizations, then support attendees to conduct their own training workshops within their networks. This train-the-trainer method will permit a much more rapid dissemination of the program and provide a larger geographical reach than is currently possible. By training a small group of trainers, we can reach hundreds of implementers and thousands of students who would not otherwise learn much about astronomy. This is a fitting effort to build upon the excitement of the International Year of Astronomy in 2009, as it will provide both leader and student participants with continued exploration ofthe universe in the years that follow.",,,,,,,,,

In particular, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, which is widely used to guide conservation policy and spending, does not explicitly incorporate climate change into its criteria to evaluate extinction risk. We aim to address this shortcoming by developing a modeling framework that links remote sensing of the environment with in situ biological data sets and global climate model predictions. We will couple habitat suitability models (including the Maximum Entropy method, Maxent) with metapopulation simulations (implemented in RAMAS software). These models will link remote sensing products (e.g., land cover classifications, NDVI, EVI, LAI, GPP, NPP, fPAR) with biodiversity data from natural history collections and biodiversity surveys, and future climate scenarios generated for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Our linked modeling approach will enable extinction risks under climate change to be assessed based on both landscape and demographic properties, therefore providing more reliable assessments, subject to fewer uncertainties, than when applying habitat suitability models alone. The principal objectives of the proposed project are to: 1) test the use of remote sensing products alongside in situ biological data and climate data for building habitat suitability models; 2) link habitat suitability models and metapopulation simulations to assess extinction risk under climate change; 3) investigate the impact that including versus excluding remotely sensed data has on assessments of extinction risk; 4) develop guidelines to ensure that remote sensing products are fully integrated into ongoing efforts to incorporate climate change within the IUCN Red List criteria. We will test our approach using the herpetofaunas of the United States (where in situ datasets are relatively abundant) and Madagascar (where data is much more limited) as case studies. Through collaboration with the IUCN, we will produce guidelines and software tools to advance the use of remote sensing products in environmental forecasting that influences policy and resource management. Our project will therefore expand and accelerate the realization of societal benefits from Earth system science.",,,,,,,,,

The model is designed for cventual scale-up and/or replication at other informal science institutions and universities with high school mentoring components. The NASA Science Research Mentoring Program (SRMP) will constitute the career apprenticeship component of a newly dcsigncd K#tilde#16 AMNH scicnce pipeline. SRMP will contribute to NASA's educational mission by providing intensivc training in the Earth and space science contcnt areas emphasizcd by the Science Mission Directorate (SMD), as well as the mentoring, college prep and other supportive tools so esscntial to preparing studcnts for eventual carecrs in the sciences to fulfill NASA's and the rest of the Nation's sciencc workforce needs. The project will pair AMNH educators with AMNH science staff to teach underserved students from New York City. The program will feature five in-dcpth electives, offered twice per year (for a total of 250 slots), including introductory astrophysics, astrophysics research methodologies, the search for habitable planets, stellar evolution, and Earth science and climate change, intcgrating the SMD's Scicnce Questions"" and ""Research Questions"" for Earth Science, Planetary Science, and Astrophysics, such that any student pursing these courses would be exposed to the latest research addressing these questions. Since the courses will be co-taught by the mentors themselves, they will also teach the essential computational skills, technology and other tools necessary to participate in the scientists'' own research projects. Students will participate in the program for 2 years: they will pursue these preparatory courses during the 10th or 11th grade, and their second year, 18 of those who have successfully completed four of the five electivcs will be selected to conduct research in pairs with the Museum scientists who taught and designcd the electives. Students will also attend a hi-weekly research methods course. The Museum will partner with the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies'' New York City Research Initiative (NASA GISS-NYCRI), as well as with the NY STEM Institute, NASA's Center for Optical Sensing and Imaging (COSI) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Cooperative Remote Sensing Science and Technology Center (CREST), three research centers of City College New York (CCNY) that share with NASA the Museum's commitment to encouraging and preparing underrepresented youth to pursue carecrs in the sciences. Through the NY STEM Institute, SRMP participants can take 6-wcek summer courses in AP-Ievel math, chemistry and physics. SRMP students will also be eligible for one of GISS-NYCRJ's, COSI's and CREST's 50 additional summer mentorship slots. [n addition, SRMP students will participate in campus tours, lectures, workshops and other opportunities for program participants to familiarize themselves with the science teaching and research conducted on a university campus. [n sum, over the three-year grant period, AMNH will offer 750 slots in its Earth and Planetary Science electives and 54 on-site mentorship placements, in addition to the hundreds of additional summer offerings of our institutional partners.""",,,,,,,,,

The program will target secondary school teachers both nationally and in the greater New York City region, with a strong connection to the classroom use of NASA data and other resources. Program activities and products will include:*A semester-equivalent, online graduate course on the science of climate change for a national audience of secondary school teachers;*A teacher institute on climate change, comprised of both online and AMNH-based elements, for secondary school teachers in the NYC metropolitan region; and  *Online content resources about climate change for educators that will be made available to the ESSEA national network of higher education partners for use in undergraduate and graduate teacher education and professional development programs. The goal of the project is to connect the expertise of NASA GISS climate science researchers to educators in a broad range of settings via newly developed professional development offerings from the AMNH--in order to enhance educators'' content knowledge and thus to improve student learning on the science of climate change. The proposed work will draw upon the AMNH's leadership and experience in the creation of innovative, rigorous science professional development experiences in online, face-to-face, and blended formats. In particular, the project will utilize the strength of Seminars on Science, AMNH's award-winning online science professional development program, and its twin pillars of support--the Gottesman Center for Science Teaching and Learning, and the National Center for Science Literacy, Education, and Technology, both of which support the creation of networked learning experiences for teachers, students, and the general public. Project activities will be evaluated for impact and effectiveness, revised in response to that feedback, and subjected to summative evaluation to document impact. All programs are embedded in the scalable and sustainable framework of online and blended professional development at the Museum and are expected to continue long after the completion of the funding period. The target audience for the proposed online course will be secondary school science teachers across the nation, while the project's Teacher Institutes will have substantial impact in the ethnically and economically diverse NYC public schools. As the resources developed for the online course will also reach a large number of additional secondary school teachers through ESSEA and its 43 partners, it is estimated that the project will impact hundreds of educators and tens of thousands of students during the project period, with comparable numbers expected beyond that period. The proposed program is directly relevant to two of the goals articulated for the NASA's GCCE project: It will improve teaching and learning about global climate change in secondary schools and, by utilizing data-rich digital media resources produced by GISS researchers as well as requiring the creation of a curriculum unit utilizing My NASA Data, it will increase the number of students using NASA Earth Observation data/NASA Earth system models to investigate and analyze global climate change issues. In addition, the project is strongly aligned with NASA's three major education goals to engage Americans in NAS",,,,,,,,,

NRM enables the highest angular resolution science possible given the telescope's diameter and operating wavelength. It also provides precise information on a telescope's optical state. NRM relies on its high quality self-calibration properties and the robustness of interferometric techniques, whereas coronagraphy requires exquisite wavefront quality. Stability during an observation sets fundamental NRM contrast limits. A non-redundant mask was recently added to JWST's Fine Guidance Sensor Tunable Filter Imager (FGS TFJ) instrument, bringing a no-cost, no impact boost in angular resolution that complements JWST's coronagraphs. The JWST NR.1 search space lies between SO and 400 mas at 3.8 to 5 microns, even in the telescope's image quality does not meet requirements. JWST's NRM will produce 10 magnitudes of contrast in a 10 ks exposure on an M=7 star, placing Taurus protoplanets and nearby Jovians younger than 300 Myr within JWST's reach. Future space telescopes can improve vastly on JWST's NRt l by utilizing more refined observing methods, and instrumentation designed to take full advantage of NRM's high dynamic range, high contrast capabilities. The ATLAST 16 m segmented primary design can deliver to 12 magnitudes of contrast between 0.7 to 6 mas at 0.1 microns. On an 8 m telescope at O.t micron NRM resolution is almost ten times better than ALMA's finest resolution. Polarization with space-based NRM opens new vistas of astrophysics in planetary system and star formation as well as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and structure around Galactic Black Hole Candidates, with miUiarsecond resolution at 10 or more magnitudes of photometric dynamic range. Space NRM explores areas inaccessible to both JWST coronagraphs and future 30-m class ground-based telescopes. Ground-based NRM is limited by atmospheric variability. Optimization of space-based NRM requires consideration of flat fielding accuracy, target placement repeatability, charge diffusion, intrapixel sensitivity, image persistence, charge transfer efficiency, guilding, wavefront stability, and pupil wander. We propose to assess NRM limits realistically to understand the science yield and technological utility of NRM in space, and, simultaneously, develop NRM science for planet and star formation and extragalactic science in the UV -NIR, to help steer high resolution space based astronomy in the coming decade.",,,,,,,,,

Sub-micron mineral dust, still present in the fine-grained matrix of meteorites, coagulated and melted to form macroscopic clasts: once-molten Mg-silicate chondrules; the oldest solar system rocks, Ca-, Al-rich inclusions (CAIs); amoeboid-olivine-aggregates (AOAs). Different meteorite types (i.e., parent bodies) contain distinct abundances and sizes of chondrules and CAIs and their chemical and textural subtypes. We request support to measure the abundances, sizes, chemical compositions, and detailed crystallization histories of the objects (chondrules, CAIs, AOAs) that accreted together to form the most primitive meteorites. We will use this information in collaboration with astrophysical modelers to understand how these objects may have been formed and sorted into the different meteorite classes, and how that process bears on planet formation. Using previous support, we developed new techniques of 3D imaging, x-ray mapping and image analysis. We showed that existing abundance and size data collected long ago are not correct. We will address these questions with our measurements: What were the temperature, pressure, and volatile element distributions, local mixing and transport dynamics, and accretion chronologies during chondrite formation? Were high-temperature objects formed near the sun and transported outward? How did they mix in just the right proportions to yield different meteorite types, all with very similar overall chemical compositions? We also propose to use serial thin sectioning with a 30 micron wire saw to allow us to explore in unprecedented detail the crystallization histories and chemical, isotopic evolution during cooling of the oldest objects formed in the solar system: CAIs and AOAs. We will apply similar techniques, and 3D imaging, to find and explore layered chondrules that show evidence of repeated heating events in space before accretion. We will then apply state-of-the-art thermodynamic models to the chemical and isotopic data, in modeling how these objects formed in space. Finally, we will apply the same modeling tools to understanding the conditions of formation of minerals discovered in comet samples returned by the Stardust mission. These studies, together, bear directly on outstanding problems in cosmochemistry, at the interfaces between astrophysical theories, observations of far-away disks, and study of samples here on Earth.",,,,,,,,,

Our members were a primary subset of the team that recently developed a flight version of HOMER. This team won a Goddard 2007 Applied Engineering Technology Division, Science and Technology Advancement Award. The team was headed by D. Barry Coyle, our Goddard colleague [4]. We have also developed a two-head, 100 mJ laser, which has also been frequency stabilized to within 5 MHz over 30 minutes. This laser is the engine"" for a high energy laser to be used in Doppler wind measurements at Goddard. More recently, we have added fiber laser technology to our research efforts. A seeded fiber amplifier has been designed, bread-boarded, and made operational. This proposal outlines the course of research we wish to pursue over the next 3 years working with Dr. Coyle.

THE PRIMARY ACCOMPLISHMENTS FROM THE PHASE II EFFORT WOULD BE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ULTRA LOW NOISE (LOW JITTER), HIGH DETECTION EFFICIENCY, VERY HIGH GAIN AND HIGH SPEED NEAR-INFRARED PHOTODETECTORS AND ARRAYS SENSITIVE IN THE 1000 NM TO1600 NM SPECTRAL REGION. THE TECHNOLOGY OF INTERNAL DISCRETE AMPLIFICATION ENABLES THE COMBINATION OF HIGH SPEED, VERY HIGH GAIN AND ULTRA LOW NOISE BECAUSE THE INTERNAL DISCRETE AMPLIFICATION NULLIFIES THE EFFECT OF IMPACT IONIZATION COEFFICIENTS AND PREVENTS THE EDGE BREAK DOWN, WITH HIGH DETECTION EFFICIENCY AND HIGH SPEED OF OPERATION. THESE PHOTODETECTORS MIGHT ALSO BE USED IN MISSILE SEEKERS, BATTLEFIELD TARGET IDENTIFICATION AND RECOGNITION SYSTEMS, AND EYE-SAFE LADAR.

WHAT THIS WORK SEEKS TO ACCOMPLISH IS AN EXTENSION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY TO THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT DEFINE  NASA S SPACE MISSION AND WHICH TO DATE HAVE NOT BEEN SATISFIED, E.G. OPERATIONAL RANGES OF -200C TO 300C.  UNDER THIS EFFORT, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL LEVERAGE THEIR PAST ADVANCES IN SNW TECHNOLOGY, WHICH HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO PROVIDE HIGH ENERGY CAPACITIES AND GOOD CYCLING CHARACTERISTICS, WHILE FOCUSING THEIR PRESENT EFFORTS ON DEVELOPING A BATTERY CELL CAPABLE OF WITHSTANDING THE ENVIRONMENTAL EXTREMES THAT NASA REQUIRES, AND VIA TESTING, DEMONSTRATE A FINAL TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVEL (TRL) 5 FOR THE COMPONENT TECHNOLOGIES. IN AGGREGATE, THIS EFFORT IS COMPRISED OF FOUR MAIN TASKS.   TASK 1 REQUIRES THE CONTRACTOR TO EVALUATE BATTERY ELECTROLYTES FOR POSSIBLE USE WITH SNW ANODES UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT LOW TEMPERATURE OPERATION AND MULTIPLE CYCLES ARE REQUIRED.  IN TASK 2, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL DEVELOP FULL CELL BATTERIES BASED UPON SNW ANODES, NCA CATHODES, AND AN ELECTROLYTE DETERMINED THROUGH COMPONENT TESTING CONDUCTED IN TASK 1.  THESE CELLS SHALL BE DELIVERED TO BOTH THE NASA JET PROPULSION LABORATORY (JPL) AND NASA GLENN RESEARCH CENTER (GRC) FOR INDEPENDENT TESTING.  UNDER TASK 3, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL DEVELOP A SECOND SET OF FULL CELL BATTERIES BASED ON A SNW ANODE, NICKEL, MANGANESE, COBALT (NMC) CATHODE, AND AN OPTIMIZED ELECTROLYTE.  THESE CELLS SHALL ALSO BE DELIVERED TO BOTH THE JPL AND GRC FOR INDEPENDENT TESTING.  FINALLY, IN TASK 4 THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE A WHITE PAPER THAT OUTLINES POTENTIAL FUTURE RESEARCH ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPTIMIZATION OF SNW ANODES FOR LOW TEMPERATURE OPERATION BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO TASKS 1, 2 AND 3.",,,,,,,,,

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF RECENT MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION AND GEODETIC ACCURACY OF LUNAR TOPOGRAPHIC DATA AS A BASIS FOR CALCULATIONS TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE SELENOLOCATION OF THE M3 DATA. ROOT-MEAN-SQUARED (RMS) POSITIONAL ERRORS WILL BE REDUCED FROM #tilde#200 M RELATIVE AND 450 M ABSOLUTE TO ON THE ORDER OF A PIXEL (140 M) OR BETTER, AND THE NUMEROUS IMAGES WITH GROSS POSITIONAL ERRORS OF KILOMETERS WILL BE CORRECTED. SECONDARILY, SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC ACCURACY WILL BE IMPROVED THROUGH THE USE OF A MUCH MORE DETAILED TOPOGRAPHIC MODEL IN PHOTOMETRIC CORRECTIONS AND MORE ACCURATE REGISTRATION TO THIS MODEL. TWO DATASETS WILL BE USED: (1) DIGITAL DATA FROM THE M3 PDS ARCHIVE, INCLUDING HYPERSPECTRAL DATA FROM TWO MAJOR OPTICAL IMAGING PERIODS, ANCILLARY DATA INCLUDING SPICE KERNELS, SELENOLOCATION FILES, AND ENGINEERING DATA SUFFICIENT TO REPRODUCE AND IMPROVE UPON EARLIER RAY-TRACING RESULTS (BOARDMAN ET AL., 2011; GREEN ET AL., 2011); AND (2) THE FULL-RESOLUTION (#tilde#100 M/PIXEL) DIGITAL TERRAIN MODEL (DTM) DERIVED FROM STEREO IMAGING OF THE WIDE ANGLE CAMERA (WAC) INSTRUMENT ON THE LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (E.G., SCHOLTEN ET AL., 2011). THE WORK CONSISTS OF FIVE MAJOR TASKS: (1) SYSTEMATIC REPROCESSING OF THE FULL DATASET THROUGH THE MISSION-DEVELOPED LEVEL 1B PROCESSING PIPELINE USING THE WAC DTM TO GREATLY IMPROVE SELENOLOCATION ACCURACY; (2) DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE TOOLS FOR PROCESSING M3 DATA ''MOST IMPORTANTLY, A PHYSICALLY RIGOROUS CAMERA MODEL'' IN THE USGS ISIS3; (3) USE OF THE ADVANCED CAPABILITIES OF ISIS TO CONTROL THE GLOBAL M3 DATASET WITH IMPROVED ACCURACY AND GENERATE FURTHER IMPROVED LEVEL 1B PRODUCTS; (4) SYSTEMATIC REPROCESSING OF BEST VERSION OF LEVEL 1B DATA THROUGH THE MISSION DEVELOPED LEVEL 2 PROCESSING PIPELINE USING THE WAC DTM TO GREATLY IMPROVE PHOTOMETRIC ACCURACY; (5) GENERATION OF A COMPLETE SET OF ORTHORECTIFIED AND MOSAICKED (LEVEL 3) DATA PRODUCTS INCLUDING PHOTOMETRICALLY NORMALIZED SPECTRA AND SPECTRAL PARAMETER MAPS; AND (6) DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS, WITH INTERIM RESULTS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE ONLINE AND FINAL SPICE KERNELS, LEVEL 1B AND LEVEL 3 PRODUCTS FORMALLY ARCHIVED TO THE IMAGING NODE OF THE PLANETARY DATA SYSTEM (PDS). THE MULTIPLE PRODUCTS GENERATED BY THIS EFFORT WILL SERVE THE BROADEST POSSIBLE SET OF SCIENTIFIC APPLICATIONS OF THE M3 DATASET. LEVEL 1B PRODUCTS, WHICH ARE NOT SPATIALLY RESAMPLED, ARE ESSENTIAL OR STUDIES REQUIRING THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE SPECTRAL FIDELITY, AND THE IMPROVED SELENOLOCATION ACCURACY OF OUR RESULTS WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PHOTOMETRIC NORMALIZATION OF THESE DATA AND FACILITATE COMPARISON WITH OTHER DATASETS. THE RESAMPLED LEVEL 3 PRODUCTS WILL GREATLY SIMPLIFY THE USE OF M3 FOR REGIONAL STUDIES IN WHICH SUMMARY SPECTRAL CHARACTERISTICS SUFFICE. FINALLY, THE COMBINATION OF A FULL SET OF ISIS TOOLS PLUS IMPROVED SPICE DATA WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR USERS WHOSE SPECIAL NEEDS ARE NOT MET BY EITHER OF THESE PRODUCT SETS TO DO THEIR OWN M3 PROCESSING.",,,,,,,,,

This course will use a computer-modeling approach to understanding the basic physics involved in rocket design and deployment. The syllabus will be based on components of a course that was developed for high school students as part of the ESMD-funded NASA's BEST Students"" project. The high school course was pilot tested as a two-week summer bridge course in the summer of 2009 and will be refined during the 2009 fall semester. The proposed professional development for STEM educators would be designed to be delivered as a hybrid course, with face-to-face sessions to begin and end the class, and an online component in between. During the pilot phase, we plan to collect and edit video footage to be made available to the NASA community at large as a resource for teaching systems thinking. We propose to collaborate with the Rocket Workshop for Teachers also being proposed by Goddard Education, and bring our educators to Wallops Flight Facility for a field trip during the Rocket Workshop for Teachers, during which they will be introduced to various model rockets and share experiences with the Rocket Workshop group of educators.""",,,,,,,,,

However, the importance of intraspecific genetic diversity to ecosystem functioning is poorly understood. Recent work demonstrates that genetic diversity within a foundation forest species, Populus tremuloides, can have large influences on ecological processes, especially carbon and nitrogen cycling. We propose to use remote sensing to measure the genetic diversity of P. tremuloides forests across multiple ecoregions. Our goal is to combine remotely sensed data with ground-truthed genetic and soil microbial data to better understand the patterns and consequences of forest genetic diversity across natural landscapes. Trembling aspen (P. tremuloides) is a dominant, early successional species that plays major ecological and economic roles in forests throughout western and north-temperate North America. We will combine Landsat and hyperspectral data with genetic, chemical, and microbial data to build predictive models of fundamental ecological processes. Our overall goal is to quantify forest intraspecific genetic diversity, and associated belowground microbial diversity and function, using remotely sensed data. Declining biodiversity is among the most important environmental issues facing society. Despite decades of research, the large-scale patterns and consequences of forest genetic diversity are unknown. Our current knowledge gaps are due, in large part, to the technical difficulties inherent in sampling large spatial areas for fine-scale information (e.g., plant genotype). We propose to bridge this gap in trembling aspen forests, a dominant, ecologically and economically important ecosystem, using a combination of remotely-sensed and ground-truthed data.",,,,,,,,,

Many educated adults struggle to comprehend such basic relationships as that between Earth's seasonal changes and the tilt of the planet on its axis, or between the role of atmospheric carbon dioxide in developing tree mass and the effects of its odorless release when trees are burned. Despite recent films, television programs and publications about human impacts on the climate system, many people still inaccurately associate the problem of global warming with the hole in the ozone layer"" (NOAA, 2007). The urgency of the changing climate demands a greater understanding of our climate system, not only by the leaders of today, but by the scientists, policy makers, and citizens of tomorrow. In direct response to a need for greater scientific literacy with respect to climate science, we propose to establish the Climate Action Network through Direct Observations and Outreach (CAN-DOO). NASA has led the charge in climate science through long-term observations and computer simulations of the global climate system as well as through their portfolio of education and outreach programs. CAN-DOO will complement the NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) education and public outreach portfolio by promoting public awareness of climate science and by introducing various levels of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) principles to homeschooled students, local public school students, and undergraduate students through hands-on, problem-based climate science activities. The specific objectives of CAN-DOO are as follows: 1. Develop the infrastructure for sustaining and expanding public outreach through long-term climate measurements capable of complementing existing NASA measurements. 2. Enhance public awareness of climate science and NASA's role in advancing our understanding of the Earth System. 3. Introduce STEM principles to homeschooled, public school, and students through applied climate science activities.  attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors annually. In partnership with , we will promote climate science awareness through Citizen Science activities, interactive public displays, and  staff training. These activities will allow the general public to become engaged in climate science by ""seeing"" how their regional climate is changing and what impact this may have on their everyday lives. In order to have a future workforce capable of  comprehending and addressing the changing climate, we must attract and retain students in STEM disciplines. The CAN-DOO project takes a novel approach to engaging students by involving them in the entire scientific investigative process as applied to climate science. Local elementary and middle school students, homeschooled students throughout , and undergraduate students in the new Global Climate Change course and select Chemistry, Geography, and Physics courses at  will, in varying degrees, be introduced to instrument assembly and calibration against NASA research grade instruments, data collection, and data analysis.

WE PROPOSE A NON-CONTACT OPTICAL INSTRUMENT SIMILAR TO CHEMCAM THAT WILL BE CAPABLE OF MEASURING NOT ONLY COMPLETE ELEMENTAL COMPOSITIONS BUT ALSO ISOTOPIC ABUNDANCES OF THE KEY ELEMENTS IN SURFACE MATERIALS. WE INTEND TO UTILIZE AND FURTHER DEVELOP OUR RECENTLY PUBLISHED TECHNOLOGY: LASER ABLATION MOLECULAR ISOTOPIC SPECTROMETRY (LAMIS). OUR CONCEPT IS SIMPLE, SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN AND ALREADY ENDORSED BY TWO INNOVATION AWARDS WE RECEIVED. IN PHASE I, WE CONCENTRATE ON DEMONSTRATING THE RESOLUTION AND SENSITIVITY REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THESE ISOTOPES IN SYNTHETIC SAMPLES AND NATURAL MINERALS RELEVANT TO MARS. THE IMMEDIATE FOCUS IS ON MARS BUT OUR CONCEPT IS ALSO HIGHLY GERMANE TO FUTURE LANDING MISSIONS TO THE MOON, OTHER PLANETS AND THEIR MOONS, ASTEROIDS, AND TO A BROAD RANGE OF APPLICATIONS IN ECOLOGY, AGRONOMY, NUCLEAR INDUSTRY, RADIO-CHEMOTHERAPY, FORENSICS, SECURITY AND OTHER FIELDS. WE WILL ADVANCE THE DEVELOPMENT TO TRL4 BY THE END OF PHASE II WITH THE FURTHER AIM OF INTEGRATING OUR LAMIS DETECTOR WITH A CHEMCAM-LIKE INSTRUMENT. THE PROPOSED INSTRUMENT LEVERAGES AND ADVANCES THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED FOR CHEMCAM. THE ADDED STRENGTH OF MEASURING ISOTOPES WILL GREATLY EXPAND THE CAPABILITIES OF THE CHEMCAM, WHICH IS NOW THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED INSTRUMENT ONBOARD \CURIOSITY.\"" IN PHASE II, WE WILL DEVELOP A BREADBOARD PROTOTYPE OF THE INSTRUMENT THAT CAN BE AMENDED TO MEASURE OTHER KEY ISOTOPES (B, CL, MG, CA, SR, ETC.).

ONE CRITICAL SUITE OF THESE CAPABILITIES WILL BE AIMED AT LEVERAGING ADVANCED SENSOR TECHNOLOGIES TO ALERT AND WARN PILOTS OF POTENTIAL AND IMPENDING SAFETY CONCERNS.  WHILE ALERTING SYSTEMS HAVE EXISTED IN AIRCRAFT COCKPITS SINCE THEIR INSTANTIATION, THE CHANGING ROLE OF THE PILOT WITHIN NEXTGEN IS EXPECTED TO FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE WAY THESE SYSTEMS WILL NEED TO OPERATE.  THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PILOT AND THE DENSITY OF AIR TRAFFIC WITHIN THE AIRSPACE ARE BOTH EXPECTED TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE WITHIN THE DEFINED CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS FOR NEXTGEN (JOINT PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT OFFICE [JPDO], 2007).  AS A RESULT, THE SHEER NUMBER OF POTENTIAL HAZARDS AND RELEVANT INFORMATION THAT MUST BE PERCEIVED AND PROCESSED BY THE PILOT WILL GROW EXPONENTIALLY.  THIS INFORMATION IS LIKELY TO COME FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES, REQUIRING THE PILOT TO INTEGRATE THIS INFORMATION IN ORDER TO EVALUATE HAZARD POTENTIAL.  EVALUATING HAZARD POTENTIAL WILL DEPEND ON A CONSIDERATION OF, AND DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN, IMMEDIATE (CURRENT) HAZARDS AND SITUATIONS REQUIRING RE-PLANNING OR COORDINATION (FUTURE).  TO SUPPORT THESE CHALLENGING RESPONSIBILITIES, THE PILOT HAS AN UNAMBIGUOUS NEED FOR AN INTEGRATED ALERTING AND NOTIFICATION (IAN) SYSTEM THAT WILL CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR MULTIPLE SOURCES OF INTERDEPENDENT INFORMATION TO EVALUATE HAZARD POTENTIALS, TRACK MULTIPLE POTENTIAL HAZARDS, PROVIDE CAUTION/WARNING/ALERTING (CWA) NOTIFICATIONS AND CONTEXT-RELEVANT DECISION SUPPORT TO THE PILOT, AND DETERMINE THE BEST METHOD OF PRESENTING THIS INFORMATION TO ENSURE THAT THE INFORMATION CAN BE VIEWED AND USED EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. THERE ARE TWO BROAD CHALLENGES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE AN IAN SYSTEM CAN BECOME OPERATIONAL.  FIRST, EXISTING METHODS CANNOT REASON ABOUT THE PROPOSED SCALE OF INFORMATION AND HAZARDS IN SUCH A TIME-CRITICAL ENVIRONMENT.  SPECIFICALLY, THESE METHODS DO NOT PROVIDE A ROBUST APPROACH FOR INTEGRATING (E.G., PROCTOR, 1998), INTERPRETING, AND PROVIDING RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAN BE GENERATED BY THE DIVERSE AND LARGE SET OF DATA EXPECTED WITHIN THE NEXTGEN CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS. SECOND, THE INTERACTION BETWEEN A HUMAN PILOT AND AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM IS COMPLEX (GALSTER, 2003; GALSTER & PARASURAMAN, 2003; PARASURAMAN & RILEY, 1997; PARASURAMAN, SHERIDAN, & WICKENS, 2000), AND THE DESIGN OF AN ADVANCED ALERTING TECHNOLOGY MUST LEVERAGE EMPIRICALLY PROVEN METHODS FOR ENSURING EFFECTIVE COLLABORATIVE PERFORMANCE OF THE HUMAN-SYSTEM TEAM (PRITCHETT, V NDOR, & EDWARDS, 2002).  FURTHERMORE, THE NEW METHODS OF PILOT-AUTOMATION INTERACTION WILL REQUIRE NOVEL METHODS OF VALIDATION TO ENSURE THAT IAN CAN EFFECTIVELY SUPPORT THE PILOT IN THE RANGE OF FLIGHT TASKS SPECIFIED WITHIN NEXTGEN.   OBJECTIVE(S):  THE CONTRACTOR WILL ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING TWO OBJECTIVES WHICH CENTER ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ALERTING AND REASONING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (ALARMS).  ALARMS WILL CONSIST OF A RIGOROUSLY-TESTED USER-CENTERED MODEL TO DRIVE CWA FUNCTIONS AND A DEDICATED DISPLAY TO PORTRAY THESE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE PILOT.    OBJECTIVE 1: 	ESTABLISH METHODS, MODELS AND METRICS REQUIRED FOR RIGOROUS DESIGN OF IAN FUNCTIONALITY, ABILITY TO ASSESS IMPACT ON SAFETY, AND ABILITY TO VERIFY AND VALIDATE TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE. OBJECTIVE 2: PROVIDE RIGOROUS GENERALIZABLE RESULTS AND METHODS TO CREATE AND ASSESS IAN FUNCTIONAL DESIGNS THAT BEST SUPPORT HUMAN PERFORMANCE.    SCOPE OF WORK: THE KEYS TO THE PROPOSED ALARMS EFFORT ARE: 1) THE CONTRACTOR WILL DEVELOP A SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM-USER MODEL THAT USES CONTEXT-",,,,,,,,,

THE PROPOSED TOOL WILL EXPLOIT MULTI-CORE CPUS AND THE THOUSANDS OF STREAM CORES IN THE LATEST GPUS, WHICH WERE MADE ACCESSIBLE TO PROGRAMMERS THROUGH SPECIALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KITS. THESE LARGE NUMBERS OF STREAM CORES IN GPUS, AND THE POSSIBILITY TO EXECUTE NON-GRAPHICS COMPUTATIONS ON THEM, OPEN UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF PARALLELISM AT A VERY LOW COST. IN THE LAST 8 YEARS, GPUS HAD AN INCREASING PERFORMANCE ADVANTAGE OF AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE RELATIVE TO X86 CPUS. FURTHERMORE, THIS PERFORMANCE ADVANTAGE WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN THE NEXT 20 YEARS BECAUSE OF THE SCALABILITY OF THE CHIP MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. THE TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES WILL BE TO EFFICIENTLY EXPLOIT THE GPU PARALLELISM IN ORDER TO ACCELERATE THE EXECUTION OF OUR PROTOTYPE GPU-BASED PARALLEL BDD PACKAGE, AND TO IMPLEMENT HYBRID APPROACHES COMBINING IT WITH OUR GPU-BASED PARALLEL SAT SOLVER. BDDS AND SAT SOLVERS ARE ORTHOGONAL METHODS WITH DIFFERENT ADVANTAGES, AND A HYBRID OF THE TWO WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE BOTH THE SPEED AND CAPACITY WHEN FORMALLY VERIFYING COMPLEX SOFTWARE FOR SPACE MISSIONS. WE ACHIEVED AT LEAST 2 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE SPEEDUP WITH OUR PROTOTYPE GPU-BASED PARALLEL BDD PACKAGE IN A PREVIOUS PHASE I, AND EXPECT TO ACHIEVE AT LEAST 4 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE SPEEDUP WITH OUR HYBRID BDD-SAT TOOL BY THE END OF PHASE II, COMPARED TO THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ART.",,,,,,,,,

The transit provides an excellent opportunity to inform the public of every SMD research area: the Sun; Venus as a planet; transit as an astronomical tool for extra solar planet detection; and Venus atmosphere as a runaway greenhouse for global warming.  This is a rare event that will have great public interest. Since the advent of telescopic astronomy in the early seventeenth century, there have been but six transits (in pairs) of the sun by Venus, those of 1631/1639, 1761/1769, and 1874/1882. The seventh occurred in 2004 with its pair in 2012. Sun EDGE will use the talents and expertise of two well established programs and award winning teams, NASA Sun##Earth Day, and NASA EDGE, to produce a ##last-in-a-lifetime## live webcast for the June 6th, 2012 Transit of Venus from Mauna Kea. We will work through an established partnership with the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy to provide the best spot in the world to view the Transit of Venus. The event will not be visible from the continental U.S. in its entirety and a mountainside Visitors Information Station near the observatories in Hilo, Hawaii will give a wonderful view of the transit with little chance of cloud cover to a worldwide audience. In addition to the live webcast, we will produce a new series of video podcasts or vodcasts that can be used in schools, museums and public outreach events to enhance science knowledge and understanding of the Sun, its mysterious history and terrestrial events. Central Objectives:  1.Provide an exemplary, highly-leveraged and cost-effective framework to enhance the proposed efforts to improve the effectiveness of heliophysics mission Education and Public Outreach (E/PO) and help them tell an integrated, science-driven story of exploration and discovery.  2.Drawing on the excitement and uniqueness of NASA, motivate, and educate students to pursue STEM careers by enhancing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education with heliophysics resources aligned to National Science Education Standards. 3.Inspire and inform the public in general with the dynamic science of the Sun and its profound influence on the Earth and space environments and the lives of all who live in them.Perceived Significance of the Proposed Work: Sun EDGE is fully aligned with the NASA Education Portfolio Strategic Framework. In particular to I) Strengthen NASA and the Nation##s future workforce, II) Attract and retain students in STEM disciplines, and III) Engage Americans in NASA##s mission Our programs target formal education audiences from pre-Kindergarten (pre-K) through Undergraduate (UG) with special emphasis on attracting and retaining underserved populations through targeted partnerships with minority and underserved groups, colleges, and professional societies. In addition, there is a strong career focus that allows children/students to access information on careers through podcasts/vodcasts, distance learning, live and recorded scientist interviews, as well as having authentic research opportunities. Methods/techniques to accomplish key objectives; The key components/objectives are: 1.Coordination of year-long activities around a given theme; 2.

The studies of meteorites show that solar system planetesimals formed at the orbital distances of today's asteroids experienced an aqueous phase of alteration, where organic material condensed from the nebula was further modified by chemical reactions. Understanding the extent of these processes may offer insights into how abiotic organic compounds, sometimes identical to biomolecules, formed and/or survived in planetary environments. This proposal is the outgrowth of work conducted in our laboratory that characterized L-enantiomeric excesses (ee) within a subgroup of meteoritic amino acids, which provide the only case of molecular asymmetry measured outside the Biosphere. To date, these ee seem limited to the chiral 2-methyl-2-amino acids, however, it is possible that they were also present in 2-H-2-amino acids but were lost to racemization during aqueous reactions. Because racemization, the reversal and equilibration between L- and D-configurations in water, affects especially amino acids having a hydrogen attached to the second carbon, the possibility would seem hard to prove. However, acids having two chiral centers instead of one may still be able to reveal prior ee for 2-H compounds in meteorites, in spite of water exposure and racemization. Their study, would offer unique opportunities to estimate the extent of molecular asymmetry in the solar nebula upon formation of meteorite parent bodies and the physico-chemical conditions of those planetesimal aqueous processes. We propose to perform chiral analyses of Murchison and Murray diasteromeric amino and monocarboxylic acids, which are known but were never analyzed for this purpose, employing methodologies we have used previously with success. The proposed studies seek an understanding of chemical processes in the early solar system that fostered the evolution of abiotic organic molecules and of the traits they share with biomolecules. As such, they are directly relevant to the objectives of this NRA.",,,,,,,,,

Much has been learned about meteoritic amino acids through extensive molecular, isotopic, and chiral analyses of the last thirty ye5ars. We know, for example, that they were formed ahiotically and that their syntheses involved several solar and pre-solar environments, with some showing high deuterium enrichments that relate them to the cold regimes of the interstellar medium. To date,  however, several gaps remain in our understanding of the specific syntheses that led to these compoundsi formation as well as of the significance their exogenous delivery might have had for the origin of terrestrial homochirality. Therefore, we propose to continue the studies conducted in this laboratory during previous grant years with the following analytical tasks. i To constrain the possible origin of meteoritic amino acids by conducting computer-aided ah initio calculation of selected amino acid species. i To probe further the possible effect of abiotic ee in molecular evolution and expand the prebiotic modeling of catalytic transfer of asymmetry from di-peptides to sugars to include the syntheses of compounds that are important to extant life such as ribose and glucose. The proposed work has shown much promise in preliminary studies and will expand greatly our understanding of the prebiotic traits in chemical evolution that could foster the establishment of biomolecule precursors.

Our goal is to determine if transient or low-level quantities of 02 were present in the environment before the Great Oxidation Event (G.O.E.). The presence or absence of 02 at this time has bearing on the relationship between the timing of the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis and the rise of atmospheric 02 i a relationship that will inform the eventual interpretation of spectra from extrasolar Earth-like planets. The proposed work builds directly on prior research on one of the two cores conducted by the PI, Co-I and others with support from the NASA Astrobiology program. In that study, summarized here, high-resolution chemostratigraphy revealed an episode of enrichment of the redox-sensitive transition metals Mo and Re in pyritic shales from the late Archean Mt. McRae Shale, Western Australia. Correlations with organic carbon and Re-Os data indicated these metals were derived from contemporaneous seawater. We proposed that Mo and Re were supplied to Archean oceans by oxidative weathering of crustal sulfide minerals and, hence, that small but significant amounts of 02 existed in the environment 50 Ma before the start of the G.O.E. We now propose to conduct similar analyses on a drill core that samples pyritic shales from the late Archean Klein Naute Formation, S. Africa, believed to be a time-correlative deposit with the Mt. McRae Shale. We also propose to conduct Fe, Mo, U and S isotope analyses and to characterize sedimentary Fe speciation in both cores. The proposed research will test key aspects of the 02 interpretation as well as alternative hypotheses, and will help determine if the event recorded in the Mt. McRae Shale was of local or global extent.",,,,,,,,,

Throughout history, surface environments were affected by volcanic resurfacing and degassing, tectonics, impacts, the atmospheric greenhouse effect, and gas escape. We propose to evaluate mineralogical, geochemical, and geological consequences of gas-solid type interactions in Venus'' history with theoretical physical-chemical methods. We will explore how global volcanism 0.5-1 Ga ago and corresponding greenhouse heating influenced pathways and rates of weathering of igneous and secondary minerals, thermal decomposition of H-bearing silicates and carbonates (if they were present), and degassing of volatiles from solids. Buffering of evolving atmospheric composition by gas-mineral equilibria will be explored. Special attention will be devoted to humid conditions on early Venus, which might have favored aqueous deposition of carbonates and other salts. We will explore local and/or temporal gas-mineral type alterations caused by strong impacts and volcanic eruptions. Current pathways of gas-solid interaction will be revaluated with use of advanced computer codes. The results will yield estimates of amounts of secondary and primary minerals as functions of the progress of gas-solid reactions in time, as well as oxidation state and concentrations of atmospheric gases.",,,,,,,,,

The three volcanoes of the Tharsis Montes on Mars, including Ascraeus Mons, have unusual fan-shaped deposits on their west-northwestern flanks, variously attributed to mass wasting, volcanism and glaciation. Recent studies have provided convincing evidence that the deposits originated from cold-based glaciers similar to those seen in the Antarctic Dry Valleys. This study will investigate the potential glacial origin of the Ascraeus Mons fan-shaped deposit, as a glacial origin could indicate present-day near-surface ice, making this site important in the search for resources in the Solar System. The morphology of the Ascraeus Mons deposit will be examined using high-resolution Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) images coupled with Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MaLA) data, as well as a review of the work done by Parsons and Head (2005). An initial review provided persuasive evidence for a cold-based glacier origin of the fan-shaped deposit. Following the methodology of Shean et al. (2005), a preliminary steady-state profile model for potential ice sheet thickness was developed based on the Nye (1952) method using Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MaLA) data. The preliminary modeled ice sheet was consistent with the observed regional morphology. A more robust thickness model including factors such as accumulation rate, surface temperature, and geothermal heat flux will be developed. A finite element model will then be developed to calculate temperature and velocity along the assumed ice sheet, in order to model flow rate of the ancient glacier. Preliminary results provide convincing evidence for a cold-based glacier origin hypothesis for the Ascraeus Mons fan-shaped deposit, making the region an important site for future studies of the martian climate. water distribution and the search for extraterrestrial life.""",,,,,,,,,

Although chemical enrichment has been coarsely simulated on cosmological scales - no one has captured the abundance inhomogeneities that arise in real stellar populations. Instead - studies on stellar scales have focused on star formation: targeting H2 and HD chemistry in primordial clusters and magnetohydrodynamic and radiative processes in present-day clusters. We will carry out numerical simulations that model in unparalleled detail the chemical changes that occur after stars form and enrich their surroundings. Our approach will start from the point of star formation and diligently model the subsequent production / dissemination / and accretion of 92 chemical elements: from H / He / and Li to tracers of the r and s-processes. Our efforts will focus on the ten-thousand to one million solar mass scales on which molecular clouds - the primary units of star-forming gas - are converted into open clusters - the primary units of formed stars. These clusters play a pivotal role in chemical evolution and are constrained by as wealth of observations: studies of metal-poor Galactic halo stars have found a number of unusual abundance trends - which provide important clues to the earliest epochs of enrichment; spectroscopic studies of nearby clusters have uncovered substantial inhomogeneities that result in a significant intracluster abundance scatter between stars; and self-enrichment is expected to strongly affect which stellar systems are most likely to host habitable planets. Quantifying these processes with our simulations will directly impact a wide range of future NASA missions including the James Webb Space Telescope / Kepler / and the New Worlds Observer as well as impact our interpretation of ongoing ground-based observations. Most importantly - our work will contribute to answering the more fundamental questions: what is the universe and from what is it made?,,,,,,,,,

The key to reading this record is to use the shock metamorphic effects to estimate the pressure and duration of shock events, which can be related back to velocity and size of the impacting bodies. The primary objective of this research is to understand the conditions and dynamics of shock metamorphism in meteorites from the mineralogy and microstructures of high-pressure minerals in and around shock-induced melt veins and use this information to explore the impact processes on meteorite parent bodies. We will use transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy to investigate the mineralogy, textures, and microstructures of high-pressure minerals in and associated with shock-melt veins in chondrites.

This issue is especially important given reports that the crew's immune system is dysfunctional during flight, and our recent discovery that spaceflight increased the disease-causing potential and globally altered the gene expression of the human food-borne pathogen Salmonella typhimurium. Our research also showed that many of the observed changes in Salmonella were, associated with specific proteins in the cells, called RNA binding proteins, that bind to and regulate genetic material within the cell to control cellular characteristics in response to stress. In addition, our studies during spaceflight and using ground-based, spaceflight analogue culture systems have shown that increasing the concentration of certain ionic salts, like phosphates, in the growth media can prevent the increased disease causing potential observed for Salmonella during spaceflight. Interestingly, human cells also contain evolutionarily conserved RNA binding proteins that are very similar in structure and function to those found in bacteria. In human cells, these RNA binding proteins are critical for the cells proper function, including supporting a healthy immune system, maintaining tissue differentiation, and responding to cellular stress. We hypothesize that RNA binding regulatory proteins and their small RNA binding counterparts are key to a conserved, common cellular spaceflight response mechanism in both bacterial and human cells and that this response can be manipulated by environmental salt/ion levels. The implications of a universally conserved molecular response to spaceflight would affect NASA's approach to infectious disease risk assessment, development of biological processing systems for exploration, and changes in biodegradation during a mission. Indeed, if these responses are also observed in human cells, they may translate into knowledge of both the astronaut's response to infection and possibly larger physiological responses that are influenced by cellular changes.",,,,,,,,,

However, differences have been found between the properties of type 1 and 2 Seyferts that are inconsistent with simple unification. In some Seyfert 2 galaxies the broad-line region seen in Seyfert 1s may thus have disappeared, which simulations show will happen at very low accretion rates onto the central black hole. Such low accretion rates may be accompanied by declining star formation rates in the host galaxy. We propose to investigate this possibility through a multiwavelength study of the global star formation rates and kiloparsec-scale structure of 42 bright, nearby Seyfert galaxies selected from the Palomar spectral survey. High-quality 2 - 10 keV X-ray spectra of this sample have recently been obtained by XMM-Newton, with associated constraints on the nuclear accretion rates.

The types, dimensions, and locations of the deposits with respect to crater geometry (rim, floor, and location) will be determined for each candidate crater. The flow-field model as a function of crater geometry will be applied to the data set and compared to the inferred wind direction derived from the wind streaks and wind tails seen in the zones adjacent to (but not within) the craters to assess consistency. The overall wind directions derived from the synthesis will then be compared to predictions of wind patterns as a function of time of day and season based on models of the atmosphere for regional scales. If the analysis is successful, then the proposed technique of using the location of aeolian deposits in small craters has the potential for application to the many areas of Mars images by HIRISE to infer local wind patterns.""",,,,,,,,,

A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE IS DETERMINING WHETHER EC COMPOSITIONS AND MINERALS DEVELOPED IN THE NEBULA, BY PARENT-BODY PROCESSING, THROUGH PLANETESIMAL COLLISIONS, OR SOME COMBINATION OF THESE AND OTHER PROCESSES. CHONDRITE MATRIX, BECAUSE OF ITS FINE-GRAINED CHARACTER, IS A SENSITIVE INDICATOR OF ALTERATION PROCESSES.

THE EC MATRIX HAS BEEN LITTLE STUDIED, PERHAPS BECAUSE OF THE RELATIVE RARITY OF UNEQUILIBRATED METEORITES. HOWEVER, METEORITE COLLECTION IN THE ANTARCTIC AND IN DESERT REGIONS HAS RESULTED IN THE RECENT AVAILABILITY OF NUMEROUS EH3 AND EL3 METEORITES.

Previous work by the PI (Desch&Connolly 2002) and his team, including studies funded a previous Origins of Solar Systems grant (Morris et al 2009a,b), have helped establish the viability of passage through shock waves in the solar nebula gas as the model for chondrule formation. We now turn our attention to using models of chondrule formation to constrain the physical conditions in the solar nebula, especially chondrule densities and clumpiness and the sizes and sources of the shocks. Doing so will require a refinement of current shock codes, expanding them to 2 dimensions (cylindrical geometry), to account for variations in chondrule density parallel to the shock front, and to model parabolic bow shocks associated with eccentric planetesimals. We propose to take the Perseus code written by the PI and his research team (Ouellette et al. 2007) to study supernova-driven bow shocks around protoplanetary disks and adapt it to the problem of chondrule formation. The critical modification will be the addition of modules to calculate the radiation field in cylindrical geometry. We describe details of how this and other changes will be achieved. We will apply this modified code to test 3 ideas about chondrule formation by shocks. 1.) Desch&Connolly (2002) hypothesized a correlation between compound chondrules and barred olivine textures because chondrules in clumps experience higher peak temperatures and faster cooling rates. But shock models assume uniform densities on scales of 10^5 km larger than the likely sizes of clumps,<10^3 km, and this idea is not fully tested. 2.) Recent measurements of primary Na in olivine phenocrysts by Alexander et al. (2008) led them to conclude chondrule melts were in equilibrium with high partial pressures of Na, due to partial evaporation of chondrules in exceptionally dense clumps. We instead hypothesize that high vapor pressures result from total evaporation of chondrules in dense clumps, with chondrules melted normally, in nearby regions of lower chondrule density being focused by shocks into the dense, vapor-rich regions. Our code will quantify and test this effect. 3.) Gravitational instabilities are one proposed source of shocks, but bow shocks driven by eccentric planetesimals are a very likely alternative. Proponents of the bow shock model hypothesize that chondrule cooling rates would match observational constraints, but this is untested. Our modified code, which will test the above hypotheses, is highly relevant to NASA's Strategic Goals and Research Objectives, especially subgoals 3C and 3D, and to the goals of the Origins of Solar Systems program. The key to understanding the origin of our solar system is to put chondrule formation in its proper context.",,,,,,,,,

Thus, in order to increase science return for any mission, automated onboard analysis and data selection must take place to return the most relevant data. For the NASA-ESA Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) and particularly the Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO), autonomous science enhancement is crucial to finding evidence of current or recent geophysical activity on Europa. Algorithms for onboard detection of events and surface features that indicate activity, such as thermal anomalies and active plumes, can be matured from existing software for application to Europa. Those algorithms can be tested using currently available data sets and the test results can be analyzed in order to form recommendations for mission concepts. The objectives of this research are to (1) develop onboard decision-making software that will greatly enhance the Europa Flagship mission as well as other potential future planetary missions by (2) developing methods by which software can detect and identify a broad range of science events and phenomena that can be autonomously prioritized for data downlink and/or other spacecraft operations; development of this software and associated hardware and operations concepts will require (3) testing datasets with currently available platforms. This research will focus on finding methods of characterizing surface features and identifying sites of activity. Existing algorithms for autonomous science enhancement developed by Chien et al. at JPL will be adapted for use with the instruments planned for the JEO; they will be modified for characterization and classification of surface features, detection of thermal signatures, and identification of plumes. These algorithms will also include methods for change detection to enable efficient detection of science phenomena such as surface or near surface change on Europa. This will be completed by analyzing current methods of automated feature or change detection and testing similar methods on currently active platforms. Work will include enhancing existing onboard response capabilities such that the software can be applied directly to Europa mission conditions.",,,,,,,,,

The proposed investigation also includes funding for a graduate student to help train the next generation of planetary scientists, as encouraged by the Dawn Science Team. More specifically, the proposed science investigation would include: (Task 1) Identify, characterize, and map any and all volcanic and plutonic features on the surface of Vesta, determine their contact (stratigraphic) relationships with each other and surrounding materials, determine the diversity of the deposits and their source vents (if possible), map their areal extents, and determine their relative ages using superposition relationships and crater counts. Working with Dawn Co-Is we would also identify candidate volcanic features for determining their absolute (cratering model) ages using well-established crater statistical methods. We expect to identify geologic features such as (e.g., impact craters, dikes, sills, lava flows, calderas, lava lakes, shields, domes, cones, layering in the walls of craters exposing lava flows and intrusions, contact boundaries between flow units, potential pyroclastic deposits). However, in the unlikely event that no volcanic or plutonic materials are found on Vesta, we will use the methods discussed above to identify, characterize, and map all other geologic features produced by other processes; (Task 2) Test the predictions of Wilson and Keil (1996, 1997) on the types and dimensions of predicted igneous deposits on Vesta. This would be done by comparing any identified Igneous features to their predictions for lava flow dimensions and the depths of intrusions, as well as by searching for any evidence of explosive pyroclastic deposits (they predict none should occur on Vesta). Additionally, if warranted, we can revisit the mathematical models of Wilson and Keil (1996,1997) with ''in situ'' measurements from FC images (i.e., actual flow dimensions, extents of any pyroclastic material), to investigate any similarities or differences in Vesta's volcanic deposits with their previous model predictions, which will inform about the volumes and rheologies of Vesta's magma compositions and volatile inventory. We would accomplish these objectives through analysis of Framing Camera Images, including use of stereo images (where available) and shadow measurements for depth. We would make geologic maps of interesting and complex areas as tools to further aid the image analysis. Any maps produced would be published in peer-reviewed journals as part of our anticipated papers that would discuss our results and new insights into geologic processes and features found on Vesta. This work would enhance our understanding of the geologic history of this differentiated asteroid, and of the nature and diversity of planetary volcanism in the Solar System, particularly how volcanism operated on a small body. Consequently, this research is directly relevant to NASA's goals for understanding the genesis and evolution of Solar System bodies, and the Dawn science objectives of understanding the origin and evolution of this unique asteroid.",,,,,,,,,

N-containing ammonia, amino acids and amines are preponderant and compounds such as aldehydes and ketones are abundant as well as. The study of CR2 diastereomer amino acids also allowed the inference of an original asymmetry in their precursor aldehydes. In light of the uniqueness and clear prebiotic implications of these findings, studies are proposed towards gaining a fuller understanding of CR2 chiral and molecular composition as well as assessing prebiotically realistic pathways of early Earth evolution for selected amino acids of meteoritic distribution. Extend the search for possible enantiomeric excesses to CR2 hydroxy- and monocarboxylic acids that, like amino acids, might have formed from aldehyde precursors. Search CR2 extracts for N-containing compounds of prebiotic significance (HCN, formamide, urea, peptides) that have not yet been identified but could be abundant in these meteorites. Assess the possible formation of small peptides from standard amino acid pools of CR2 and CR2/CM2 mixed composition under prebiotic settings. Continue the study of the chiral interactions between sugars and amino acids in a water-based prebiotic model. Methodologies developed through the years in our laboratory will allow a ready chiral investigation of hydoxy-, monocarboxylic acids. Methodologies for the analyses of other compounds and model experiments will be developed, following literature and preliminary experimental findings. These studies will broaden our understanding of cosmochemical samples with unique prebiotic potential, address anew the basic exobiological question of whether extraterrestrial organic compounds contributed to terrestrial molecular evolution and will provide relevant data on how this evolution might have proceeded upon delivery to the early Earth of organic materials with CR or CR/CM mixed-compositions.",,,,,,,,,

The quantification of history"" requires precise and accurate dating of impact events. Noble gas geochronology of melted or shocked target rocks is historically one of the most successful approaches to dating impacts, but the most advanced techniques developed since the Apollo era for terrestrial Ar and He geochronology are not commonly applied to extraterrestrial samples. For example, state-of-the-art 40Ar/39Ar geochronology of frictional melts associated with major fault zones (pseudotachylites) typically employs the extremely high spatial resolution of ultraviolet (UV) laser microprobes to selectively ablate and analyze glassy or recrystallized domains in polished petrographic thin sections while avoiding contamination by older xenolithic or xenocrystic materials. Since many of the scientific challenges involved in geochronologic studies of impact melts are identical to those involved in geochronologic studies of impact melts, we propose to evaluate the utility of 40Ar/39Ar UV laser microprobe dating of lunar impact melts through two studies. The first involves using this technique to date materials from the Mistastin Lake Impact Crater, northern Labrador. Target rocks of the ca. 36 Ma Mistastin Lake impact are intermediate to mafic igneous rocks (primarily anorthosites, hypersthene monzonites, and granodiorites), such that studies in and around this crater provide a unique opportunity to study impact melts and breccias that are among the best lithologic analogues on Earth for samples that may be encountered in future explorations of impact sites on the Moon (such as South Pole-Aitken). More importantly for our purposes, the Mistastin Lake impactites are simple by comparison to lunar impactites, which record a complex history of multiple impact events. In the more ambitious second study, we will move on to the more difficult problem of dating polyphase Apollo 17 impact breccias by 40Ar/39Ar UV laser microprobe, with an eye toward comparing the results to previous impact chronologies developed through conventional 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb ion microprobe work by other research teams and hopefully expanding our knowledge of the impact record in the Taurus-Littrow valley. In this way, we will determine whether or not the higher spatial resolution of UV laser microprobe studies add extra value to impact chronology studies beyond that provided by more conventional techniques. Finally, our last study represents the first reconnaissance application of the (U-Th)/He UV laser microprobe in impact chronology studies. Recently, applications of conventional (U-Th)/He zircon and apatite dating techniques have provided important constraints on the ages of some major terrestrial impact structures, but similar studies on lunar samples will likely necessitate the use of more advanced, laser ablation techniques that permit analyses of very small samples. The (U-Th)/He UV laser microprobe is a perfect tool for such studies, but it has not been tested on terrestrial or extraterrestrial impactites. We intend to explore the utility of this technique by applying it to zircons and phosphates from the Mistastin and Apollo 17 impactites. """,,,,,,,,,

VFTs transport users to remote environments where they can explore terrain and experience what it is like to ""do science"" in the field. This virtual experience is dynamic, immersive and interactive with 360## sphericals that open windows onto Gigapan imagery that allow a user to examine rock faces in close-ups that mimic actual presence at the rock face.

They have been studied extensively in concentrates made from acid-insoluble residues, but surprisingly little is known about their petrologic settings in the meteorites because they have not been studied in situ. Information about such settings is fundamental for determining how they formed and were incorporated into the meteorites. The primary goal of the planned research is to determine and compare the petrologic settings of NDs within matrix of different types of carbonaceous chondrites, with the long-term aim of providing new insights regarding the origin of NDs. This research will also provide new data on the structure and major and trace element compositions of individual NDs and regions within them. Transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) provide uniquely powerful information regarding chemical, bonding, and structural data on the scale needed to solve this problem, assuming the NDs can be located within the host matrix. We have developed methods of observing NDs in situ within the fine-grained matrix of primitive meteorites and will use various TEMs to accomplish that goal for several meteorites. High-resolution imaging and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) will permit determination of both structural and chemical information about the NDs and their adjacent minerals. By the middle of the proposed grant period, two state-of-the-art, aberration-corrected TEMs will have been installed at ASU and will be used to locate heavy elements such as Xe, Te, and Pd within the NDs. These TEMs permit the imaging of individual atoms of heavy elements with annular dark-field (ADF) imaging, and these atoms can be identified using EELS. The result of these new types of measurements will provide information about whether such elements, which have been used to determine whether NDs formed in supernovae, occur within the interiors or on the surfaces of the NDs.

BASALT THAT MAKES UP THE EARTH&#039;S OCEANIC CRUST IS GENERATED FROM THE PARTIAL MELTING OF ROCKS THAT HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED ULTRAMAFIC COMPOSITIONS. THE EARTH&#039;S MANTLE IS COMPOSED OF ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS, THEY ARE COMMON IN ASTEROIDS AND ON MARS, AND ARE THOUGHT TO BE PRESENT IN ICY SATELLITES THROUGHOUT THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM. WHEN ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS REACT WITH WATER, THE ALTERED ROCKS CONTAIN HYDROUS SILICATE MINERALS OF THE SERPENTINE GROUP, SO THE ALTERATION OF ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS IS CALLED SERPENTINIZATION. THIS IS THE MOST COMMON AND ARGUABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ALTERATION REACTION IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM. DURING SERPENTINIZATION, SOME OF THE WATER IS REDUCED TO HYDROGEN AS FERROUS IRON IS OXIDIZED TO FERRIC IRON. THE PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN DURING SERPENTINIZATION CREATES THE MOST REDUCED AQUEOUS FLUIDS FOUND ON THE EARTH. THESE REDUCED CONDITIONS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR ABIOTIC SYNTHESIS OF METHANE AND ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. BECAUSE SERPENTINIZATION IS WIDESPREAD ACROSS OUR SOLAR SYSTEM, ITS ROLE IN ABIOTIC ORGANIC SYNTHESIS MAY BE AS WELL. THE SAME CONDITIONS ARE IDEAL FOR SUPPORTING METHANOGENS, MICROBES THAT GAIN ENERGY BY REDUCING CARBON DIOXIDE WITH HYDROGEN TO PRODUCE METHANE. IT FOLLOWS THAT SERPENTINIZATION MAY REPRESENT ONE OF THE EARLIEST HABITAT-FORMING PROCESSES ON EARTH. WE HAVE DOCUMENTED THE PRESENCE OF DISSOLVED HYDROGEN, METHANE AND ORGANIC COMPOUNDS IN SERPENTINIZING FLUIDS THAT EMERGE FROM EXTREMELY ALKALINE SPRINGS HOSTED IN ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS OF THE SAMAIL OPHIOLITE OF OMAN. THESE FLUIDS ORIGINATE AS SURFACE WATERS, BUT THEIR COMPOSITIONS ARE RADICALLY CHANGED DURING SERPENTINIZATION. THE CONCENTRATIONS OF HYDROGEN AND METHANE EXCEED BY MANY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE THE CORRESPONDING CONCENTRATIONS IN SURFACE WATERS, WHICH WE ALSO ANALYZED. IN OUR DATA, CONCENTRATIONS OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC) IN SERPENTINIZING FLUIDS ARE ALWAYS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THE DOC IN SURFACE WATER. AT THE SAME TIME, THE DOC IN THE SERPENTINIZATION FLUIDS REPRESENTS ONLY A FRACTION OF THE DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON (DIC) IN THE SURFACE WATER. IT FOLLOWS THAT SYNTHESIS OF HYDROGEN, METHANE, AND ORGANIC COMPOUNDS OCCURS DURING SERPENTINIZATION. WHAT IS UNCLEAR IS WHETHER THE METHANE AND DOC HAVE ABIOTIC OR BIOTIC ORIGINS. THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO EXPLORE WHETHER THE METHANE AND DOC FORMED DURING SERPENTINIZATION IS DRIVEN BY BIOTIC OR ABIOTIC PROCESSES. WE WILL DETERMINE WHETHER MICROBES ARE PRESENT IN THE ZONE OF ACTIVE SERPENTINIZATION, AND WHETHER THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE METHANE AND DOC IN THE SERPENTINIZING FLUIDS. WE WILL ALSO CHARACTERIZE THE DISSOLVED ORGANIC COMPOUNDS TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE PRODUCTS OF MICROBIAL METABOLISM OR ABIOTIC SYNTHESIS CATALYZED BY THE SERPENTINIZATION PROCESS. FIELD WORK IN OMAN WILL CHARACTERIZE THE GEOLOGIC CONTEXT AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF SURFACE WATERS AND SERPENTINIZING FLUIDS. SAMPLES WILL BE RETURNED FOR LAB ANALYSIS OF MAJOR AND TRACE ELEMENTS, DIC, DOC, CARBON ISOTOPES, AND CHARACTERIZATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS THAT MAKE UP THE DOC. GEOCHEMICAL MODELING WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE RESULTING ORGANIC COMPOUNDS ARE PLAUSIBLE PRODUCTS OF ABIOTIC SYNTHESIS. WE WILL ALSO COLLECT SAMPLES FOR MOLECULAR ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE PRESENCE AND IDENTITY OF MICROBES. WE WILL START WITH SMALL SUBUNIT RNA ANALYSIS TO SEARCH FOR METHANOGENS AND OTHER STRICTLY ANAEROBIC ORGANISMS, COMPLEMENTED BY SEARCHES FOR SPECIFIC GENES INVOLVED IN CARBON FIXATION DURING METHANOGENESIS AND OTHER METABOLIC PATHWAYS.

DEVELOPING A COMPLETE PICTURE OF THIS HISTORY IS CENTRAL TO UNDERSTANDING OUR COSMIC ORIGINS. YET WE HAVE LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE FIRST BILLION YEARS WHEN THE FIRST GALAXIES AND BLACK HOLES FORMED AND THE UNIVERSE UNDERWENT A GLOBAL PHASE TRANSITION FROM NEUTRAL TO IONIZED DURING THE EPOCH OF REIONIZATION (EOR). DURING THIS ERA OF COSMIC DAWN ARE SOME OF THE MOST CRITICAL EVENTS IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE. IT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL PERIOD WHEN PRIMORDIAL DENSITY FLUCTUATIONS FOLLOWING INFLATION EVOLVED THROUGH BARYON IN-FALL, ADIABATIC COOLING, AND GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE TO CREATE COMPACT STRUCTURES FOR THE FIRST TIME. BUT PROBING THIS ERA IS BEYOND THE CAPABILITIES OF TODAY\'S INSTRUMENTS. NEW APPROACHES ARE NEEDED TO ENABLE BREAK-THROUGH OBSERVATIONS. ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING NEW TECHNIQUES FOR PROBING COSMIC DAWN IS LOW-FREQUENCY RADIO OBSERVATION OF THE REDSHIFTED 21CM LINE OF NEUTRAL HYDROGEN GAS. IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE, THE INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM (IGM) IS DOMINATED BY NEUTRAL HYDROGEN GAS. THE THERMAL AND IONIZATION HISTORY OF THE INTERGALACTIC GAS ENCODES UNIQUE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROPERTIES OF THE FIRST STARS, GALAXIES, AND BLACK HOLES. THE EVOLUTION OF ABSORPTION AND EMISSION FEATURES IN THE DIFFUSE REDSHIFTED 21 CM LINE RELATIVE TO THE COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND (CMB) WILL BE IMPRINTED SPECTRALLY IN THE ALL-SKY AVERAGE RADIO BACKGROUND BETWEEN 40 AND 200 MHZ (WAVELENGTHS BETWEEN 1.5 AND 8 METERS), SINCE REDSHIFT MAPS TO WAVELENGTH FOR THE 21 CM LINE. THE BEST MEASUREMENTS OF THE GLOBAL 21 CM SIGNAL FROM COSMIC DAWN WILL BE ACQUIRED FROM SPACE. ALTHOUGH THIS WAVELENGTH RANGE IS GENERALLY ACCESSIBLE FROM THE GROUND, THE EARTH S IONOSPHERE SEVERELY COMPLICATES THE OBSERVATIONS BELOW 80 MHZ AND RADIO FREQUENCY INTERFERENCE FROM TERRESTRIAL TRANSMITTERS, INCLUDING FM RADIO AND TELEVISION, LIMITS THE AVAILABLE SPECTRUM, EVEN AT VERY REMOTE, RADIO-QUIET SITES. DETECTING THE WEAK COMIC DAWN SIGNAL UNDER MUCH BRIGHTER GALACTIC AND EXTRAGALACTIC FOREGROUNDS WILL REQUIRE A HIGH-PRECISION, WIDEBAND RADIO SPECTROMETER WITH THE UNIQUE PROPERTY THAT ITS RELATIVE SPECTRAL RESPONSE OVER LARGE FRACTIONAL WAVEBANDS IS WELL UNDERSTOOD AT BETTER THAN 1 PART IN 10,000. SUCH A SPECTROMETER WILL EXPLOIT THE DIFFERENCE IN COHERENCE LENGTH BETWEEN THE 21 CM SIGNAL AND THE POWER-LAW SPECTRUM OF THE FOREGROUND SYNCHROTRON EMISSION TO SEPARATE THE TWO COMPONENTS IN OBSERVATIONS. THEWIDEBAND SPECTRAL PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT FOR THE COSMIC DAWN RECEIVER IS TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE BEYOND EXISTING RADIO INSTRUMENTS AND NEW TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT IS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THE PERFORMANCE GOALS IN A FLIGHT-QUALIFIED INSTRUMENT. HERE, WE PROPOSE A CONCEPT STUDY TO IDENTIFY THE BEST WIDEBAND RECEIVER DESIGN. THE OUTCOME OF THE STUDY WILL LEAD TO A NEXT-GENERATION RECEIVER THAT WILL BE BUILT AND VALIDATED IN THE SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. A PROTOTYPE RECEIVER WILL BE EVALUATED DURING THE CONCEPT STUDY THAT IS BASED ON DESIGN LESSONS FROM A GROUND-BASED PRECURSOR THAT ISOLATE DESIGN CHALLENGES TO THE ELECTRICAL INTERFACE BETWEEN THE ANTENNA AND FIRST-STAGE AMPLIFIERS. THE PROTOTYPE RECEIVER UTILIZES A DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER CONFIGURATION THAT IS COMMON IN SPACE-QUALIFIED SYSTEMS. BOTH DESIGNS FEATURE CALIBRATION NOISE SOURCES INJECTED BEFORE THE FIRST-STAGE AMPLIFIERS, BUT THEY EXHIBIT DIFFERENT TECHNICAL COMPLICATIONS THAT MUST BE EVALUATED AND RESOLVED. THE RESEARCH ACTIVITIES PROPOSED HERE WILL ADVANCE THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE IN PRECISION WIDEBAND RECEIVER DESIGN. THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT HAS APPLICATIONS TO THE DARK AGES RADIO EXPLORE (DARE) MISSION CONCEPT AND TO FUTURE SPACE MISSIONS IN EARTH OBSERVING, SOLAR WEATHER, PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES, AND COSMOLOGY.",,,,,,,,,

EXPERIENCE WITH MARS GLOBAL SURVEYOR TES AND THE MARS EXPLORATION ROVER MINI-TES DATA DEMONSTRATED THAT WAVELENGTHS>15?M CONTAIN SOME OF THE MOST DIAGNOSTIC SPECTRAL INFORMATION. SPECTROMETERS AND MULTI-SPECTRAL IMAGERS USING COOLED DETECTORS THEREFORE HAVE ONLY LIMITED UTILITY IN SPECTRAL ANALYSIS, AND ARE FURTHER LIMITED FOR COLD, OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM OBJECTS WHERE THE PEAK OF THE EMITTED ENERGY OCCURS IN THE 20-50?M REGION. THE DEVELOPMENT OF MICROBOLOMETER ARRAYS THAT ARE SENSITIVE OVER A WIDE SPECTRAL RANGE (3 TO 100?M) HAS DIRECT APPLICATION TO FUTURE MARS, LUNAR, AND INNER PLANET MISSIONS WHERE LOW COST, HIGH-PERFORMANCE IR IMAGERS AND SPECTROMETERS WILL PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN THE STUDY OF SURFACE AND ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES. THEY WOULD BE USEFUL ON ROVERS AND LANDERS WHERE RAPID, MULTI-SPECTRAL IMAGING WOULD PROVIDE CRITICAL COMPOSITIONAL INFORMATION FOR TRAVERSE AND OPERATIONS PLANNING. AND THESE SIMPLE, LOW COST, LOW MASS IMAGERS COULD PROVIDE A COMPLEMENT TO VISIBLE/NEAR-IR IMAGING ON VIRTUALLY ANY MISSION. HOWEVER, AT PRESENT THE USE OF MICROBOLOMETERS ON PLANETARY MISSIONS IS LIMITED BECAUSE THEIR PERFORMANCE OVER AN EXTENDED SPECTRAL RANGE (3 TO 100?M) HAS NOT BEEN CHARACTERIZED. WE PROPOSE TO ADDRESS THIS LIMITATION BY DEVELOPING AND TESTING A SMALL, MICROBOLOMETER-BASED IMAGER THAT IS SENSITIVE OVER A BROAD SPECTRAL RANGE. THIS WORK WILL DEVELOP A 640X480 PIXEL FOCAL PLANE ASSEMBLY (FPA) THAT IS BASED ON THE 320X240 PIXEL MICROBOLOMETER ARRAY THAT WAS FLOWN IN THE MARS ODYSSEY THEMIS IR CAMERA. THE GOAL OF THIS EFFORT IS TO PRODUCE A WORKING PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT AND DEMONSTRATE THE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE OVER A SPECTRAL RANGE OF 3 TO 100?M. THE SPECIFIC TASKS OF THIS EFFORT ARE TO: 1) FULLY CHARACTERIZE THE RADIOMETRIC PERFORMANCE FROM 3 TO 100?M OF AN EXISTING 640X480 MICROBOLOMETER THAT WILL BE MODIFIED TO USE A LONG-WAVELENGTH TRANSMISSIVE DIAMOND WINDOW. 2) DESIGN AND DEVELOP A FILTER WHEEL ASSEMBLY AND REFLECTIVE OPTICAL SYSTEM THAT ARE OPTIMIZED TO THE MICROBOLOMETER FOCAL PLANE ASSEMBLY TO PROVIDE HIGH-QUALITY MULTI-SPECTRAL IMAGING. 3) INTEGRATE THE MICROBOLOMETER, FILTER WHEEL, AND OPTICS, AND TEST AND CALIBRATE THIS SYSTEM TO PRODUCE A SMALL, LOW-MASS PROTOTYPE IR MULTI-SPECTRAL IMAGER FOR USE ON PLANETARY MISSIONS. 4) CO",,,,,,,,,

A RECENT DISCOVERY OF CARBONATE-RICH ROCKS IN THE COLUMBIA HILLS MADE POSSIBLE IN PART BY REVISITING FOUR-YEAR-OLD MINI-TES SPECTRA, HIGHLIGHTS OUR MOTIVATION TO CONTINUE INVESTIGATING SPIRIT&#039;S MINI-TES DATA SET. THIS DISCOVERY WAS IMPEDED BY DUST IN THE MARTIAN ENVIRONMENT, WHICH PRODUCES SIGNIFICANT BUT CORRECTABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO MINI-TES SPECTRA.

TASKS 2 AND 3 WILL INCORPORATE THESE OBSERVATIONS, LABORATORY SPECTRA FROM OTHER NASA FUNDED PROJECTS, AND VARIOUS ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO OBTAIN NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE SILICA AND CARBONATE OCCURRENCES THAT CAN BE USED TO BETTER CONSTRAIN THEIR ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE. WE EXPECT THAT THE RESULTS FROM THESE TASKS WILL PROVIDE A MORE THOROUGH EVALUATION OF THE ROLE OF WATER AND OTHER GEOLOGIC PROCESSES IN GUSEV CRATER.

LODDERS, 2003; PALME AND JONES, 2003) AND SOLAR PHOTOSPHERIC CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES (E.G. ASPLUND ET AL., 2006). THE OUTER PORTION OF THE SUN, THE SOLAR PHOTOSPHERE, IS THOUGHT TO BE DECOUPLED FROM NUCLEOSYNTHETIC PROCESSES, LEAVING IT ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED IN COMPOSITION FROM THAT OF THE EARLY SOLAR NEBULA (BOCHSLER, 2000). IONIZED PARTICLES ARE ACCELERATED BY THE SOLAR MAGNETIC FIELD OUT OF THE PHOTOSPHERE, CONSTITUTING WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE SOLAR WIND. BY SAMPLING THE SOLAR WIND, IT IS THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE TO ANALYZE THE CHEMISTRY OF THE PHOTOSPHERE IN TERRESTRIAL LABORATORIES AND DRAW CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE EARLY SOLAR NEBULA; THIS IS THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH. SOLAR WIND (SW) IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR SOLAR ABUNDANCES OF VOLATILE ELEMENTS (BOCHSLER, 2007). THE GENESIS MISSION SURPASSED THE APOLLO 16 SOLAR WIND COMPOSITION EXPERIMENT BY RETURNING THE LONGEST EXPOSURE SOLAR WIND SAMPLE TO DATE (REISENFELD ET AL., 2007), MAKING ITS COLLECTOR ARRAYS PARTICULARLY VALUABLE FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF SW MINOR ELEMENT ABUNDANCES AND ISOTOPIC COMPOSITIONS (E.G., HEBER ET AL., 2009; JUREWICZ ET AL., 2009; RIECK ET AL., 2010). ONE HIGHLY VOLATILE ELEMENT THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN WELL-STUDIED IN THE GENESIS COLLECTOR ARRAYS, BUT IS PRESENT IN SUFFICIENT CONCENTRATION FOR SIMS ANALYSIS, IS NA. WE WILL MEASURE SW FLUENCES OF NA IN THE NASA GENESIS SPACECRAFT DIAMOND-LIKE CARBON (DLC) BULK COLLECTOR WAFERS. IN ADDITION, IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER GENESIS TEAM MEMBERS, THE ABUNDANCES OF CA AND CR WILL BE ANALYZED IN THESE WAFERS TO ASSESS THE CONSISTENCY OF THESE DATA BETWEEN LABORATORIES. RECONNAISSANCE MEASUREMENTS OF NA, CA, AND CR WERE PERFORMED PREVIOUSLY BY OTHER INVESTIGATORS ON THE ASU 6F SIMS AND THE UCLA 1270 SIMS (E.G. JUREWICZ ET AL., 2007; BURNETT ET AL., 2007) AS WELL AS RIMS (VERYOVKIN ET AL., 2010A, B). THIS PRIOR WORK, ALL USING TRADITIONAL DEPTH PROFILING, DEMONSTRATED THAT THESE ELEMENTS ARE, INDEED, ABUNDANT ENOUGH TO BE MEASURED USING SIMS. HOWEVER, IN ALL CASES, SURFACE CONTAMINATION DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS CREATED UNACCEPTABLE INTERFERENCE WITH THE SW SIGNAL. WE BELIEVE WE CAN ADDRESS THIS ANALYTICAL CHALLENGE BY CONDUCTING BACKSIDE DEPTH PROFILING INTO THE DLC COLLECTOR WAFERS USING SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY (SIMS). BACKSIDE DEPTH PROFILING HAS RECENTLY BEEN DEVELOPED FOR ANALYSIS OF GENESIS SI COLLECTORS (E.G., HEBER ET AL., 2012) TO REDUCE THE CONTRIBUTION OF SURFACE PARTICULATE CONTAMINATION AND PERMIT ION BEAM STABILIZATION PRIOR TO ENCOUNTERING IMPLANTED IONS.

ACHIEVING THIS GOAL REQUIRES THE PRECISE AND ACCURATE DATING OF LUNAR ROCKS THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY IMPACTS (IMPACTITES). THE 40AR/39AR METHOD HAS BEEN WIDELY USED TO DATE IMPACT EVENTS SINCE THE K-AR ISOTOPIC SYSTEM MAY BE RESET DURING IMPACTS, AND BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THE EFFECTIVE ANALYSIS OF SMALL QUANTITIES OF RARE SAMPLES. CONVENTIONAL 40AR/39AR TECHNIQUES TYPICALLY INVOLVE STEP-HEATING OF SMALL WHOLE-ROCK FRAGMENTS OR MINERAL SEPARATES IN A FURNACE OR BY INFRARED LASERS TO RELEASE GASSES FOR ANALYSIS IN A MASS SPECTROMETER. IN MOST CASES, THE PETROGRAPHIC CONTEXT OF THE DATED MATERIAL IS LOST IN THE PROCESS OF ISOLATING IT FOR ANALYSIS, AND THE PRESENCE OF UNMELTED MINERALS MAY ENGENDER AGE INTERPRETATIONS THAT ARE AMBIGUOUS OR THAT HAVE LITTLE GEOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE TIMING OF IMPACT. ADDITIONALLY, THE THERMAL HISTORIES OF LUNAR IMPACTITES ARE COMPLEX, AND MAY BE REFLECTED BY MULTIPLE GENERATIONS OF IMPACT MELTS AND SHOCK EFFECTS WITHIN INDIVIDUAL SAMPLES. THE APPLICATION OF ULTRAVIOLET (UV) LASER ABLATION TECHNIQUES IN 40AR/39AR GEOCHRONOLOGY PROVIDES THE ABILITY TO STUDY SUCH COMPLEXITIES IN PETROGRAPHIC CONTEXT.

NEVERTHELESS, THESE NEW ESTIMATES WILL STILL HAVE COARSE RESOLUTIONS AS COMPARED TO EXISTING GROUND NETWORKS (#tilde#10S M) AND AIRCRAFT-BASED ESTIMATES (#tilde#1 KM). AS A RESULT, A MAJOR CHALLENGE IS HOW TO PROPERLY DOWNSCALE (OR DISAGGREGATE) THESE COARSE (BUT RELATIVELY ACCURATE) ESTIMATES TO RESOLUTIONS THAT ARE MORE USEFUL FOR HYDROLOGIC, ECOLOGIC, AND CLIMATOLOGIC APPLICATIONS, AMONG OTHERS. UNFORTUNATELY, MANY EXISTING SOIL MOISTURE DOWNSCALING APPROACHES ARE NOT SUITED FOR OPERATIONAL AND GLOBAL APPLICATION DUE TO THEIR HIGH COMPUTATIONAL DEMAND, LARGE DATA AND PARAMETER REQUIREMENTS OR SITE-SPECIFICITY. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL USE A STATISTICAL DOWNSCALING MODEL FOR GENERATING HIGH-RESOLUTION SOIL MOISTURE FIELDS FROM COARSE SATELLITE DATA THAT HAS SHOWN PROMISE IN PRIOR APPLICATIONS. THE DOWNSCALING MODEL IS BASED ON SCALE-INVARIANCE AND MULTIFRACTAL PROPERTIES EXHIBITED BY SOIL MOISTURE FIELDS OBTAINED FROM AIRCRAFT-BASED SENSORS FLOWN DURING INTENSIVE NASA FIELD CAMPAIGNS. THE ALGORITHM HAS THE PROPERTIES THAT ARE SOUGHT FOR OPERATIONAL AND GLOBAL USE (I.E., LOW COMPUTATIONAL DEMAND AND A FEW PARAMETERS THAN CAN BE LINKED TO READILY-AVAILABLE DATA, ROBUSTNESS ACROSS MULTIPLE SITES). FURTHERMORE, THE DOWNSCALING METHOD GENERATES AN ENSEMBLE (A LARGE SET OF REALIZATIONS) OF HIGH-RESOLUTION SOIL MOISTURE FIELDS (#tilde#1 KM OR LESS) THAT STATISTICALLY ENCOMPASS AVAILABLE AIRCRAFT-BASED OBSERVATIONS. WE PROPOSE TWO MAJOR ACTIVITIES THAT WILL EXPAND THE USEFULNESS OF THE STATISTICAL DOWNSCALING MODEL. IN THE FIRST ACTIVITY, THE DOWNSCALING ALGORITHM WILL BE APPLIED TO ALL AVAILABLE AIRCRAFT-BASED DATA TO DEVELOP A ROBUST, MULTI-SITE CALIBRATION RELATION. THIS WILL BE CARRIED OUT FROM TWO COARSE RESOLUTIONS REPRESENTING THE OPERATIONAL AMRS-E (25 KM) AND FORTHCOMING SMAP (10 KM) PRODUCTS TO TEST THE VALUE ADDED BY THE NEW PRODUCT. IN THE SECOND ACTIVITY, THE DOWNSCALING MODEL WILL BE CALIBRATED USING HIGH-RESOLUTION (10 TO 100 M) SOIL MOISTURE FIELDS GENERATED BY A DISTRIBUTED HYDROLOGIC MODEL APPLIED TO BASINS WITHIN THE MULTIPLE STUDY SITES. MODEL-DERIVED SOIL MOISTURE FIELDS WILL ALLOW EXPANDING THE HYDROLOGIC CONDITIONS AND SCALE RANGE OF THE DOWNSCALING MODEL APPLICATION. FOR BOTH ACTIVITIES, THE ENSEMBLE SOIL MOISTURE FIELDS CAN SERVE AS A STATISTICAL BENCHMARK TO TEST THE USEFULNESS OF THE FORTHCOMING SMAP (AT ITS NATIVE RESOLUTION) AND TO OBTAIN THE SMALL-SCALE VARIABILITY WITHIN SMAP FOOTPRINTS FOR APPLICATIONS AT HIGH RESOLUTION.",,,,,,,,,

IN PARTICULAR, A LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO INCREASE WATER RECOVERY FROM WASTEWATERS TO CREATE A CLOSED-LOOP WATER RECYCLING SYSTEM. CURRENTLY, IN THE WATER RECOVERY SYSTEM (WRS) USED ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS) ONLY 70% OF THE WASTEWATER GENERATED IS RECOVERED; THE REMAINING 30% OF THE WATER IS BRINE THAT IS STORED FOR LATER DISPOSAL. UNDER THIS SYSTEM, WASTEWATER RECYCLING IS DEPENDENT ON RESUPPLY OF WATER FROM THE GROUND TO THE ISS. SINCE NASA HAS RETIRED THE SPACE SHUTTLE FLEET, THE NEED TO MINIMIZE USE OF GROUND-BASED RESOURCES IS A HIGHER PRIORITY. AS A RESULT, NASA FACES THE CHALLENGE OF EITHER DEVELOPING NEW WASTEWATER RECYCLING SYSTEMS OR OPTIMIZING EXISTING ONES TO MAXIMIZE WATER RECOVERY. CURRENT OSMOTIC PROCESSES   BOTH REVERSE OSMOSIS (RO) AND FORWARD OSMOSIS (FO)   OFFER THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE WATER RECOVERY FROM WASTEWATERS CONSISTING OF RAW URINE, PRE-TREATED URINE, AND URINE BRINES. HOWEVER, COMMERCIAL RO AND FO MEMBRANES RAPIDLY DEGRADE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE ACIDIC PRE-TREATED URINE AND URINE BRINES. ADDITIONALLY, THESE COMMERCIAL RO AND FO MEMBRANES ARE FLAWED IN THAT THEY ARE NOT A SUFFICIENT BARRIER TO SMALL ORGANIC COMPOUNDS COMMONLY FOUND IN URINE, SUCH AS UREA. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A NEW CLASS OF CORROSION-RESISTANT MOLECULAR SIEVE INCLUSION NANOCOMPOSITE (MOSIN) MEMBRANES AND TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS FOR RECOVERING WATER FROM URINE AND URINE BRINE SOLUTIONS THROUGH OSMOTIC PROCESSES. IN OUR MOSIN MEMBRANES, A LIQUID-BARRIER, CHEMICAL-RESISTANT POLYMER MATRIX BINDS A LAYER OF SELECTIVE MOLECULAR SIEVE NANOPARTICLES INTO A FLEXIBLE, ROBUST NANOCOMPOSITE THIN FILM. THIS DESIGN LEVERAGES UNIQUE ASPECTS OF THE TWO COMPONENT MATERIALS: (1) THE HIGH INTRINSIC FLUX AND SELECTIVITY OF THE MOLECULAR SIEVE NANOPARTICLES AND (2) THE CORROSION-RESISTANCE, FLEXIBILITY, AND MECHANICAL ROBUSTNESS OF THE LIQUIDBARRIER POLYMER SUPPORT MATRIX. UNLIKE TRADITIONAL POLYMERIC LIQUID FILTRATION MEMBRANES, OUR DESIGN DOES NOT REQUIRE THE POLYMER MATRIX TO HAVE LIQUID PERMEABILITY A FACT THAT ENABLES US TO USE A BROADER SPECTRUM OF CORROSION-RESISTANT POLYMERS. TWO KEY ASPECTS OF THIS DESIGN CONCEPT ARE: (1) THE MOLECULAR SIEVE NANOPARTICLES PROVIDE A SINGLE PARTICLE PATHWAY THROUGH THE SUPPORTING POLYMERIC MATRIX BECAUSE THEY PENETRATE BOTH SIDES OF THE FILM AND (2) OUR MEMBRANES WILL BE FABRICATED THROUGH INEXPENSIVE POLYMER PROCESSING TECHNIQUES. WE WILL INCORPORATE HIGH PERMEABILITY WATER-SELECTIVE LINDE TYPE A (LTA) ZEOLITE MOLECULAR SIEVE NANOPARTICLES INTO CORROSION RESISTANT POLYMERIC THIN FILMS (POLYETHYLENE TEREPHTHALATE, HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE AND POLYTETRAFLUOROETHYLENE). WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE FUNDAMENTAL CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS WHICH INFLUENCE THE FORMATION OF OUR MOSIN MEMBRANES. IN PARTICULAR WE WILL INVESTIGATE HOW CHANGES IN FABRICATION PARAMETERS RELATE TO THE CHEMICAL STRUCTURE, PHYSICAL MORPHOLOGY, OSMOTIC SEPARATION PERFORMANCE, AND ZEOLITE/POLYMER INTERFACE USING A VARIETY OF CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES. WE WILL EVALUATE THE LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE AND CORROSION RESISTANCE OF THE MEMBRANES IN FORWARD OSMOSIS FOR DEWATERING OF SYNTHETIC URINE AND PRE-TREATED URINE. WE WILL EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MEMBRANES IN REVERSE OSMOSIS FOR WATER RECOVERY FROM CONCENTRATED URINE BRINES.",,,,,,,,,

This expansion of existing the Earth Camp program is a  partnership between the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, the Planetary Science Institute and Arizona Project WET at the Water Resources Research Center, University of Arizona. Teens and teachers who participate in Earth Camp programs are immersed in the study of water resources on a Powers of 10"" framework, from the smallest scale properties of the water molecule, to intermediate scales of water in desert ecosystems, to the global scale of climate change and predicted impacts on the water cycle. Together, teen and teacher participants will apply their knowledge and communicate their results through interactive displays: The Power of Perspective, using NASA satellite images and data to illustrate regional changes to the water-energy-climate system. Using snapshots of the global view enjoyed by Laurel Clark, they will learn and teach about the connections between their lives and the changing Earth System. The Earth Camp Experience offers a progression of learning from the concrete to the abstract that recognizes that education is a process of preparing learners for the future and helping them engage in meaningful work as well as lifelong pursuits of value. Informal learning opportunities afford the time and space for students to assess the efficacy of their efforts, interpret and evaluate data, re-examine beliefs and understandings, develop their own scientific inquiry via data collection and analysis, apply their learning through action and communicate their findings. This STEM experience will include authentic field and laboratory studies, engaging activities that employ multiple learning modalities, collaborative group work, mathematical thinking skills that contribute to problem solving, applied learning opportunities, and systems thinking that undergirds the creation of solutions. Collaborative learning groups of teens and teachers will immerse themselves in the NASA Earth Science focus areas of Water and Energy Cycles and Climate Variability and Change. Together the teens and teachers will engage in intergenerational problem solving, informal teaching through exhibits, and community education projects. The Earth Camp Experience is composed of six elements: Workshops for Informal Science Educators, Summer Earth Camp Programs for Teens, Teacher Earth Camp, Exhibit Design Workshop (with traveling poster and on-line exhibits) and Earth Clubs at Schools, all coming together to create a cohort of Earth Stewards dedicated to education and informed environmental decision-making. The Earth Camp Experience will support NASA's Education Strategy and Framework by: 1. Strengthening the pipeline to the STEM workforce: Earth Camp serves middle and high school students, about 40% of whom come from backgrounds underrepresented in STEM disciplines. With NASA funding, we will be able to recruit additional students from underrepresented groups, with a goal of 75% underrepresented students. The new track for middle and high school teachers will also greatly expand the impact of the existing Earth Camp program. 2. Engaging Americans in NASA's mission: The Power of Perspective interactive display and exhibit will be displayed at the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum (ASDM: 450,000 visitors/year), on the ASDM website (1 million unique visitors/year), on the Arizona Project WET web site to reach teachers, and at community sites throughout the region.""",,,,,,,,,

ASRL, the non-profit arm of the previous magazine support contractor Turbo, Inc. (for which Shearer is also director) will provide a seamless transition from prior support services for the magazine on a daily basis by continuing services such as managing emails, hosting, migration, new features and development, daily designing tasks, banner updates etc. on the website. It further proposes to greatly augment previous capabilities with major new multi-media platforms developments and maintenance service schedules. Importantly, ASRL also proposes to extend its role of computer support to managing a major portion of the magazines editorial content and development. This will include oversight and management of contract and freelance contributions to the general website from; core content and editorial staff, stringer writers, and project evaluator. It will also build and support new interactive social media platforms such as blogs, quizzes, and more. ASRL has the past proven experience and known leadership skills to manage the necessary complexities of interface between technical and content personnel including; programmers, web designers, staff writers, free-lance writers, and manager for technical content. It is rare for an organization to have the content, web and software development and management capabilities all rolled into one.

The vision of delivering solar power to Earth from platforms in space has been known for decades. However, early SPS architectures were technically complex and unlikely to prove economically viable. There were several reasons: low technology maturity; excessive mass, due in part to the need for huge, high-voltage power management and distribution; the cost of developing a monolithic SPS much larger than the International Space Station (ISS); the need for 100s of astronauts and 1000s of robots for SPS construction in space factories at various orbits, and others. Some of these early issues, particularly regarding technical feasibility, were addressed by NASA's space solar power (SSP) studies and technology research in the mid-to-late 1990s. However, ten years ago a number of key technical and economic uncertainties remained. The concept proposed here - SPS-ALPHA - is fundamentally different from both current satellites and past SPS concepts in several critical ways. SPS-ALPHA is a biologically inspired concept: in a manner analogous to a hive of bees, a large number of individual modules (each individually intelligent"") will physically assemble to form a single enormous satellite. It involves several system segments: (1) an approximately one kilometer diameter RF aperture composed of tens of 1,000s of modular elements (none more than150 kg in mass), each incorporating locally powered and controlled WPT elements; (2) a large, non-rotating structural framework connected to the WPT array; and, (3) numerous autonomously pointing thin-film reflectors, attached to the structural framework, which redirect and concentrate incoming sunlight onto the RF aperture. To deliver energy to Earth, SPS-ALPHA would typically be based in a geostationary Earth orbit (GEO), where it would intercept sunlight using an collection of individual thin-film mirrors, convert that sunlight across a large RF aperture into a coherent microwave beam and transmit it to targets on Earth. SPS-ALPHA might also be based in Earth orbit, or elsewhere, such as at Earth-Moon Libration points, Lunar orbit, Sun-Earth Libration points, Mars orbit, and would deliver abundant and affordable solar power to markets on Earth or to enable ambitious new missions of space exploration and development. This project will establish the technical and economic viability of the SPS-ALPHA concept to an early TRL 3 ""analytical proof-of-concept"" and provide a framework for further study and technology development. The objectives of this innovative advanced concept project are to: (1) conduct an initial end-to-end systems analysis of the SPS-ALPHA concept in order to determine its technical feasibility; (2) identify and assess in greater detail the key technology challenges inherent in the architecture (including figures of merit for each critical technology area); (3) conduct an initial evaluation of the economic viability of the concept (as a function of key performance parameters); and, (4) define a preliminary roadmap for the further research and development of the SPS-ALPHA concept.""",,,,,,,,,

This project is of significance to the planetary atmospheres program because it addresses one of the most important questions in Martian (climate) science: how is the abundance of water on Mars controlled?

The project has three parts - to study: 1. the circulation in the middle atmosphere, specifically the mechanisms that produce the observed thermal and wind structure, including dependence on angular momentum conservation and radiative-dynamical feedbacks involving haze particles; 2. the near-surface circulation and the relationship of winds to observed Aeolian features; and, 3. the large-scale methane cycle, specifically the processes controlling evaporation and precipitation and the relationship to the distribution of surface fluvial features. All three components are fundamentally linked by the general circulation. The project will take advantage of the Titan Weather Research and Forecasting model, developed jointly via prior OPR funding, the NASA AISR program, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. A major thrust of this project will be the use of new data constraints from Cassini, the most striking of which are RADAR observations of features interpreted to be dunes and fluvial landforms. Analysis of data with prognostic numerical models, using simplified conceptual models to interpret both the data and modeling, are key to quantitative progress in understanding the atmospheric circulation on Titan. Titan is a highly significant object in the solar system because it is one of the few terrestrial bodies to possess an active climate system, of which the circulation and methane cycles"" are critically important components. By studying this system, the proposed project addresses NASA strategic goal 3C (advance scientific knowledge of the solar system), and addresses the objectives of the OPR program by enhancing the scientific return from (primarily) the Cassini mission, improving our understanding of how Titan has evolved over time, and defining dynamical processes operating within Titan's atmosphere.""",,,,,,,,,

We will use theories of dune formation to predict bedform orientations based on modeled winds at different resolutions, dust loadings and orbital configurations, and compare these and other predicted dune properties with observations of active and inactive dune fields on Mars.  Dunes haves been observed on Mars since the Mariner 9 mission in the early 1970s. In the last few years, high-resolution imaging by instruments such as THEMIS and HiRISE have provided unprecendented detail of dunes and dunefields. As dunes are aeolian (wind-driven) features, they provide a means to access the near-surface circulation, which has only been measured at a handful of locations on Mars, and for a complete annual cycle at only two locations (the Viking Lander 1 and 2 sites). The mere existence of dunes implies winds that are strong enough to transport sediment, their morphology (the dune type) indicates the directional variability of the wind regime, and their orientations provide information about the long-term wind direction. The bedform orientation of most dune types does not uniquely imply the dominant or average wind direction, however we will use an approach that is novel for Mars and will predict dune orientations given our modeled long-term wind field, using the gross bedform-normal transport (GBNT) approach of Rubin and Hunter [1987]. By comparing predicted and observed orientation, we can thus assess the validity of our model winds. We will use global and mesoscale numerical models of the Martian atmosphere, for a range of dust loadings during the storm season, and for a range of orbital configurations, to produce predictions of sand flux, DCA and dune orientations (applying the GBNT approach to the annual cycle of wind data) for the entire planet at low resolution and for four selected study regions at high resolution.  These will be compared to observations of respectively dune locations, DCA and slipface orientations (or other measures of dune orientation). If they agree, we can have more confidence in the validity of our modeled wind field for present day Mars. Given the important role of local scale topography we expect disagreement in many regions when using only the global model, and will use the mesoscale model to assess whether a finer resolution allows us to capture the dune-forming flows. Another reason for disagreement would be an incorrect choice of saltation threshold, and by tuning this to better match the observations we will obtain estimates of the saltation threshold on Mars itself. A third reason would be a strong dependence of the dune-forming winds on dust loading during the storm season, so we will also produce results for different dust storm conditions. A fourth reason would be a strong dependence of the dune-forming winds on Mars's orbital configuration, particularly with dunes judged to be inactive in the present wind regime, so we will also produce results for different obliquities and timing of perihelion. By performing the proposed work we will thus (1) produce estimates of the saltation threshold on Mars, (2) examine the importance of using the gross bedform-normal transport (GBNT) approach over a full annual cycle to predict dune orientations, and compare this with the previous method of inferring dominant winds based on certain dune morphologies and bedform orientations, (3) assess the validity of our modeled wind fields on global and regional scales, and (4) examine the impact of changes in (a) dust loading and (b) Mars's orbital configuration on the dune-forming circulation.  This proposal addresses NASA Strategic Goal 3, specifically, 3C. The proposal is highly relevant to the MFRP program, as by investigating the coupled atmospheric and geological systems on Mars we will address Mars Exploration Program goals 2A, 2B and 3A.",,,,,,,,,

The ability of models to reproduce the superrotation observed in Titan's atmosphere has been the center of some controversy with the modeling community as early good predictions of the circulation by the LMD model (a model which is no longer available) were found not to be reproducible by any later model. Most recently, our TitanWRF model has been proven able to reproduce the superrotation and it was found that very low diffusivity within the dynamical core (numerical or imposed) was the crucial factor. A functioning model of the observed superrotation finally opens up the possibility of exploring the mechanisms behind both the superrotation and the atmospheric circulation in general. Titan is an interesting member of the terrestrial atmospheres"" set (Venus, Earth, Mars, and Titan) since it is in the ""slow rotation"" regime along with Venus, but is forced with a seasonal cycle of Earth and Mars-like extremes.  We propose a comprehensive study of the circulation, with a specific focus on momentum and energy transport mechanisms.  The observation of clouds, apparently rain / runoff carved channels, and lakes makes methane a central issue for Titan. Lacking oceans, Titan's ""hydrological"" cycle is composed of transports between the subsurface, lakes, and the atmosphere - involving all three phases of methane. Several models have now been used to assemble a basic picture of the methane cycle, involving drying of the tropics, rainfall in association with a near pole-to-pole sweep of the ITCZ, and a bias in the surface stability of liquid methane that appears similar in both sense and mechanism to the stability of surface water ice on Mars. Currently, only simplified 3D models have been used to examine the methane cycle on Titan - here we propose to bring a full General Circulation Model (GCM) to bear on the problem.  In this project, we propose to use GCM modeling to address problems in the Titan atmosphere and climate system. The models are  based on two open source codes: the NCAR WRF and the MITGCM.  The proposed work is relevant to the OPR program through its study of Titan's atmosphere and climate system - a significant target of study for Cassini and the sole target of the Huygens missions. As a complex body with a rare ""Earth-like"" atmosphere and climate system, Titan is an especially important focus for attention within outer planets research.

The purpose of the support is to convene interdisciplinary meetings in global environmental change and Earth systems science each summer, to report back to NASA and other supporting agencies, and to seek publication of the findings of the sessions in scientific journals or other outlets. Conceived in 1989 and conducted each year since 1990, the AGCI summer meetings are designed to further knowledge in global change science by convening interdisciplinary scholars with the coordination and direction of session chairs, to focus on specific topics in the social and natural sciences (see section 4.2 and  ww.agci.org/meetings.html). These meetings consistently fill a unique niche by fostering a strong dialogue across the disciplines and often between the social and natural sciences. The session themes are selected to reflect research priorities as expressed by individual federal agencies and broadly as outlined each year in the United States Climate Change Science Program's five goals and linked set of research focus areas described in Our Changing Plane 2007 and generally in the CCSP Strategic Plan. AGCI topic selections also reflect the ongoing activities of the International Panel on Climate Change and the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme research areas of interest. The generation of potential session topics by participants each summer are reviewed by AGel's Science Advisory Board for consideration based on their ability to further global change science and the contribution this can make to society. The support requested is to provide the necessary resources to plan, conduct, document and report on two week long meetings each year beginning in 2007 and concluding in 2009. Approximately 57 scientists will participate for a total of 342 participant days in 2007 and 54 scientists for a total of 648 participant days in the years 2008 and 2009 for a total of 990 participant days. It is anticipated that each session will include international participants (past sessions average about 17 percent). In addition to the enrichment received by each participant regarding topics within their field, they are exposed to new information, often from outside their discipline. Taking advantage of the longer than usual format for a scientific meeting, participants have the opportunity to engage in extended and meaningful dialogue and follow-up with newfound colleagues in greater depth than is often the case in shorter duration meetings. One significant outcome of this approach is that research collaborations are spawned across disciplines that may not have occurred otherwise. Based on statements made by participants concerning the value of this type of meeting, a key element is that they are stimulated to? bring fresh approaches to their own research based on new insights developed at the AGCI summer meetings. Research recommendations that are developed at the meetings also playa role in the generation of research priorities at the agency level. As part of each interdisciplinary summer session one of the participants is asked to give the Walter Orr Roberts Memorial Public Lecture providing an education and public outreach opportunity aimed at a general audience on current topics in global environmental change. These lectures are broadcast on the local television station and videos are made available to the public. It is the intention of AGCI to continue seeking support for the summer meetings from agencies in addition to NASA and from the private sector and international sources. To date, complimentary support for the NASA sponsored meetings has come from the EPA, NSF, NOAA, USDA/FS, DOE and interagency support of the Sub-committee on Global Change Research, the United Nations En",,,,,,,,,
