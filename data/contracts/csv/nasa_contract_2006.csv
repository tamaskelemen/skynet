In Phase I, we will develop a prototype of a non-von-Neumann linear equation solver equipped with our technology, and demonstrate an intermediate milestone for its operational speedup and performance gains using at least two of the CFD problems in the NAS benchmark. Phase I will also deliver a clear technology roadmap in terms of algorithmic and architectural innovations needed to bring the project to success by the end of Phase II.  Four mission-critical areas to the success of an FPGA-based non-von-Neuman system within a von-Neumann-based supercomputing environment are identified, namely (1) portability; (2) ease of use; (3) algorithmic speed balance between von-Neumann and non-von-Neumann components; and (4) communication speed. Innovative architectural and algorithmic methods aimed at boosting system effectiveness through each one of the four areas are proposed. In particular, we propose the use of portability wrappers to enable wide portability at both hardware and software levels, software drivers in the form of an API for ease of use from a C and/or Fortran environment, innovative reconfigurable computing algorithms and bit structure optimizations suited to the LU factorization problem for speed, and a novel algorithmic technique within the reconfigurable computing paradigm that effectively eliminates the communication bottleneck, typical of multi-system distributed algorithms, for the LU factorization problem. The performance attainable with a single FPGA will be comparable to that of a 1,000-node commodity cluster, while exhibiting reductions of one to two orders of magnitude in both cost and power consumption."

This proposal will apply Ajax technology to the challenge of viewing large and scientifically useful images on the web.  The image algorithm suite we will develop will provide us the ability to view the solar disk and the inner heliosphere, labeled with feature recognition data products.  It will also provide the ability to tailor image viewer web applications to particular scientific goals of relevance to the LWS program.    Recent developments in web-based technologies have brought significant innovation to commercial websites.  The website http://maps.google.com (GoogleTM Maps) is a landmark application of these recent developments and an example of a new approach to web-based technologies known as Ajax.  The software driving GoogleTM Maps allows users to pan, scan and zoom at will over an apparent single enormous image of the Earth in a natural and intuitively appealing way.  We propose to apply Ajax technology to Living With a Star (LWS) applications by creating a suite of image retrieval, processing, display and storage algorithms that will implement the functionality required to be able to view and monitor features on the Sun and inner heliosphere simultaneously.  This suite of algorithms will be the engine that will power new and natural ways of visualizing the Sun and the inner heliosphere for the LWS program.  The technology that will be developed on completion of this proposal will provide an enabling capability for many disciplines to make their large images available easily on the web, and therefore satisfies the cross-disciplinary objective of the LWS program.  We propose an SDO image viewer to overlay different combinations of SDO data products with ancillary data.  The overlaid image tiles will be created on-the-fly, as preprocessing every possible combination of SDO image data would be far too costly in server resources.  Once created however, the images will be stored for future fast retrieval."""

Proposed Effort: From studies it has become obvious that the key enablers for future groundbreaking progress in GA are not only increased affordability but also other critical requirements such as improved performance and fuel efficiency; improved safety; ease of operation; drastic reduction of noise; acceptable performance specification. The design and development of new GA aircraft, with novel technologies for addressing these issues, represents a daunting challenge because of the scope of the radical design constraints due to the requirements of ease of manufacturing and maintenance, noise control, drastically improved safety, and efficiency. The proposed development of a scientifically based tool box for scaled model research, once validated for a typical GA aircraft such as the Cirrus SR22 with a relatively large scale model, will allow for drastically more cost-effective investigations of future GA aircraft concepts and will also considerably reduce the cost associated with the development and testing of novel technologies for GA . Specific key innovations associated with the proposed approach are; model as low-cost test-bed for future GA concept and technology development. Due to the relatively large scale to the validation model, chances are high that aerodynamic, dynamic and aeroelastic testing of critical design parts of new GA concepts can be accomplished with satisfactory fidelity.; Large empty shell composite structure and modular design to allow for flexible placement of flight hardware and adjustment of moments o inertia; Use of state-of-the-art prediction and simulation tools as well as wind/water tunnel experiments in design and data evaluation of dynamically scaled model research. The cost associated with the development of new aircraft, and especially with the testing required for FAA approval of new aircraft and aircraft technologies, is very high and hinders and/or stalls efforts by GA-companies to bring new advanced aircraft or advanced aircraft technologies to the market. Any effort of implementing novel technologies is financially risky and suffocates whatever healthy initiative and innovative ideas exist in the aviation industry."

Several optical systems, lasers, and detectors require tight temperature control to better than +/-1K. Some new missions even desire temperature control and thermal gradient control to the milli-Kelvin level. Typically precision temperature control is achieved by cold biasing the device and using electrical trim heaters. Variable conductance heat pipes are also used; however, the control band is not precise enough without unusually large reservoir volumes. The pressure controlled heat pipe has the potential to achieve precise temperature control without energy wasting control heaters and without unfavorable mass and volume reservoirs. PCHPs are essentially actively controlled VCHPs. In a PCHP, the control system senses an increase (or decrease) in pressure and actively changes either the gas charge in the reservoir or the volume of the reservoir to maintain the operating temperature precisely at the set point. The Phase I program will prove the feasibility of the PCHP concept. A prototype heat pipe will be built and tested. In Phase II, the integration and implementation of various control strategies will be performed."

The tool set can be applied to conventional vehicle types as well as hypersonic vehicles. The major issues involved in ASTE-P modeling and simulation will be significantly and extensively investigated in this project, which include full coupling between fluid/structure/control dynamics, the aeroservothermoelastic-propulsive instability, the viscous/turbulent effects, shock and shock-boundary layer interaction, as well as the large unsteady and highly nonlinear aerothermal dynamic loading on structure of vehicles. The interface of the structure/control surface dynamic vibration modes with flows will be modeled using particle-based material point method (MPM) in an integrated dynamic fluid-structure interaction environment. The MPM is essentially a particle-based method which avoids dealing with the time-varying mesh distortions and boundary variations due to structure/control surface deformations and/or motions (i.e. wing flutters, FCS/structural mode interaction, PSD turbulence response), thus being significantly more robust and computationally efficient than the traditional finite element methods that must utilize moving-boundary and mesh-regeneration. Phase I will build and demonstrate the initial capability; the end software in Phase II will be fully capable of ASTE-P analysis and evaluation for aerospace vehicles."

High pressure helium is commonly used to pressurize propellant fuel tanks. Helium cryocoolers can be used to sub-cool and thereby densify cryogenic propellants such as liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LO2). The use of densified cryogenic propellants can reduce the gross payload weight of a launch vehicle by up to 20%, or increase payload capability. Helium compressors are critical components for cryogenic propellant storage and distribution systems, whether used in cryocoolers for densification or to compress gaseous helium for propellant pressurization. Regenerative compressor technology can serve high head, low flow helium pressurization applications in a compact form with high reliability. Pressure ratios on the order of 3:1 per impeller-stage are commercially available. Non-lubricated gas-bearing supported prototypes have been successfully demonstrated. However, even state-of-the-art prototype regenerative compressors are limited to efficiencies of about 55%. This was achieved using aerodynamic rotor blades rather than the straight radial blades previously used. Commercially available regenerative compressors with straight vaned rotors operate at much lower efficiency. An innovation is proposed that promises to improve the efficiency of regenerative compressors well beyond the current state of the art."

AdvR, Inc will develop a fiber coupled, high power, electro-optically controlled, phase modulator for the NASA Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The device should be capable of phase modulating a 1 W or greater, continuous wave optical signal at multi-gigahertz rates at 1064 nm. The key innovation is the use of a waveguide embedded in a non-linear optical material suitable for high optical power handling. The phase modulators used for LISA must be rugged and must perform optimally in a radiation environment over the mission lifetime. To achieve this goal, the phase modulator development will include a fiber-in-fiber-out design that will readily lend itself to future space qualification for mechanical stability of the package and radiation damage resistance of the non-linear optical material. The Phase I effort successfully established the feasibility of the waveguide approach by achieving high power in a waveguide, modulating the waveguide, and performing preliminary radiation testing of the material. During the Phase II effort, three essential issues will be addressed. These issues are long term optical performance of the chosen substrate, traveling wave electrode design for efficient modulation, and the development of a packaging platform suitable for future space qualification. The high power, fiber coupled phase modulator enables the creation of a device that is not commercially available. There are several NASA applications that will benefit from this technology development. The modulator will find uses in high power lasers systems to provide sidebands onto a carrier signal and lidar systems which utilize high power fiber amplifiers. An additional application is a visible light modulator for locking a laser wavelength to a gas absorption reference. The high optical power capability of the phase modulator provides the primary basis for AdvR to enter the commercial market with this product. The fiber coupled phase modulator provides an alternative to currently available free space coupled phase modulators that can handle similar optical powers, but are bulky and require high drive voltage to operate. Additionally, the fiber coupled modulator is capable of handling significantly higher optical powers than commercially available fiber coupled lithium niobate waveguide phase modulators."

An adequate system must employ a high-speed, extra low power, linear, analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with high input bandwidth and accuracy, followed by a digital signal processor that is usually implemented inside a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Commercially available ADCs with input bandwidths larger than 1GHz feature high power consumption and latency, and poor linearity. With increasing ADC sampling rates, timing difficulties within the parallel interconnects between the ADC and the following FPGA become increasingly prominent. Therefore, a monolithic ADC incorporating a data converter that performs digital data demultiplexation and retiming is desired. To address these needs, the Advanced Science and Novel Technology Company proposes to develop a novel, extra low-power, extremely linear, under-sampling ADC featuring a high analog input bandwidth (>5GHz) that can easily interface to a following FPGA through a low-speed (<750Mb/s) parallel interface. To achieve this functionality, the proposed system-on-chip will utilize a proprietary sub-Nyquist front-end analog demultiplexer, a combinational ADC structure with proprietary gain-stabilization circuitry, and a digital signal processor implementing digital data demultiplexation and the company's proprietary data alignment scheme."

The systems must be easily upgradeable, power-efficient, fault-tolerant, EMI-protected, and capable to operate effectively for long periods of time in harsh environmental conditions including radiation effects. To address the described needs, Advanced Science and Novel Technology Company proposes to develop a basic concept of the novel, optical, radiation-tolerant transponder, which will be implemented as a hermetically-sealed pigtailed multi-chip module with an FPGA-friendly parallel interface and will feature an improved radiation tolerance, high data rate, low power consumption, and advanced functionality. The transponder will utilize the company's patent-pending current-mode logic library of radiation-hardened-by-architecture cells. 8B10B encoding will be used to achieve data disparity equal to 0 and perform a reliable clock recovery. The encoder and decoder will utilize the company's patented half-rate architecture that improves radiation tolerance. The proposed characteristics will be achieved by utilization of an advanced SiGe BiCMOS technology."

SLATE will support incremental computation of guarantees and the assumptions required, vastly simplifying the reconfiguration, upgrading, or retargeting of autonomous control systems. Phase I will provide a feasibility demonstration and evaluation of SLATE's representation and inference through application to a multi-level robotic control system, and identify the key features needed in an application-ready version of SLATE.

The phase modulators used for LISA must be rugged and must perform optimally in a radiation environment over the mission lifetime. To achieve this goal, the phase modulator development will include a fiber-in-fiber-out design that will readily lend itself to future space qualification for mechanical stability of the package and radiation damage resistance of the non-linear optical material. The Phase I effort successfully established the feasibility of the waveguide approach by achieving high power in a waveguide, modulating the waveguide, and performing preliminary radiation testing of the material. During the Phase II effort, three essential issues will be addressed. These issues are long term optical performance of the chosen substrate, traveling wave electrode design for efficient modulation, and the development of a packaging platform suitable for future space qualification. The high power, fiber coupled phase modulator enables the creation of a device that is not commercially available. There are several NASA applications that will benefit from this technology development. The modulator will find uses in high power lasers systems to provide sidebands onto a carrier signal and lidar systems which utilize high power fiber amplifiers. An additional application is a visible light modulator for locking a laser wavelength to a gas absorption reference. The high optical power capability of the phase modulator provides the primary basis for AdvR to enter the commercial market with this product. The fiber coupled phase modulator provides an alternative to currently available free space coupled phase modulators that can handle similar optical powers, but are bulky and require high drive voltage to operate. Additionally, the fiber coupled modulator is capable of handling significantly higher optical powers than commercially available fiber coupled lithium niobate waveguide phase modulators."

The key innovation in this effort is the use of large diameter, optical quality, z-cut SLT, which has only recently become commercially available, as the waveguide substrate material. Relative to the standard congruently grown lithium tantalate wafers, stoichiometric lithium tantalate wafers have significantly higher optical damage thresholds, stronger nonlinear and electro-optic response, an expanded transparency window and significantly reduced poling field. Furthermore, because the stoichiometric materials are not lithium deficient, the fabricated waveguides are expected to be optically stable. During the Phase I effort the feasibility of fabricating waveguides in z-cut SLT wafers using annealed proton exchange will be determined, and the impact that variations in processing conditions have on the optical properties will be measured. In the Phase II effort, the waveguide fabrication and poling technology will be refined and grating structures suitable for specific NASA applications requiring wavelength conversion."

It is not enough to depend on the excitement generated by NASA images. NASA must use discoveries and achievements to engage students and the education community. NASA provides meaningful, educational, and content-rich programs to inspire students at all levels to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). NASA Education partners with academia, professional associations, industry, and other agencies to provide teachers and faculty with experiences that capitalize on the excitement of NASA's missions. Education Programs provide opportunities for involvement in NASA's research efforts to encourage students to pursue higher education in STEM areas. To ensure a pipeline of highly trained people prepared to meet mission requirements within NASA, as well as in industry and academia, NASA must: motivate students to pursue careers in STEM areas; provide educators with unique teaching tools and compelling teaching experiences; ensure that public resources are invested wisely; and fully engage minority and underrepresented students, educators, and researchers in NASA's education programs. The Office of Education strives to reach youth with whom to connect, excite, and inspire the next generation of scientists, inventors, technicians, and explorers."

The research and technology development effort is directed at important trace gases of interest to NASA, including carbon monoxide, ammonia, alcohols and formaldehyde. The goal is low temperature catalytic oxidation and regenerative adsorption, both of which are of high interest. The proposed system is regenerable and expected to have lower equivalent systems mass and improved performance to conventional (activated carbon) systems. Outside of NASA markets include applications for residential and industrial air filtration, pollutions abatement, homeland security and military. The proposed alternative methods for scale-up of the mesh materials have potential for substantially reducing the cost over the initial concept evaluated during the phase I activity. The proposal focuses on an area of high relevance to NASA Constellation Program: spacecraft cabin trace contaminant control. The approach is very novel and involves a CNT covered stainless steel mesh integrated of functionalized with materials to improve its catalytic oxidation properties (for removal of carbon monoxide, alcohols and formaldehyde) and adsorptive properties (for removal of ammonia). The proposed technology exploits the physical properties of CNTs with respect to high electrical and thermal conductivity and surface area to volume ratio. The small business and research institution provides complementary experience and facilities, although neither include specific expertise in atmospheric trace contaminant control. The Phase II effort includes risk in the area of ammonia adsorption, which had less emphasis during Phase I. The survey and discussion of literature could have been improved if it included content on state of the art trace contaminant control systems, atmospheric requirements including spacecraft maximum allowable concentrations (SMAC) of trace gases, and ammonia adsorption."

The hardware on the space suit was- and still is- fabricated and designed by Air-Lock, Inc.; the soft goods were a product of ILC Dover. Over the past 20 years, the uses for the MK-III space suit technology demonstrator have been quite varied. Most recently the suit has been serving in comparative space suit testing with other styles of prototype space suits and current flight program space suit configurations. The comparative analysis allows engineers to put quantitative values to the subjective data that has been collected with respect to suit mobility. Test data is being used by the Exploration Program to develop requirements for lunar surface extra vehicular activity tasks. Functional mobility range of motion testing has included the following activities: walking, crawling, kneeling, ascending and descending a ladder, translating up and down an inclined surface, shoveling, hammering, ingressing and egressing seats, and the operation of multiple hatch actuation concepts. Further the MK-III, has been utilized on the reduced gravity aircraft for interface feasibility testing with the Constellation Program Orion vehicle side hatch, the low impact docking system tunnel, and micro-gravity space suit don and doff testing. The MK-III space suit technology demonstrator also serves as the primary suit for the Desert Research and Technology Studies conducted each year in Arizona. The Desert Research and Technology Studies activities center around the development and testing of hardware and mission operations anticipated for future planetary exploration programs. Most notably, the MK-III space suit technology demonstrator has be used to study the interfaces between a suited subject and the Science, Crew, Operations and Utility Test bed (SCOUT), which is a combination planetary roving vehicle and robotic assistant. The interfaces studied include the suit to seat interface, the suit to displays interface, and the suit to controls interface."

With the support of NASA's SARA and APRA programs, over the past four years we have made substantial progress in this work. Our work has focused on calculations of 1) ielectronic recombination (DR), 2) fluorescence and Auger yields due to a Is vacancy, and 3) inner-shell photoabsorption. DR is the dominant electron-ion recombination for most ions in cosmic plasmas. Recently our group has completed calculations of DR for the H-like through Na-like isoelectronic series for elements up through Zn, Our theoretical calculations are in good agreement with existing high-resolution storage ring measurements for Fe ions. Accurate fluorescence yield and Auger yield data due to Is vacancies are needed for modeling shocked gas in supernova remnants and X-ray photoionized plasmas. We have completed calculations for the entire second row of isoelectronic series for elements up through Zn, Our results have revealed large errors in the fluorescence/Auger database currently being used by the astrophysicists, and we have elucidated the higher-order effects that are necessary for the proper description of these atomic processes. Accurate photoabsorption cross sections are also required to model properly X-ray photoionizaed plasmas. We have completed calculations for the the photoabsorption of all oxygen and neon ions and have included these data into the modeling of abundances in the ISM and opacities in accretion disks. Unlike existing independent-particle data, our method is ideally suited for modeling the observed X-ray absorption features by also including resonance excitation, Auger broadening, and relaxation effects. We propose to continue our DR, fluorescence, and photoabsorption work. We will extend our DR work to calculate rate coefficients for isoelectronic sequences of the more complicated third row elements. We will also continue calculating new Auger/fluorescence data. In specific, we will investigate lsuelectronic sequences for which multiple electrons and/or photons can be emitted. We will continue research along the lines of inner shell photoabsorption for all ions of carbon, magnesium, silicon and sulfur, working in close collaboration with X-ray modeler colleagues. All of our new atomic data will be made publicly available and will be used by us in the non-equilibrium plasma simulation code CLOUDY to enable more accurate interpretations of ionized mission/absorption line gas. Our work will be relevant to the interpretation of spectroscopic data from a range of past, present, and future satellite observatories including WE, HST, EUVE, ISO, HUT, ORFEUS, Einstein, EXOSAT, ROSAT, ASCA, FUSE, GALEX, NGST, Chandra, XMM, JWST, SIRTF, ASTRO-E2, and Constellation-X."

The collaboration is a facet of the Education and Public Outreach (EPO) efforts associated with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Mission and the Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND) experiment. The program provides a set of internships for students and fellowships for faculty, sustained over the timeline of the LEND project, with the goal of producing active research groups in the field of space science at the selected campuses. Undergraduates (to be known as NASA/LEND Scholars) at participating institutions will engage in summer internships at GSFC for the duration of the LEND project (2006-09), while their faculty mentors (to be known as LEND Fellows) will visit GSFC for several weeks to famiUarize them with the project and data. One institution selected to participate will also be part of MU-SPIN's Network Resource and Training Site program (NRTS). The students and faculty will work directly with NASA scientists active in the LEND project in the summer, and continue the project when the summer is over. The program is sustained during the academic year by a variety of mechanisms which may include: funding for student research stipends, a new course (or courses) or seminar series in tmdergraduate research developed by the faculty mentor, and travel to appropriate conferences and launch events by student and faculty. As the faculty member gains familiarity and expertise with the science of the mission, she/he then will take on a larger role in the mentorship process, which is another critical ingredient to sustaining the benefits of the program beyond a mere summer internship. The intent is to involve the LEND scholars in the research endeavor until they graduate, and to engage the institution, the SPS chapter and the LEND Fellows in the research process until the mission is completed in 2009."

AMS promotes the development and dissemination of information on the atmospheric and related Earth system sciences. Founded in 1919, it has a membership of approximately 12,000 professionals, professors, students, and weather enthusiasts. The AMS has active programs in education, public outreach, and public policy.  The goal of this project is to build U.S. capacity for the conduct of Earth systems science but especially the translation of that science into societal benefits. The APP, NASA and other collaborators will work together to achieve this goal. We are proposing a multi-year, multi-stage effort that will address this issue from several perspectives. One perspective will be to develop a dedicated activity in this area. Secondly, the APP plans to address the issue in many of our ongoing activities including the Environmental Science Seminar Series, the Summer Policy Colloquium, the Policy Study Series, and the Policy Research Symposium at the AMS annual meeting. The APP has begun discussions with other federal agencies, research institutions, and other interested parties who are interested in partnering on this activity."

DISK MIDPLANES CAN REACH SUCH LOW IONIZATION FRACTIONS THAT THE GAS NO LONGER COUPLES TO THE MAGNETIC FIELD, PRODUCING A DEAD ZONE WITH NO TURBULENCE THERE, SURROUNDED BY ACTIVE LAYERS ABOVE AND BELOW. TURBULENT DENSITY FLUCTUATIONS IN DISKS PRODUCE FLUCTUATIONS IN GRAVITATIONAL FORCE THAT CAN STRONGLY AFFECT THE MIGRATION OF TERRESTRIAL MASS PLANETS. NUMERICAL MODELS OF THIS PROCESS CAN ONLY BE RUN FOR HUNDREDS OF ORBITS, A SMALL FRACTION OF THE OVERALL MIGRATION TIME. SEMI-ANALYTIC MODELS CAN CAPTURE THE GLOBAL MIGRATION BEHAVIOR, BUT REQUIRE NUMERICAL MODELS TO CALIBRATE THEIR PARAMETERS. WE PROPOSE TO USE EXTENSIVE NUMERICAL MODELING OF STRATIFIED DISKS BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT DEAD ZONES TO CONSTRAIN THE PARAMETERS OF A SEMI-ANALYTIC ADVECTION-DIFFUSION MODEL OF PLANETARY MIGRATION. WE WILL THEN USE THE CONSTRAINED MODEL TO PREDICT THE VARIETY OF PLANETARY SYSTEM ARCHITECTURES THAT CAN BE EXPECTED. THE WORK PROPOSED HERE WILL BROADEN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF PLANETARY SYSTEMS. THIS WILL HELP US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW OUR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM FORMED, AND WHY IT APPEARS TO DIFFER IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS FROM MOST EXOSOLAR PLANETARY SYSTEMS SO FAR OBSERVED. ULTIMATELY, THIS MAY HELP PREDICT THE FREQUENCY OF HABITABLE PLANETS AROUND OTHER STARS. THIS WORK WILL ADDRESS NASA STRATEGIC GOAL 3, SUB-GOALS 3C (ADVANCING SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM) AND 3D (DISCOVER THE ORIGIN OF...AND SEARCH FOR EARTH-LIKE PLANETS)."

With the birth of the space age, the opportunity for experimentation over the full spectrum of gravity-related phenomena finally became a reality. A new environment and research tools became available to probe biological phenomena and expand scientific knowledge. The American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology (ASGSB) was founded in 1984 and is an organization that fosters research, education, training and development in gravitational and space biology. Society members are drawn from university, govemment, and industry from here and abroad and represent many disciplines bonded by interest in a common issue, gravity. Each spring, the Society publishes an annual scientific publication that includes peerreviewed original articles including those derived from featured symposia presentations. The society also provides teacher aids covering topics of interest to gravitational and space biologists. These aids and other information describing the nature and activities of the ASGSB are available at www.asgsb.org."

CO2 measurements are of great importance to many areas of research, including climate change, global carbon budgets, and geological research in relation to volcanic activity. At the same time, we are entering a period of time in which Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) are becoming more widely used for atmospheric research. UAS platforms have already proven themselves as a uniquely capable means for making measurements in remote areas and over oceans. However, existing CO2 measurement technologies are difficult to adapt to or use in the UAS world. This proposal describes a simple and inexpensive sensor for the precise determination of atmospheric CO2 that will be small enough for flight on small UAS platforms and sounding balloons. Phase I will include the fabrication of a proof-of-concept sensor system, laboratory characterization of the sensor, and culminate in a demonstration of the sensor on a UAS. Phase II will emphasize improving the basic manufacturability of the design, as well as much more extensive laboratory and UAS testing."

ANDREWS SPACE, INC. PROPOSES AN INNOVATIVE TRANSPIRATION COOLED AEROBRAKE TPS DESIGN THAT IS THERMALLY PROTECTIVE, STRUCTURALLY FLEXIBLE, AND LIGHTWEIGHT. THIS INNOVATIVE DESIGN WILL ALSO MEET LAUNCH VOLUME CONSTRAINTS AND SATISFY TERMINAL AEROBRAKING REQUIREMENTS. THE APPROACH WILL FOCUS ON TRANSPIRATION COOLING OF A FLEXIBLE MATERIAL AND WILL CONSIDER ABLATIVE AND INSULATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AS KEY FEATURES OF THE TPS DESIGN. THE APPLICATION OF AEROBRAKING TO REDUCE VELOCITY FOR PLANETARY CAPTURE AND LANDING HAS LONG BEEN ASSUMED FOR USE ON MARS MISSIONS AND HAS BEEN SUGGESTED FOR EARTH REENTRY. THE MAJOR HURDLE TO INFLATABLE AEROBRAKES BECOMING REALITY IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LIGHTWEIGHT AND STRUCTURALLY FLEXIBLE THERMAL PROTECTION SYSTEM (TPS). BY COMBINING WELL UNDERSTOOD INSULATIVE AND ABLATIVE TPS WITH AN INNOVATIVE FLEXIBLE TRANSPIRATION COOLED TPS, A REALIZABLE INFLATABLE AEROBRAKE SYSTEM CAN BE DEVELOPED. THE PRIMARY CONCERN IN ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY IS SUFFICIENTLY PROTECTING THE PAYLOAD FROM EXTREME THERMAL LOADS. TO OPTIMIZE PACKING VOLUME DURING LAUNCH, THE MOST EFFICIENT OPTION IS TO CREATE A NON-RIGID STRUCTURE WHICH COULD BE STORED UNTIL ENTRY OCCURS. STRUCTURAL FLEXIBILITY OF THE TPS DETERMINES THE PACKAGING EFFICIENCY OF THE ENTIRE AEROBRAKE. ALTHOUGH THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN SEARCHING FOR A MATERIAL WHICH SATISFIES THESE REQUIREMENTS, NO LIGHTWEIGHT SOLUTION HAS PROVIDED EITHER ENOUGH RELIABILITY, ROBUSTNESS, OR AFFORDABILITY TO BE CARRIED TO PRODUCTION. IN PHASE I, ANDREWS SPACE HAS USED THE LATEST MATERIALS SCIENCE AND EXPLORED DESIGN OPTIONS TO DEVELOP A STRUCTURALLY FLEXIBLE THERMAL PROTECTION SYSTEM. ANDREWS SPACE PROPOSES TO COMBINE PRECERAMIC POLYMERS WITH ACTIVE FILLERS TO FORM AN INNOVATIVE COMBINATION OF HEAT SHIELDING TECHNOLOGIES WHOSE EMPHASIS RELIES ON TRANSPIRATIVE COOLING. WHILE MUCH RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE ON POTENTIAL INFLATABLE TPS MATERIALS, OUR CONCEPT FOCUSES ON TRANSPIRATION COOLING OF A THIN, MULTI-LAYER, HIGH TEMPERATURE, WOVEN MATERIAL EMBEDDED WITH THE PRECERAMIC POLYMERS AND ACTIVE FILLERS. PHASE I HAS EXPLORED A RANGE OF DESIGN OPTIONS, USING ANDREWS  INTEGRATED CONCEPTUAL DESIGN TOOLS AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING PROCESSES TO REFINE THE DESIGN APPROACH. PHASE II WILL PERFORM MATERIAL PROPERTIES TESTING OF SAMPLE COUPONS AT LOW AND HIGH HEATING RATES AT THE APPROPRIATE TESTING FACILITIES, INCLUDING AN ARC JET CENTER. "

Many NASA Space and Earth programs in the infrared range 1060 a?? 1550 nm are limited by the detector performance that require long exposure time due to their low sensitivity and/or high noise. Large format infrared photon counting arrays with ranging capability would provide a valuable tool to many space missions. Current state-of-the-art fabrication of photon counting infrared detector arrays on non-silicon semiconductors is not mature enough to monolithically integrate complex readout circuitry at pixel level and large format array multiplexing. APEAK will develop novel, fast readout, integrated circuits (ROIC) to be integrated with large photon-counting infrared detector arrays into 3D imaging cameras with photon-counting sensitivity. These new cameras will support NASA missions in applications such as space docking, landing, remote mapping, and robotic vision. The goal of this project is to develop smart-pixel ROIC arrays in silicon with enhanced radiation tolerance and ready for hybrid integration with large infrared photon-counting avalanche photodiode arrays that will enable large-area detectors with short integration time, sub-nanosecond timing resolution, and on-pixel logic. The simulation, implementation and validation of all the blocks of a ROIC array specifically developed for operation with infrared photon-counting arrays In Phase II, APEAK will improve, fabricate and qualify ROIC arrays with integrated timing functions at pixel level and capable of integration in flip-chip technology with large infrared photon counting detector arrays. The potential NASA commercial applications are the following: free space optical communications, LADAR, LIDAR, planetary mapping, obstacle detection, 3D remote robotics, and docking. There are also potential non-NASA commercial applications. ROIC arrays could enhance the performance of hyperspectral imaging in medical and defense applications when interconnected to a large format detector arrays covering different spectral ranges. Specific biomedical applications include positron emission tomography (PET), laser correlation spectroscopy (LCS), single molecule detection and fast DNA sequencing. Military and security applications would include generic 3D imaging, hyperspectral imaging, laser ranging, night vision, surveillance, anti-collision devices, underwater imaging, and cargo imaging. In High-Energy and Nuclear Physics, these ROIC arrays could be used for high-resolution tracking and experiments using time-of-flight methods."

The evaluation of the velocities due to vortex and boundary elements, which constitute roughly 90% of the simulation cost, are accelerated via a scalably parallel adaptive fast multipole method (FMM) for distributed computing. The objective of this proposal is to incorporate hardware acceleration into the latter using a cluster of graphical processing units (GPU). During Phase I, the direct interaction component of FMM (vortex only), which constitutes roughly half the computational cost, will be offloaded onto one GPU. Feasibility will be demonstrated by achieving order-of-magnitude GPU speedup over a CPU. Phase II activities will involve the porting of the entire FMM code (for both vortex and boundary elements) onto a cluster of GPUs. The developed grid-free flow simulation software for GPU clusters is expected to provide significant price/performance improvement over traditional CPU clusters, thereby allowing simulations for larger and more physically realistic problems."

In order for these missions to achieve maximum scientific return, laboratory studies must be carried out to provide the necessary data base for astronomical investigations at these wavelengths. Because heterodyne instrumentation is a major component of these projects, knowledge of atomic and molecular transition frequencies are crucial for their success. One class of molecular line transitions that are unique to the sub-mmifar IR regions arise from diatomic metal hydride species, both the neutral (MH) and singly ionized (MH+) compounds. Because of their low moments of inertia, the pure rotational transitions of these molecules occur only at sub-mm wavelengths and into the infrared region. Therefore, they are extremely good targets for sub-mm and Terahertz NASA missions. Despite their obvious importance, transition frequencies for such species are either poorly known or non-existent. The purpose of this proposal is to continue to assemble a complete data base of highly accurate (1 part in lO(7)) rotational rest frequencies for metal hydride molecules of astrophysical interest. During the past grant period, the P.I. has been successful in the measurement of the pure rotational spectrum of several hydrides, both neutrals and ions, including AIH, CrH, and SH+. In the process, a new velocity modulation spectrometer system has been developed at sub-mm wavelengths that has been very successful in selectively detecting molecular ions. We propose to continue our hydride studies and investigate the neutral species SiH, FeH, TiH and MnH, as well as hydride ions such as MgH+, AlH+, SiH+, and NaH+. To date, there are no high resolution data available for any metal hydride ion outside of the P.I.'s measurements. Diatomic hydrides, both neutrals and ions, have long been considered to be building blocks of astrochemistry because they are the simplest of interstellar species. They also are thought to be present in many environments including diffuse gas, dense clouds and in shocked regions. Detection of the proposed metal hydrides will not only help complete the inventory of the cosmically abundant elements in molecular clouds, but also lead to a better evaluation of gas phase versus dust grain components of refractories. Indeed, these species may be the hidden"" carriers of the refractory elements in molecular gas and their existence could change the interpretation of the ionization state of both dense and diffuse interstellar material. In addition, examination of the hydrides in the ISM will lead to a better understanding of interstellar and circumstellar chemistry and could provide observational constraints for nucleosynthesis and dredge-up processes in late-type stars."""

Research in terrestrial settings has shown that clastic sedimentary deposits are productive host rocks for underground volatile reservoirs because of their high porosity and permeability. Sedimentary deposits on Mars are logical places to look for evidence of past or present volatile activity. Within such reservoirs, faults play an important role in directing volatile migration pathways, because faults act as either barriers or conduits. Faults are important volatile concentrators, which means that evidence of geochemical, hydrologic and biologic processes are likely concentrated at these locations. This project will analyze observations of the layered sedimentary deposits on Mars in order to generate comprehensive models and maps of paleo-subsurface, fault controlled hydraulic conductivity, as exposed at the surface today. This project builds upon recent advances in reservoir characterization and strategic background work in Mars data analysis. The PI has developed cutting-edge methodologies based on strain energy density criteria for characterizing fault-controlled pathways of volatile migration within terrestrial reservoirs. Numerical methods for characterizing fault displacement and fault plane geometries based on MOI. A topography have also been demonstrated by the ll In this proposal, these capabilities are integrated to produce an innovate approach that will extract paleo-subsurface, hydrogeologic information from existing Mars data. These methodologies remain robust through the natural range of geomaterial behavior, therefore approximate mechanical and chemical data for the layered deposits (from Ml K i will produce meaningful results. The resulting maps of fault-controlled hydraulic conductivity will have immediate implications for understanding past hydrogeologic environments on Mars and for identifying promising sites for future surface exploration. The goal of this project is consistent with the objectives of NASA's Strategic Plan to prepare for human exploration of Mars and beyond. The goal of this project is also directly in line with the objective of the Mars Data Analysis Program to enhance scientific return from the MGS, MO, and Ml K missions. The proposed work also supports MDAP's high-priority area of Mars research that focuses on the characterization of potential landing sites for future exploration missions. In this project, numerical methods that have already been developed and proven will be used to analyze I''DS-released Mars data. This project represents an innovative approach to integrating existing ground-and orbit-based data sets in order to enhance scientific understanding of geologic processes on Mars and to better characterize potential landing sites for future exploration."
