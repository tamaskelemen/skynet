HOWEVER, GOLDILOCKS ISN&#039;T SIMPLY ABOUT TEMPERATURE. IT&#039;S ABOUT PORRIDGE. WHAT KIND OF TELESCOPE CAN SENSE HOME COOKING WITHIN THE HABITABLE ZONES OF OUR STELLAR NEIGHBORHOOD? THE EXTRAORDINARY DEMANDS MADE BY EXOPLANET DISCOVERY INCLUDE TELESCOPE APERTURES OF UNPRECEDENTED ANGULAR RESOLUTION AND SENSITIVITY. HOWEVER, THAT BALLGAME CANNOT EVEN BEGIN WITHOUT A METHOD TO OCCLUDE OR NULL THE HOST STAR AND REMOVE ITS GLARE. AS IF THAT WERE NOT TROUBLE ENOUGH, HABITABLE PLANET DISCOVERY NECESSITATES EXQUISITE SPECTROGRAPHIC CAPABILITY. THE NECESSITY IS NOT LOST ON NASA. THE DECADAL SURVEY OF ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS MAKES IT QUITE CLEAR THAT EXOPLANET DISCOVERY MUST INCLUDE A SPECTROSCOPY COMPONENT. YET THERE ARE NO EXISTING HABITABLE PLANET ZONE FINDERS WITH SPECTROGRAPHS AND FEW ARE PLANNED. HOMES (HOLOGRAPHIC OPTICAL METHOD FOR EXOPLANET SPECTROSCOPY) IS A SPACE TELESCOPE DESIGNED TO HIT ALL OF THESE CRITERIA. ITS DOUBLE DISPERSION ARCHITECTURE EMPLOYS A HOLOGRAPHIC OPTICAL ELEMENT AS A PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IN CONJUNCTION WITH A NOVEL SECONDARY SPECTRAL INTERFEROMETER. UNLIKE MIRRORS AND LENSES, THE HOLOGRAMS ARE THIN AND FLAT. THEY CAN BE FABRICATED ON THIN GOSSAMER MEMBRANES AND STRETCHED OVER SPACE FRAMES COVERING THOUSANDS OF SQUARE METERS. THIS PROVIDES THE SCALE OF COLLECTOR NEEDED TO CAPTURE THE PHOTONS FROM VERY FAINT SOURCES LIKE EXOPLANETS AND BRING THEM TO A FOCUS. BECAUSE HOLOGRAPHIC OPTICS FOCUS BY THE PROCESS OF DISPERSION, THEY ARE INTRINSICALLY SPECTROGRAPHIC PROVIDING A WEALTH OF DETAIL ABOUT THE COMPOSITION OF THE IMAGES THEY FORM. ADD TO THIS A NOVEL NOTCH FILTER TO DIM THE STAR THAT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE SPECTROGRAPHIC IMAGE, AND HOMES IS A CONCEPT THAT ADDRESSES THE DEMANDING SPECIFICATIONS OF A TELESCOPE TO FIND HABITABLE PLANETS WITHIN 30 LIGHT YEARS OF EARTH."

TWO CONCEPTS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND WILL BE FURTHER RESEARCHED. THE FIRST DESIGN INCLUDES CO-MOLDING A BEARING RACE TO A CARBON FIBER REINFORCED COMPOSITE SHAFT. THE SECOND DESIGN INTEGRATES THE COMPOSITE SHAFT AND METALLIC GEAR IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS SHAFT MISALIGNMENT IN THE POWER TRANSMISSION SYSTEM. THESE ATTACHMENTS WILL SIMPLIFY GEAR ATTACHMENT AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE WEIGHT BY INTEGRATING PARTS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR SECONDARY FASTENERS. THIS DEVELOPMENT WORK WILL ALLOW FOR WIDESPREAD APPLICATION IN BOTH MILITARY AND CIVIL ROTORCRAFT SYSTEMS.

Main Thrust: Continue improvement of the fabrication as well as testing carbon based materials for applications in Space Propulsion, Power Generation as well as Thermal Shielding. In this work we will focus our efforts on the fabrication of GPC composites ware and measure the Mechanical properties, measure thermal conductivity, and other physical properties of the nanomaterials inclusion in the precursor of glassy polymeric carbon (GPC). During the second stage of this project, we will initiate a study of the keV and MeV irradiation of produced GPC composites, as well as testing the erosion resistance of the fabricated coupons in hot hydrogen environment by our colleagues at MSFC. We will introduce nanopowder of Multi-Walled Carbon Nano Tubes (MWNT), nanopowder of Alumina (Al2O3) and nanopowder of Silicon Carbide (Sic) in the precursor resin in order to produce the desire properties of such materials to operate in extreme environment of high radiation, hot hydrogen (500 C to 3000 C), and measure the thermal, electrical and mechanical properties of the GPC composite materials&compare such results with pure GPC. Consideration: High temperature hydrogen and radiation hardened systems: Investigate the effect of nano-materials mixing in the carbon based system (possible usage in the moderator, heterogeneous thermal reactors with separate fuel and moderator, as well as usage as TPS). The size of these reactors is dependent on the efficiency of heat transfer, and performance of these systems is a function of the maximum fuel temperature, which is limited to between 2300 K and 3500 K. Major design considerations include selection of materials to avoid hot corrosion with multiple reactor restarts, and fuel element fabrication to retain fission products."""

The program is a unique partnership between afterschool programs and science museums. - Out-of-school program: After-School Math PLUS (ASM+) - Sponsoring organization: Educational Equity Center at AED (EEC/AED) - Year program was established: Pilot-2003; National replication: 2006-2010 - Geographical locations: Pilot: New York, NY; St Louis, MO; Louisville, KY; National Replication: Huntsville, AL, Bangor, ME, Martinsville, VA; Albuquerque, NM; Stilwell, OK - Targeted participants: Students in grades 3-8 underserved in STEM  - Number of students served: Annually-l00-150; to-date-750-1000 - Student-to-staff ratio: 20: 1-2 - Program content theme: ASM+ incorporates math skills/concepts through four themes common to afterschool-Jump Rope Math (sports);The Built Environment (social justice), ArtMath and Music Math. - Program partners: ASM+ is a partnership between afterschool programs and science museums. Pilot partners were the New York Hall of Science/Chinese American Planning Council Program in New York; St. Louis Science Center/Adams School Community Center in St Louis, MO; and the Louisville Science Center/ Whitney Scholars program for 7th/Sth grade students in Louisville, KY. With funding from Toyota USA, ASM+ has been replicated at four sites: Maine Discovery CenterlIndian Island School Afterschool Program in Bangor, ME; the US Space & Rocket Center/University Place School in Huntsville, AL; the Louisville Science CenterlDevers Youth Center at Fort Knox in KY; and the Virginia Museum of Natural HistorylHenry County After 3 Collaborative in Martinsville, VA. ASM+ was further replicated with middle school American Indian students in Albuquerque, NM, and elementary students in Bangor, ME and Stilwell, OK. - Description of structure: In each ASM+ theme, students participate in a series of five hands-on activities at their afterschool program and, at a science museum, create an exhibit that displays the math ski1ls and content they have learned. An emphasis on careers and role models and a connection to literacy are integrated into each theme as are biographies of people who have chosen a related STEM career. The culminating event is a students exhibit at the science museum or a community site to which families are invited free of charge. For example: a. In Huntsville, 4th grade students from the University Place School worked with their in-school math teacher in an ASM+ afterschool math club. Students explored geometric patterns in the built environment of their center and the surrounding neighborhood. Then, they measured areas of their center and developed scaled blueprints of the dimensions. b. At the U.S. Space and Rocket Center, students used the skills they had gained to create a built-to-scale model of a Mars colony using found materials from NASA's space program. Students thought about what people would need to live on Mars. They built houses of worship (Church, Synagogue, and Mosque), a recreation center with gravitational pull in mind, and placed their buildings with regard to health and safety. The Mars Colony has become a permanent display at the Museum. One year later, the same students, now 5th graders were invited back to make a presentation. Their teacher, who thought he would need to refresh them about the work they had done, was pleasantly surprised to learn that they remembered all the math and every detail about building the Mars colony. c. In other ASM+ sites, students have built scale model charrettes of a tsunami-proof village, an accessible 2012 Olympic venue, an Indian village situated next to a river (Wabanaki Tribe) and a summer house (Cherokee Nation).

The samples, from the Moon, Mars, Earth and the asteroid Vesta (a possible dwarf planet) would be obtained as meteorites from reputable dealers and would be mounted under Lexan domes serving both to magnify the objects and prevent vandalism. Visitors could touch the samples with a bent finger. Simple text and graphic panels will explain how each of the featured worlds fits into the broader context of planetary formation. This exhibit will allow visitors an opportunity to make a physical connection to the other worlds of the Solar System. This direct connection is particularly timely given the upcoming Dawn arrival at Vesta, the planned return to the Moon, and ongoing Mars exploration. To enhance the experience, the Adler would produce short interactive video segments that highlight how these samples came to be on the Earth, what their history and context was on their world of origin and the human story of how they came to be found and recognized as originating on another world. Scientists from the Planetary Science Institute would serve as both consulting experts and on-camera talent for the video segments and text/graphics panels. The exhibit elements would be designed to be modular and expandable. Once the basic template (mount and graphic panel design, video system details, video script outline and style elements etc.) was completed the exhibit would be easy to expand to include other samples. Particularly intriguing possibilities include possible Mercurian meteorites, if these are confirmed, as well as samples of other asteroid types. Because the exhibit will be functional as a stand-alone exhibit rather than just a supplement to other exhibits, it will be well suited to replication by small planetaria and science museums. The cost for each copy will be limited to actual materials and labor associated with construction, approximately 4000 - 5000 dollars per exhibit station, and so will be affordable under smaller grants or community funding. We will seek out partner institutions and follow-on funding for replicating and distributing exhibits."""

Research will be conducted in the Brazilian and Peruvian Amazon, at sites near Manaus and Iquitos. Activities will build on and extend research conducted under NASA-funded LBA projects. Current approaches for sampling tropical tree diversity rely on field investigations that sample only a small portion of key environmental gradients. This project will bring together a close coupling of extensive field measurements of tree diversity patterns, satellite remote sensing to enable sampling across regional disturbance gradients, and community simulation models to better understand the mechanisms responsible for observed patterns at regional scales. The overarching hypothesis is that tree species community assembly patterns at the landscape scale, driven by episodic disturbance events, differ significantly from community assembly patterns at the local (<100 ha) scale. The project has four major goals: First, episodic tree mortality disturbance will be mapped over large Amazon landscapes using Landsat imagery, enabling the development of disturbance chronosequences covering more than 20 years. Second, the chronosequence data will be used to direct extensive field sampling to quantify tree species patterns across the landscape as a function of disturbance intensity, and time since disturbance. Third, the detection threshold for shifts in PFTs from the competitor to colonizer guild will be explored using hyperspectral (Hyperion) imagery. Fourth, a tractable community assembly model will be developed to explore which community assemblage mechanisms best fit the observed landscape-level patterns. Results will provide an improved understanding of shifts in tree diversity and PFTs with disturbance, and will help inform future NASA missions including DESDynI and HyspIRI. This project will directly address the stated goal of better understanding the current condition of Amazon forest biodiversity, and how it is changing over time."

COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND:  WMAP; CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS:  STEREO; GEOMAGNETIC STORMS:  THEMIS, MATHEMATICS CONTENT IS TRULY UNIVERSAL AND SPANS ALL NASA MISSIONS AND DIRECTORATES.  BASED UPON NEARLY IO-YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN DEVELOPING EXEMPLARY FORMAL EDUCATION CLASSROOM MATERIALS AT NASA FOR MATHEMATICS EDUCATION; 1) WE WILL DESIGN AND EXPAND MATHEMATICS PROBLEM OFFERINGS ACROSS SMD DIVISIONS AS NEW DISCOVERIES ARE ANNOUNCED, AND NEW MISSIONS ARE FLOWN; 2) WE WILL COLLABORATE WITH NASA SCIENCE MISSIONS TO SUPPORT THEIR NEEDS IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION BY CO-DEVELOPING MATHEMATICS ENRICHMENT PROBLEMS AND PROBLEM BOOKLETS THAT CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT A MORE QUANTITATIVE UNDERSTANDING O"
