STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEMS ARE ENVISAGED TO PROVIDE TWO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT CAPABILITIES FOR THE HEALTH MONITORING OF FUTURE AEROSPACE VEHICLES: DETECTING STRUCTURAL DAMAGE AND PERFORMING USAGE MONITORING. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS STATEMENT OF WORK IS TO BRING TOGETHER THESE TWO TECHNOLOGIES IN AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM DEMONSTRATION ON LARGE SCALE AEROSPACE VEHICLE STRUCTURES. INNOVATIVE CONCEPTS CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED BY ACELLENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC THROUGH AN SBIR PHASE I CONTRACT WILL BE APPLIED IN CONJUNCTION WITH RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY NASA DRYDEN IN A MULTI-PHASED SBIR PHASE III PROJECT.  THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY IS TO INCORPORATE PIEZOELECTRIC TRANSDUCERS (FOR DAMAGE DETECTION) AND FIBER OPTIC SENSORS (FOR USAGE MONITORING) INTO AN INTEGRATED STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING PACKAGE FOR INSTALLATIONS ON LARGE-SCALE AEROSPACE VEHICLE STRUCTURES. AS A FIRST STEP IN ACHIEVING THIS OVERALL GOAL, AN INTEGRATED DEMONSTRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED IN WHICH FIBER OPTIC SENSORS FOR USAGE MONITORING WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO A SINGLE PACKAGE THAT CAN SIMPLIFY CURRENT ATTACHMENT TECHNIQUES FOR LARGE SCALE APPLICATION.  THIS FIRST STEP IS DIRECTED AT ADDRESSING A DEFICIENCY IN BONDING ENORMOUS NUMBER OF FIBER OPTIC SENSORS TO THE SURFACES OF REALISTIC STRUCTURES. A RECENT EFFORT, FUNDED BY NASA\'S AERONAUTICS RESEARCH MISSION DIRECTORATE, HAS INVOLVED THE INSTALLATION OF APPROXIMATELY 3000 FIBER BRAGG GRATING (FBG) STRAIN SENSORS LOCATED ON SIX- 20-FT OPTICAL FIBERS BONDED TO THE UPPER WING SURFACES OF AN EXISTING PREDATOR-B (NAMED IKHANA). THESE FIBERS WERE INSTALLED USING CONVENTIONAL STRAIN SENSOR INSTALLATION TECHNIQUES. SUCH CONVENTIONAL INSTALLATION TECHNIQUES INVOLVED THE MASKING OF APPROXIMATELY 120-FT-LONG X 1 IN-WIDE RUNS ON THE UPPER WING SURFACES, HAND GRINDING THE PAINT AND COMPOSITE FILLER DOWN TO THE WING SURFACE ALONG THESE RUNS, ADHERING THE OPTICAL FIBERS TO THE WING SURFACES USING CONVENTIONAL STRAIN GAGE ADHESIVES AND PROCESSES, SEALING/SMOOTHING THE FINAL COATING OVER THE INSTALLATION, AND RE-PAINTING. WHILE ENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL THROUGHOUT FLIGHT TESTING, THESE TECHNIQUES ARE NOT OPTIMAL FOR ACCOMMODATING A GREATER NUMBER OF OPTICAL FIBERS IN MORE COMPLEX PATTERNS (E.G. THREE-AXIS, ROSETTE MEASUREMENTS). COMPLICATING THE PROBLEM IS THE FACT THAT LARGE-SCALE REALISTIC AIRCRAFT STRUCTURES ARE GEOMETRICALLY COMPLEX AND INCLUDE NUMEROUS EGRESS PORTS FOR UMBILICAL ATTACHMENTS, COMMUNICATIONS AND POWER CONNECTIONS, FUEL TANK PORTS, ACTUATOR HOUSING, AND STRUCTURALLY COMPLEX FEATURES SUCH AS STIFFENERS, FLANGES, GAPS, AND WING FOLDS. SUCH GEOMETRIC COMPLEXITIES MAKE THE EXTENSION OF CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES, SUCH AS THOSE USED ON THE IKHANA FLIGHT EXPERIMENT, FOR REALISTIC AEROSPACE STRUCTURES. AS A STEP TOWARDS THE HIGH-LEVEL GOAL, NASA DRYDEN IS SEEKING TO PARTNER WITH ACELLENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE AND EFFICIENT CONCEPTS AND APPROACHES FOR THE INSTALLATION OF THOUSANDS OF FIBER OPTIC SENSORS, MULTIPLEXED ALONG DOZENS OF OPTICAL FIBERS, ARRAYED IN COMPLEX PATTERNS (TO ACCOMMODATE ROSETTE MEASUREMENTS), BONDED TO THE SURFACE OF COMPLEX AEROSPACE VEHICLE STRUCTURES (E.G. LIFTING SURFACES, FUSELAGE, BULKHEADS). THIS STATEMENT OF WORK DEFINES TASKS THAT WILL PRODUCE SEVERAL NEW INSTALLATION CONCEPTS AMENABLE TO 1) RETRO-FIT EXISTING (I..E. ALREADY BUILT AND DEPLOYED) AEROSPACE VEHICLES (HEREAFTER REFERRED TO AS  RETRO-FIT  INSTALLATIONS), AND 2) INTEGRATE AS A STEP IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS OF COMPOSITE STRUCTURES FOR NEW AEROSPACE VEHICLES (HEREAFTER REFERRED TO AS  DURING FABRICATION  INSTALLATIONS). SUCH INSTALLATION TECHNIQUES AND APPROACHES WILL BE LIMITED IN SCOPE TO SURFACE, OR NEAR-SURFACE ATTACHMENTS, NOT EMBEDDED WITHIN THE COMPOSITE STRUCTURE.

The Adler's goals are to inspire children to develop a lifelong interest in science, expand its cun''ent audience, address community needs in math and science education, reach out to fiunilies and encourage an interest in STEM careers. Nationwide research about the state of scientific literacy in America provides an additional, compelling argument for transfOIming how the Adler engages children and their parents in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) learning and education. With six billion people on Earth, only a handful of humans wil1 have the privilege of going into space and visiting other worlds. TIlOse who go become witnesses for the rest - the eyes and ears, the hearts and spirits for the rest of humanity. But it takes a diverse team of thousands of scientists, engineers, technology and math-savvy individuals to accomplish these goals. When humans eventual1y set foot on Mars with their eyes fixed on other planets and moons, it may be the greatest story of the 21st century. When the first man or woman creates those historic footprints, at that moment every human being will stand vicariously in those boots. The accomplishments of the entire team will be celebrated.  The Adler is preparing itself to engage its visitors in this journey and exhilarating dream by making space sciences accessible. Astronomy and cosmology are diflicult to grasp yet essential to preparing for (and understanding) space exploration missions. In a new exhibition titled Deep Space Adventure, the Adler will promote renewed interest in science, space exploration and STEM careers. The Adler also will provide children with an exciting museum experience to spark their enthusiasm for space exploration, science, math and technology, and encourage them to consider their roles in future space missions. Their generation inherits a great legacy from voyages and discoveries of earlier centuries. To engage them in STEM at an early age, the Adler is developing the Explorers'' Club exhibition.  Through renovated galleries featuring new exhibitions, the Adler will motivate children to grasp their futures as designers of missions to explore the mysteries of the universe, or as biologists who discover life on other worlds. The Adler's plans answer a nationwide call to catalyze children's interest in STEM, and provide them with quality science education experiences to prepare for the demands of the future workforce, and ensure America's future economic vitality."""

This proposal will apply Ajax technology to the challenge of viewing large and scientifically useful images on the web.  The image algorithm suite we will develop will provide us the ability to view the solar disk and the inner heliosphere, labeled with feature recognition data products.  It will also provide the ability to tailor image viewer web applications to particular scientific goals of relevance to the LWS program.    Recent developments in web-based technologies have brought significant innovation to commercial websites.  The website http://maps.google.com (GoogleTM Maps) is a landmark application of these recent developments and an example of a new approach to web-based technologies known as Ajax.  The software driving GoogleTM Maps allows users to pan, scan and zoom at will over an apparent single enormous image of the Earth in a natural and intuitively appealing way.  We propose to apply Ajax technology to Living With a Star (LWS) applications by creating a suite of image retrieval, processing, display and storage algorithms that will implement the functionality required to be able to view and monitor features on the Sun and inner heliosphere simultaneously.  This suite of algorithms will be the engine that will power new and natural ways of visualizing the Sun and the inner heliosphere for the LWS program.  The technology that will be developed on completion of this proposal will provide an enabling capability for many disciplines to make their large images available easily on the web, and therefore satisfies the cross-disciplinary objective of the LWS program.  We propose an SDO image viewer to overlay different combinations of SDO data products with ancillary data.  The overlaid image tiles will be created on-the-fly, as preprocessing every possible combination of SDO image data would be far too costly in server resources.  Once created however, the images will be stored for future fast retrieval."""

However, we propose that it is exactly the magnetic field, or, more precisely, the balance of open and closed magnetic structures on local (supergranular, #tilde#20Mm) and global (coronal, >#tilde#100Mm) in the photosphere and chromosphere that defines the thermodynamic properties of coronal holes, providing a realistic basis to explore the support and sustenance of the kinetic solar wind. The chromosphere has been largely overlooked as a driving source of the solar wind despite its richness in emission and structure, largely due to the aforementioned complexity. Recently, we [McIntosh and Leamon ApJL, 624, 117, 2005] correlated the inferred topography of the solar chromospheric plasma with in situ solar wind velocity and composition data measured at 1 AU. Specifically, the measured separation in height of the TRACE 1600 and 1700 UV band pass filters correlate very strongly with solar wind velocity and inversely with the ratio of ionic oxygen (O7+/O6+) densities. These correlations suggest that the structure of the solar wind is rooted deeper in the solar atmosphere than has been previously considered and form the basis of an empirical solar wind model. The proposed model provides a near continuous range of solar wind speeds and composition quantities from the structure of the chromosphere and is more precise than the old fast/ coronal hole or slow/streamer belt"" estimate. By means of a coherent, planned and extended observation campaign of the solar chromosphere at disk center, we propose to extend our current results to better understand the nature of the solar wind, its sources and composition. One specific end goal for this three- year project is to develop a (near) real-time solar wind propagation model, with chromospheric topography as input. This useful tool for predictive space weather will have great impact in 2008 when we can replace the intermittent TRACE data with the full-disk, full-time chromospheric topography measurements of the first LWS mission, the Solar Dynamics Observatory. This proposal addresses Strategic Sub-goal 3B: ""Understand the Sun and its effects on Earth and the solar system,"" specifically NASA Science Outcomes 3B1 and 3B3. However, our improved physical understanding will yield a better observationally driven, physically based ability, to predict space weather on its own and as part of a community based collaborative model within the LWS program."""

Proposed Effort: From studies it has become obvious that the key enablers for future groundbreaking progress in GA are not only increased affordability but also other critical requirements such as improved performance and fuel efficiency; improved safety; ease of operation; drastic reduction of noise; acceptable performance specification. The design and development of new GA aircraft, with novel technologies for addressing these issues, represents a daunting challenge because of the scope of the radical design constraints due to the requirements of ease of manufacturing and maintenance, noise control, drastically improved safety, and efficiency. The proposed development of a scientifically based tool box for scaled model research, once validated for a typical GA aircraft such as the Cirrus SR22 with a relatively large scale model, will allow for drastically more cost-effective investigations of future GA aircraft concepts and will also considerably reduce the cost associated with the development and testing of novel technologies for GA . Specific key innovations associated with the proposed approach are; model as low-cost test-bed for future GA concept and technology development. Due to the relatively large scale to the validation model, chances are high that aerodynamic, dynamic and aeroelastic testing of critical design parts of new GA concepts can be accomplished with satisfactory fidelity.; Large empty shell composite structure and modular design to allow for flexible placement of flight hardware and adjustment of moments o inertia; Use of state-of-the-art prediction and simulation tools as well as wind/water tunnel experiments in design and data evaluation of dynamically scaled model research. The cost associated with the development of new aircraft, and especially with the testing required for FAA approval of new aircraft and aircraft technologies, is very high and hinders and/or stalls efforts by GA-companies to bring new advanced aircraft or advanced aircraft technologies to the market. Any effort of implementing novel technologies is financially risky and suffocates whatever healthy initiative and innovative ideas exist in the aviation industry."

However the excessive numerical diffusion inherently caused by discretization errors plus the possibly largest/finest grid requirement for rotor wake modeling prevents CFD to be routinely used in practical engineering calculations. The proposed Gradient Transport Correction (GTC) method provides an innovative artificial compression that can serves as a general confinement for greatly enhancing the resolution of rotor wake capturing while significantly reducing the grid requirement. In this proposal we have demonstrated the great potential of GTC method to counteract the numerical dissipation and absolutely preserve the wake vortical structure with a small number of grid cells. Phase I will develop an initial capability and the capability to be established in Phase I will be developed into a general engineering tool that has engineering analysis accuracy as well as transparent set-up for a broad range of important engineering calculations such as computing hover performance high-lift and separation flows as well as various types of multiple rotors.

LEO IS A RELATIVELY WARM THERMAL ENVIRONMENT AND WITHOUT CAREFUL THERMAL MANAGEMENT SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES OF STORED LIQUID CRYOGENS CAN BE LOST DUE TO BOIL-OFF. THIS REQUIRES THAT LARGER VOLUMES OF CRYOGENIC FUELS MUST BE LAUNCHED INTO ORBIT SO THAT SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES ARE AVAILABLE TO SATISFY THE MISSION PROPULSION REQUIREMENTS. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT ACTIVE COOLING USING SPACE CRYOCOOLERS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RESULT IN ZERO BOIL-OFF (ZBO) OF STORED CRYOGENS. THE LAUNCH-MASS SAVINGS USING ACTIVE COOLING EXCEEDS THAT OF PASSIVE COOLING OF LOX FOR MISSION DURATIONS IN LEO OF LESS THAN 1 WEEK. THE SAVINGS ADVANTAGE OF ACTIVE COOLING FOR LH2 BEGINS AFTER ABOUT 2 MONTHS IN LEO.

AdvR, Inc will develop a fiber coupled, high power, electro-optically controlled, phase modulator for the NASA Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The device should be capable of phase modulating a 1 W or greater, continuous wave optical signal at multi-gigahertz rates at 1064 nm. The key innovation is the use of a waveguide embedded in a non-linear optical material suitable for high optical power handling. The phase modulators used for LISA must be rugged and must perform optimally in a radiation environment over the mission lifetime. To achieve this goal, the phase modulator development will include a fiber-in-fiber-out design that will readily lend itself to future space qualification for mechanical stability of the package and radiation damage resistance of the non-linear optical material. The Phase I effort successfully established the feasibility of the waveguide approach by achieving high power in a waveguide, modulating the waveguide, and performing preliminary radiation testing of the material. During the Phase II effort, three essential issues will be addressed. These issues are long term optical performance of the chosen substrate, traveling wave electrode design for efficient modulation, and the development of a packaging platform suitable for future space qualification. The high power, fiber coupled phase modulator enables the creation of a device that is not commercially available. There are several NASA applications that will benefit from this technology development. The modulator will find uses in high power lasers systems to provide sidebands onto a carrier signal and lidar systems which utilize high power fiber amplifiers. An additional application is a visible light modulator for locking a laser wavelength to a gas absorption reference. The high optical power capability of the phase modulator provides the primary basis for AdvR to enter the commercial market with this product. The fiber coupled phase modulator provides an alternative to currently available free space coupled phase modulators that can handle similar optical powers, but are bulky and require high drive voltage to operate. Additionally, the fiber coupled modulator is capable of handling significantly higher optical powers than commercially available fiber coupled lithium niobate waveguide phase modulators."

THE SCOPE OF THE ALHAT PROJECT INCLUDES THE DEFINITION, DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, TEST, VERIFICATION, AND VALIDATION (V&V) OF AN INTEGRATED GUIDANCE, NAVIGATION AND CONTROL (GNC) LUNAR DESCENT AND LANDING SYSTEM CONSISTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVEL (TRL) 6.  THE ALHAT SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO BE APPLICABLE TO A VARIETY OF VEHICLE TYPES, BOTH CREWED AND NON-CREWED. THE AUTONOMOUS LANDING SCENARIOS DRIVE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR LANDING SENSOR ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY (SAFE AND PRECISE). THE CREWED SCENARIOS DRIVE THE NEED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AT VIDEO RATES (1 30 HZ) FOR USE SIMILAR TO A  HEADS UP  DISPLAY TO ALLOW CREW INTERFACE AND TO FACILITATE PROVISIONS FOR MANUALLY CONTROLLED LANDINGS. BOTH SCENARIOS COULD BE ACHIEVED USING A SINGLE INTEGRATED SENSOR SYSTEM, BUT FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN KEY TECHNOLOGIES IS NEEDED FOR MEETING THE ALHAT OBJECTIVES.  TO MEET THE SAFE AND PRECISE LANDING REQUIREMENTS, THE ALHAT SYSTEM WILL MAKE USE OF THE 3-D IMAGING SENSOR DATA TO DETECT AND AVOID POTENTIAL LANDING HAZARDS DURING THE FINAL STAGES OF THE POWERED DESCENT FOR LUNAR LANDING. THE ALHAT SYSTEM LANDING SENSOR AND ASSOCIATED ALGORITHMS WILL BE CAPABLE OF DETECTING AND LOCATING LANDING HAZARDS SUCH AS ROCKS, CRATERS, SLOPES OR OTHER DISCONTINUOUS SURFACE FEATURES. THIS ABILITY TO DETECT AND LOCATE HAZARDS WILL ENABLE THE POTENTIAL FOR TRAJECTORY RETARGETING AND MANEUVERING TO A SAFE LANDING SITE.

AdvR, Inc will develop a fiber coupled, high power, electro-optically controlled, phase modulator for the NASA Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The device should be capable of phase modulating a 1 W or greater, continuous wave optical signal at multi-gigahertz rates at 1064 nm. The key innovation is the use of a waveguide embedded in a non-linear optical material suitable for high optical power handling. The phase modulators used for LISA must be rugged and must perform optimally in a radiation environment over the mission lifetime. To achieve this goal, the phase modulator development will include a fiber-in-fiber-out design that will readily lend itself to future space qualification for mechanical stability of the package and radiation damage resistance of the non-linear optical material. The Phase I effort successfully established the feasibility of the waveguide approach by achieving high power in a waveguide, modulating the waveguide, and performing preliminary radiation testing of the material. During the Phase II effort, three essential issues will be addressed. These issues are long term optical performance of the chosen substrate, traveling wave electrode design for efficient modulation, and the development of a packaging platform suitable for future space qualification. The high power, fiber coupled phase modulator enables the creation of a device that is not commercially available. There are several NASA applications that will benefit from this technology development. The modulator will find uses in high power lasers systems to provide sidebands onto a carrier signal and lidar systems which utilize high power fiber amplifiers. An additional application is a visible light modulator for locking a laser wavelength to a gas absorption reference. The high optical power capability of the phase modulator provides the primary basis for AdvR to enter the commercial market with this product. The fiber coupled phase modulator provides an alternative to currently available free space coupled phase modulators that can handle similar optical powers, but are bulky and require high drive voltage to operate. Additionally, the fiber coupled modulator is capable of handling significantly higher optical powers than commercially available fiber coupled lithium niobate waveguide phase modulators."

The PLC integrates a frequency doubling element, a waveguide splitter, and phase modulator into a monolithic, waveguide-based device. This technology is important for lidar systems requiring high frequency stability and accuracy. The proposed device, with the proper IR input, will generate the required visible radiation, spectrally formatted for the HSRL seed laser stabilization scheme. The PLC concept advances NASA's lidar systems due to its compact, efficient, and reliable design, thus enabling use on small aircraft and satellites. The key objective in this SBIR Phase II proposal is to develop and incorporate the PLC into a deployable, all fiber-based seed laser system for NASA-LaRC's HSRL cloud and aerosol measurements. POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) In addition to NASA's use in various lidar systems, the PLC has applications in free space communications, metrology, spectroscopy and the medical industry. A number of medical applications such as phase-modulation fluorimetry in bioprocess and clinical monitoring may benefit from this technology. A number of commercial lidar or lidar-like systems will benefit from the insertion of the PLC. These markets, which are presently inadequately accessed, include security, defense, space, forestry, floodplain measurement, land use assessment, bathymetry, robotics and machine vision applications. As costs are reduced, a host of lidar-based applications will emerge, such as smart cruise control, lane change notification, traffic flow and robotic control. Non-lidar applications for the PLC also offer opportunities in medical imaging, therapeutic lasers, fiber optical channel switching, active Q-switching, free space communication. POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The primary customer is NASA Langley's High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) program for aerosol and cloud characterization. The proposed PLC will find multiple uses in other NASA's lidar remote sensing programs, such in altimetry and DIAL lidar in which a waveguide phase modulator is used to stabilize a single frequency seed laser, and also has potential application in spectroscopic measurement techniques. NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA."

It is not enough to depend on the excitement generated by NASA images. NASA must use discoveries and achievements to engage students and the education community. NASA provides meaningful, educational, and content-rich programs to inspire students at all levels to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). NASA Education partners with academia, professional associations, industry, and other agencies to provide teachers and faculty with experiences that capitalize on the excitement of NASA's missions. Education Programs provide opportunities for involvement in NASA's research efforts to encourage students to pursue higher education in STEM areas. To ensure a pipeline of highly trained people prepared to meet mission requirements within NASA, as well as in industry and academia, NASA must: motivate students to pursue careers in STEM areas; provide educators with unique teaching tools and compelling teaching experiences; ensure that public resources are invested wisely; and fully engage minority and underrepresented students, educators, and researchers in NASA's education programs. The Office of Education strives to reach youth with whom to connect, excite, and inspire the next generation of scientists, inventors, technicians, and explorers."

This monitor will employ Aerodyne's proprietary Cavity Attenuated Phase Shift spectroscopy technology in order to produce a far simpler, smaller and lower cost alternative to more traditional instruments with no loss in sensitivity or accuracy. A unique property of the proposed instrument is that it requires little or no calibration. The Phase I work plan will focus on a proof-of-principle demonstration of the proposed technique tht compares its performance with a conventional particle absorbance monitor. The Phase II project will entail constructing a field-ready prototype using the information gained in the Phase I studies and deploying the sensor on various field missions undertaken by Aerodyne's particle measurement research group. Aerosol particles affect the radiative balance of the earth directly by scattering and absorbing solar and terrestrial radiation and indirectly by acting as cloud condensation nuclei. The atmospheric loading of aerosols generated through human activities can exert an influence on the earth's radiation budget comparable in magnitude with greenhouse gases. The uncertainties in the current understanding of aerosol direct and indirect forcing limit the ability to quantify human influences on climate change."

There is a need to research and develop traffic flow and ATM methods that mitigate the turbulence impact to NAS operations but turbulence is poorly represented in current airspace simulation and planning tools. AeroTech proposes to improve these tools and therefore airspace operations by developing and integrating an ATM Turbulence Impact Module (ATM-TIM) into FACET and/or ACES. The module will enable researchers and planners to identify and assess the impact of actual turbulence in the NAS and examine performance capability of new ATM methods with turbulence present. A key enhancement will be the incorporation of a turbulence dimension into the ATM Weather Impact Model that enables the modeling of the impact of convective and clear air turbulence. Phase I will develop the enhanced ATM weather impact model, investigate the integration of ATM-TIM components into the simulation tools and perform a proof of concept study. By Phase III the integrated ATM-TIM will improve planners understanding of turbulence's impact on ATM and assist in evaluating new TFM ideas in a turbulent NAS."

AeroTech will develop 3-Dimensional Wind and Turbulence Measurement System for UAVs that is based on thermal anemometer technology and that will measure and resolve science quality wind vector and turbulence information throughout the flight envelope. The System will provide high quality data that will improve NASA's ability to validate, verify and supplement spaced-based measurements taken during missions.

RESULTS OF THE PHASE I EFFORT PROVIDE A BROAD, SYSTEMS-BASED ASSESSMENT OF SEVERAL INNOVATIVE COMBINED CIRCULATION CONTROL (C3) TECHNIQUES THAT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL SOLUTION IN THE SPACE OF HIGH LIFT TECHNOLOGIES. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PROPOSED PHASE II PROGRAM WILL BE: 1) ENHANCEMENT OF THE OVERALL SYSTEMS-BASED C3 IMPACTS ANALYSIS BY REFINING THE WEIGHT, COMPRESSED AIR REQUIREMENTS, PROPULSION SYSTEM, FLIGHT PERFORMANCE, ENVIRONMENTAL, COST, AND RELIABILITY IMPACTS ANALYSES AS WELL AS CONDUCTING A MEANINGFUL EXAMINATION OF FIGURE OF MERIT WEIGHTING SCHEMES. 2) LOW SPEED WIND TUNNEL TESTS OF A 3D SEMI-SPAN MODEL WITH INTEGRATED C3 SYSTEMS TO GENERATE AERODYNAMIC DATA THAT INCLUDE INTERACTION EFFECTS AMONG THE CIRCULATION CONTROL DEVICES. 3) EXECUTION OF AN EXPERIMENTAL FLIGHT PROGRAM USING A SUBSCALE CEETA TESTBED THAT ENABLES DIRECT PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS BETWEEN AN AIRCRAFT EQUIPPED WITH C3-BASED HIGH LIFT DEVICES AND AN AIRCRAFT EQUIPPED WITH CONVENTIONAL HIGH LIFT DEVICES AT THE SAME WING LOADING, AS WELL AS EVALUATIONS OF REAL-WORLD ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEGRATING C3 DEVICES INTO A FLIGHT-READY VEHICLE. POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 1500 CHARACTERS, APPROXIMATELY 150 WORDS)  A SYNERGY MAP WAS CREATED THAT LISTED SPECIFIC NASA MILESTONES FOR WHICH THIS PROJECT HAS BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT RELEVANCE. A TOTAL OF 53 SPECIFIC MILESTONES WERE LISTED WITH 33 HAVING DIRECT RELEVANCE AND 20 HAVING INDIRECT RELEVANCE. OF THE TWELVE ARMD PROJECTS, FOUR CONTAINED NO RELEVANT MILESTONES: 1) SUPERSONICS EDL, 2) AGING AIRCRAFT AND DURABILITY, 3) INTELLIGENT INTEGRATED FLIGHT DECK, AND 4) AIRPORTAL. THE SUBSONIC FIXED WING (SFW) PROJECT HAD THE MOST RELEVANCE (22 RELEVANT MILESTONES) FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY THE INTEGRATED RESILIENT AIRCRAFT CONTROL (IRAC) PROJECT (17 RELEVANT MILESTONES). ALSO, NASA''S NEXTGEN WHICH IS BASED ON THE JPDO''S VISION OF THE NGATS HAS FOUR STRATEGIC GOALS, NAMELY: 1) INCREASED CAPACITY, 2) IMPROVED SAFETY AND RELIABILITY, 3) INCREASED EFFICIENCY AND PERFORMANCE, AND 4) REDUCED ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED IN THIS PROJECT DIRECTLY SUPPORTS ALL OF THESE GOALS. POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 1500 CHARACTERS, APPROXIMATELY 150 WORDS)  THERE ARE MANY MILITARY APPLICATIONS OF THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED IN THIS PROJECT. SOME OF THESE INCLUDE ESTOL CARGO AND TROOP TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT AND SHIPBOARD AIRCRAFT. SUPER-CIRCULATION CAN BE AN ENABLING TECHNOLOGY FOR LAUNCHING AND RECOVERING MEDIUM AND LARGE AIRCRAFT FROM SHORT AND UNPREPARED FIELDS WITHOUT REQUIRING SPECIALIZED LAUNCH AND RECOVERY EQUIPMENT AND WITHOUT INCURRING LARGE CRUISE PERFORMANCE PENALTIES DUE TO HIGH LIFT SYSTEMS.  THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS IN COMMERCIAL AIRLINERS, BUSINESS JETS, AND REGIONAL TRANSPORTS. IN GENERAL, EQUIPPING THESE AIRCRAFT WITH CRUISE-EFFICIENT HIGH-LIFT DEVICES CAN ENHANCE AIRPORT OPTIONS, GIVE THE USER MORE VALID RUNWAY CHOICES AT EXISTING AIRPORTS, AND HELP ALLEVIATE ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE PROBLEMS NEAR AIRPORTS BY ALLOWING STEEPER CLIMB-OUTS AND APPROACHES. MANUFACTURERS OF THESE AIRCRAFT INCLUDE BOEING, GULFSTREAM, AND CESSNA, AMONG OTHERS. THE BOEING COMPANY IN PARTICULAR, RECOGNIZING THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THE TECHNOLOGY, HAS AGREED TO PARTNER WITH AEROTONOMY AND GTRI ON THE PHASE II.

The research and technology development effort is directed at important trace gases of interest to NASA, including carbon monoxide, ammonia, alcohols and formaldehyde. The goal is low temperature catalytic oxidation and regenerative adsorption, both of which are of high interest. The proposed system is regenerable and expected to have lower equivalent systems mass and improved performance to conventional (activated carbon) systems. Outside of NASA markets include applications for residential and industrial air filtration, pollutions abatement, homeland security and military. The proposed alternative methods for scale-up of the mesh materials have potential for substantially reducing the cost over the initial concept evaluated during the phase I activity. The proposal focuses on an area of high relevance to NASA Constellation Program: spacecraft cabin trace contaminant control. The approach is very novel and involves a CNT covered stainless steel mesh integrated of functionalized with materials to improve its catalytic oxidation properties (for removal of carbon monoxide, alcohols and formaldehyde) and adsorptive properties (for removal of ammonia). The proposed technology exploits the physical properties of CNTs with respect to high electrical and thermal conductivity and surface area to volume ratio. The small business and research institution provides complementary experience and facilities, although neither include specific expertise in atmospheric trace contaminant control. The Phase II effort includes risk in the area of ammonia adsorption, which had less emphasis during Phase I. The survey and discussion of literature could have been improved if it included content on state of the art trace contaminant control systems, atmospheric requirements including spacecraft maximum allowable concentrations (SMAC) of trace gases, and ammonia adsorption."

The hardware on the space suit was- and still is- fabricated and designed by Air-Lock, Inc.; the soft goods were a product of ILC Dover. Over the past 20 years, the uses for the MK-III space suit technology demonstrator have been quite varied. Most recently the suit has been serving in comparative space suit testing with other styles of prototype space suits and current flight program space suit configurations. The comparative analysis allows engineers to put quantitative values to the subjective data that has been collected with respect to suit mobility. Test data is being used by the Exploration Program to develop requirements for lunar surface extra vehicular activity tasks. Functional mobility range of motion testing has included the following activities: walking, crawling, kneeling, ascending and descending a ladder, translating up and down an inclined surface, shoveling, hammering, ingressing and egressing seats, and the operation of multiple hatch actuation concepts. Further the MK-III, has been utilized on the reduced gravity aircraft for interface feasibility testing with the Constellation Program Orion vehicle side hatch, the low impact docking system tunnel, and micro-gravity space suit don and doff testing. The MK-III space suit technology demonstrator also serves as the primary suit for the Desert Research and Technology Studies conducted each year in Arizona. The Desert Research and Technology Studies activities center around the development and testing of hardware and mission operations anticipated for future planetary exploration programs. Most notably, the MK-III space suit technology demonstrator has be used to study the interfaces between a suited subject and the Science, Crew, Operations and Utility Test bed (SCOUT), which is a combination planetary roving vehicle and robotic assistant. The interfaces studied include the suit to seat interface, the suit to displays interface, and the suit to controls interface."

OUR STUDENTS COMPLETED A CURRICULUM CONSISTING OF TOPICS IN MATHEMATICS, ROBOTICS, ELECTRONICS, SURVEYING, BRIDGE BUILDING, ENERGY CONVERSION, COMPUTER PROGRAMMING AND WEB SITE DESIGN. STUDENTS TOOK FIELD TRIPS TO THE ALABAMA SPACE AND ROCKET CENTER AND THE CHEVROLET CORVETTE FACTORY AND MUSEUM. THE CAPSTONE EVENT OF THE PROGRAM WAS AN AWARDS CEREMONY WHEREAT THE STUDENTS PRESENTED SUMMARIES OF THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE FORM OF MICROSOFT POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS TO ASSEMBLED PARENTS. UNIVERSITY FACULTY AND GOVERNMENT/INDUSTRY OBSERVERS AND RECEIVED AWARDS FOR COMPETITIONS HELD IN THE VARIOUS ACADEMIC ENDEAVORS. THE MICHAEL P. ANDERSON PROGRAM IS AN INTENSIVE TECHNICAL OUTREACH PROGRAM HELD DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS AT ALABAMA A&amp;M UNIVERSITY. THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO HELP ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE OF U.S. STUDENTS GRADUATING IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING BY ENCOURAGING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO APPRECIATE CAREERS IN ENGINEERING AND TO RECOGNIZE THE CHALLENGES OF AND PROPERLY PREPARE FOR AN ENGINEERING CURRICULUM. THE PROGRAM PROVIDES EXPERIENCES THAT STIMULATE STUDENT INTEREST IN MATHEMATICS, TECHNOLOGY, COMPUTERS AND THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES. IT PROVIDES PERSONAL CONTACTS WITH BOTH ENGINEERING INSTRUCTORS AND UNDERGRADUATE ENGINEERING MAJORS AND PROVIDES CRITICAL CURRICULA INFORMATION FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS. THE 2007 PROGRAM WAS THE THIRD IN WHAT WE BELIEVE WILL BECOME A SUMMER TRADITION AT ALABAMA A&amp;M UNIVERSITY. WE NOW WANT TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM TO REACH STUDENTS NOT ONLY FROM THE HUNTSVILLE AREA BUT FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF ALABAMA AND, EVENTUALLY, NATIONWIDE. WE PLAN TO EXTEND THE PROGRAM TO FOUR WEEKS DURATION AND, FUNDING PERMITTING, BRING STUDENTS TO THE CAMPUS TO STAY IN UNIVERSITY DORMITORIES FOR THE DURATION OF THE PROGRAM. WE WILL ALSO ADD NEW ENGINEERING TOPICS TO OUR CURRICULUM. THIS PROPOSAL OUTLINES THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM AND IDENTIFIES THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THE 2008 MICHAEL P. ANDERSON OUTREACH PROGRAM. THE MICHAEL P. ANDERSON OUTREACH PROGRAM WAS NAMED AFTER LT. COL. MICHAEL P. ANDERSON, A BLACK AMERICAN ASTRONAUT WHO WAS ONE OF THE CREW OF SEVEN ASTRONAUTS ABOARD STS-107 KILLED IN THE SPACE SHUTTLE ACCIDENT OF FEBRUARY 1, 2003. THE SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY AT ALABAMA A&amp;M UNIVERSITY INVITES YOU TO INVEST IN THE QUALITY OF YOUR FUTURE ENGINEERING WORKFORCE BY MAKING A GENEROUS PLEDGE OF SUPPORT FOR THE MICHAEL P.

With the support of NASA's SARA and APRA programs, over the past four years we have made substantial progress in this work. Our work has focused on calculations of 1) ielectronic recombination (DR), 2) fluorescence and Auger yields due to a Is vacancy, and 3) inner-shell photoabsorption. DR is the dominant electron-ion recombination for most ions in cosmic plasmas. Recently our group has completed calculations of DR for the H-like through Na-like isoelectronic series for elements up through Zn, Our theoretical calculations are in good agreement with existing high-resolution storage ring measurements for Fe ions. Accurate fluorescence yield and Auger yield data due to Is vacancies are needed for modeling shocked gas in supernova remnants and X-ray photoionized plasmas. We have completed calculations for the entire second row of isoelectronic series for elements up through Zn, Our results have revealed large errors in the fluorescence/Auger database currently being used by the astrophysicists, and we have elucidated the higher-order effects that are necessary for the proper description of these atomic processes. Accurate photoabsorption cross sections are also required to model properly X-ray photoionizaed plasmas. We have completed calculations for the the photoabsorption of all oxygen and neon ions and have included these data into the modeling of abundances in the ISM and opacities in accretion disks. Unlike existing independent-particle data, our method is ideally suited for modeling the observed X-ray absorption features by also including resonance excitation, Auger broadening, and relaxation effects. We propose to continue our DR, fluorescence, and photoabsorption work. We will extend our DR work to calculate rate coefficients for isoelectronic sequences of the more complicated third row elements. We will also continue calculating new Auger/fluorescence data. In specific, we will investigate lsuelectronic sequences for which multiple electrons and/or photons can be emitted. We will continue research along the lines of inner shell photoabsorption for all ions of carbon, magnesium, silicon and sulfur, working in close collaboration with X-ray modeler colleagues. All of our new atomic data will be made publicly available and will be used by us in the non-equilibrium plasma simulation code CLOUDY to enable more accurate interpretations of ionized mission/absorption line gas. Our work will be relevant to the interpretation of spectroscopic data from a range of past, present, and future satellite observatories including WE, HST, EUVE, ISO, HUT, ORFEUS, Einstein, EXOSAT, ROSAT, ASCA, FUSE, GALEX, NGST, Chandra, XMM, JWST, SIRTF, ASTRO-E2, and Constellation-X."

In preparation for these projects the facility needs to determine the feasibility of accommodating large scale test articles, integration and facility operations/interactions, at conditions that are currently out of the facilities capabilities. The objectives of this task order are to resolve ground testing issues related to these large scale test articles using a blockage model and develop test capabilities required to meet program requirements.  In order to achieve the test capabilities the facility will require a new Mach 4 and Mach 6 nozzle. These new nozzles will be an interagral part of the 8-Ft HTT at NASA Langley Research Center.  The new nozzles will provide the existing facility expanded capability required to meet the testing goals of test programs present and future.  Large scale test articles pose issues with accurately determining blockage effects due to their complex shapes and the resulting complex flow interactions between the large scale test article and the facility.  A blockage model will help resolve most of these issues in preparation for ground testing large scale test articles.  The purpose of this task order is to obtain the designs, analysis, manufacturing schedules and estimates of long lead items for a new Mach 4 and new Mach 6 nozzles as well a trade study for a large scale blockage model.

This continuation project builds upon more than a decade of the ACCESS project, during which AAAS recruited, screened, placed and followed up on a diverse group of talented students with disabilities at 10 NASA sites around the country, and NASA/Headquarters in Washington, DC. The recruitment of a high level of talent and the need for increased diversity of students entering the NASA pipeline has fostered a request by NASA sites for more summer interns with disabilities. This proposal requests funding for placement of a minimum of 20 undergraduate and graduate students with disabilities, majoring in science, mathematics, physics, technology, engineering, and some business areas. The interns will represent diverse cultural, gender, geographic, and academic backgrounds, in nine NASA centers and Headquarters for 10-week summer internships."
