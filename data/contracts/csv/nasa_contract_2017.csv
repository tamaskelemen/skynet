OVER THE PAST DECADE, COSTS FOR DATA STORAGE SYSTEMS AND COMPUTING HAVE BOTH DROPPED EXPONENTIALLY. THIS HAS OPENED THE DOOR FOR BIG DATA PROCESSING USING SPACEBORNE OPTICAL IMAGERY TO CHARACTERIZE LAND SURFACE PHENOMENA IN HIGH-END COMPUTING (HEC; ACRONYMS LIST ON PAGE 21) ENVIRONMENTS. RECENT EXAMPLES INCLUDE GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE, AMAZON WEB SERVICES CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES, NASA EARTH EXCHANGE AND NASA CENTER FOR CLIMATE SIMULATION (NCCS) ADVANCED DATA ANALYTICS PLATFORM (ADAPT). AT THE SAME TIME, A GROWING CONSTELLATION OF COMMERCIAL VERY-HIGH-RESOLUTION (VHR) SATELLITES OFFER GLOBAL 1-2-DAY REPEAT COVERAGE THAT CAN COMPLEMENT NASA EARTH OBSERVING (EO) MISSIONS WITH STEREO AND SUPER-SPECTRAL CAPABILITIES. THROUGH NO-DIRECT-COST LICENSING AGREEMENTS THE NATIONAL GEOSPATIAL-INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (NGA) AND NASA GODDARD SPACEFLIGHT CENTER (GSFC) ARE ACQUIRING PETABYTES OF ARCHIVED DIGITALGLOBE (DG) 0.3 0.5 M PANCHROMATIC AND 2 4 M MULTI-SPECTRAL IMAGERY FROM AROUND THE GLOBE. THE DG ARCHIVE INCLUDES DATA FROM 7 SATELLITES INCLUDING WORLDVIEW-1, 2, 3, 4, QUICKBIRD-2, GEOEYE-1 AND IKONOS-2. PRIOR TO 2008, A LIMITED NUMBER OF EO VHR IMAGES WERE OFTEN USED INDIVIDUALLY FOR EVALUATION AND VALIDATION OVER SMALL AREAS, TO COMPARE TO COARSER RESOLUTION NASA EO DATA BECAUSE THESE DATA WERE SNAPSHOTS IN SPACE AND TIME. NOW, THE DG CONSTELLATION ENABLES REPEAT, CONTIGUOUS COVERAGE OVER LARGE REGIONS. THESE DATA ARE A VALUABLE EO RESOURCE FOR SCALING GLOBAL ECOLOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL PHENOMENA OCCURRING AT SUBMETER SCALES THAT CAN ENHANCE NASA EO SCIENCE THAT OCCURS AT MODERATE TO COARSE RESOLUTIONS. THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO PROVIDE TOOLS AS AN APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE (API) FOR MASS PROCESSING SPATIALLY CONTIGUOUS AND TEMPORALLY CONSISTENT ARCHIVED NASA-GSFC DG VHR DATA THAT CAN ONLY EFFICIENTLY BE PERFORMED ON NASA HEC RESOURCES DUE TO DG-NGA LICENSING LIMITATIONS AND COMPUTATIONAL REQUIREMENTS."

THE MULTI-DISCIPLINARY WORK PROPOSED HERE INTEGRATES REMOTE-SENSING, FIELD-BASED, AND SOCIOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS IN THE Y-K DELTA REGION. NOTABLY, ALL PHASES OF THE PROJECT WILL BE INFORMED BY QUANTITATIVE, REPEAT SAMPLING OF VEGETATION, SOIL, HYDROLOGY, AND PERMAFROST PROPERTIES ACROSS A LONG-TERM MONITORING PLOT NETWORK THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE MID-1990S AND IS WELL-SUITED FOR VALIDATING MULTI-TEMPORAL REMOTE-SENSING DATASETS. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES ARE TO (1) ELUCIDATE LINKS BETWEEN THE PRODUCTIVITY OF Y-K DELTA ECOSYSTEMS AND REGIONAL-SCALE ATMOSPHERIC AND CRYOSPHERIC CLIMATE DRIVERS; (2) RESOLVE THE SPATIAL EXTENT AND DRIVERS OF LONG-TERM CHANGES IN VEGETATION AND PHYSICAL LANDSCAPE PROPERTIES RELATED TO LANDSCAPE-SCALE DISTURBANCE PROCESSES; (3) CHARACTERIZE CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE OF TUNDRA VEGETATION ACROSS A NETWORK OF LONG-TERM MONITORING PLOTS; AND (4) RELATE THE OBSERVED CHANGES TO LOCAL OBSERVATIONS AND CONCERNS REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE, IMPACTS TO ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, AND COMMUNITY SUSTAINABILITY. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL OCCUR IN THREE PHASES OVER FOUR YEARS. IN 2015, RESEARCH ACTIVITIES WILL FOCUS ON ANALYSIS OF MULTI-DECADAL REMOTE-SENSING DATA TIME-SERIES, AND RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES OF HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGERY. RESULTS OF THE REMOTE-SENSING ANALYSIS WILL BE USED TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A GROUND-BASED DATA COLLECTION EFFORT FOCUSED ON VEGETATION, SOILS, HYDROLOGY, AND PERMAFROST ACROSS ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS NEAR TWO YUPIK POPULATION CENTERS: THE CENTRAL COAST REGION NEAR CHEVAK AND THE YUKON DELTA NEAR EMMONAK.

THE WHOLE WISE CATALOG CONTAINS OVER 747 MILLION SOURCES OF ALL KINDS (CUTRI ET AL. 2013). THIS MASSIVE ARCHIVE SERVES AS A CRUCIAL PRECURSOR SURVEY FOR THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE (JWST), TO BE LAUNCHED IN OCTOBER 2018. HOWEVER, SEARCHES FOR OBJECTS WITH LARGE SPACE MOTIONS IN WISE DATA HAVE YET TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FULL DEPTH AND TIME BASELINE OF THE WISE IMAGES. THE LIMITING MAGNITUDES OF THE WISE ALL-SKY CATALOG ARE APPROXIMATELY W1=16.6 AND W2=16.0. YET PROPER MOTION SURVEYS (SCHNEIDER ET AL. 2016) SO FAR HAVE GENERALLY BEEN LIMITED TO OBJECTS WITH W2 MAGNITUDE<14.5. FURTHERMORE, WISE HAS CONTINUED TO SCAN THE SKY IN THE W1 AND W2 BANDS THROUGH THE NEAR EARTH OBJECT WISE-REACTIVATION (NEOWISER) PROJECT. NEOWISER IMAGING THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN RELEASED INCREASES THE TIME BASELINE AVAILABLE IN THE W1 AND W2 BANDS BY A FACTOR #tilde#10; THIS TIME BASELINE HAS NOT BEEN FULLY EXPLOITED IN PUBLISHED BD SEARCHES. TO EFFICIENTLY SCOUR THIS UNEXPLORED DISCOVERY SPACE, WE HAVE LAUNCHED A NEW CITIZEN SCIENCE WEBSITE, BACKYARDWORLDS.ORG (KUCHNER ET AL. 2017). THIS WEBSITE, PART OF THE ZOONIVERSE CITIZEN SCIENCE COMMUNITY TOGETHER WITH GALAXY ZOO, PLANET HUNTERS AND MANY OTHER FLAGSHIP CITIZEN SCIENCE PROJECTS (SEE HTTP://WWW.ZOONIVERSE.ORG), ENGAGES LAYPERSON VOLUNTEERS TO EXAMINE IMAGES FROM WISE TO LOOK FOR HIGH-PROPER MOTION OBJECTS.

ALSO, THE REQUIRED ENERGY DEPOSITION RATE IS MUCH HIGHER IN ARS COMPARED TO CORONAL HOLES OR THE QUIET SUN. MANY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT AN ENERGY DEPOSITION MECHANISM MUST BE OPERATING IN THE SOLAR CORONA TO MAINTAIN THE TEMPERATURES OBSERVED. A LEADING THEORY IS THAT THE CORONA IS HEATED BY LARGE NUMBER OF SMALL ENERGY RELEASE EVENTS KNOWN AS NANOFLARES. A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE NUMBER OF NANOFLARES, WITH SUFFICIENTLY HIGH OCCURRENCE RATE, CAN PROVIDE ENOUGH ENERGY TO HEAT THE CORONA. INSTRUMENTATION LIMITATIONS MEAN THAT NANOFLARES ARE NOT OBSERVED DIRECTLY: THEREFORE, MUCH OF THE EVIDENCE FOR THEIR EXISTENCE IS INFERRED FROM OBSERVATIONS AND NUMERICAL MODELING. DETERMINING THE ENERGY DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE RATE OF NANOFLARES IN THE AR CORONA WOULD BE A HUGE STEP FORWARD IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HEATING IN CORONAL PLASMAS. VIALL&KLIMCHUK 2011, 2013, 2014, 2017 HAVE SHOWN THAT THE TIMING OF AR CORONAL EMISSION BRIGHTENINGS IN MULTIPLE CHANNELS OF SOLAR DYNAMICS OBSERVATORY ATMOSPHERIC IMAGING ASSEMBLY (SDO/AIA) FOLLOWS THAT EXPECTED FROM SIMULATIONS OF A NANOFLARE-HEATED CORONA. USING NUMERICAL HYDRODYNAMIC RADIATIVE EMISSION MODEL FOR THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE (HYDRAD)-BASED SIMULATIONS OF AIA EMISSION FOR AN AR, BRADSHAW&VIALL 2016 HAVE SHOWN THAT THE TIMING OF CORONAL EMISSION BRIGHTENINGS IS DEPENDENT ON THE PROPERTIES OF THE NANOFLARE ENERGY DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE RATE. RELATEDLY, IRELAND ET AL. 2015 SHOW THAT AVERAGE POWER SPECTRA P(F) (WHERE F IS FREQUENCY) OF TIME SERIES OF AIA 171  AND 193  AR IMAGES ARE DOMINATED BY POWER LAWS, P(F)#tilde#F^(-Z), Z>0. IRELAND ET AL. 2015 SHOW THAT A DISTRIBUTION OF EXPONENTIALLY DECAYING EVENTS OF EMISSION E ALONG THE LINE-OF-SIGHT (LOS), WHERE N(E)#tilde#E^(-M) AND THE SIZE OF THE EMISSION DEPENDS ON ITS DURATION T SUCH THAT E#tilde#T^K CREATES A POWER LAW POWER SPECTRUM P(F)#tilde#F^-K(2-M). CONSEQUENTLY, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT A DISTRIBUTION OF NANOFLARE EVENTS CAUSES BOTH THE EMISSION POWER-LAW POWER SPECTRUM IN AIA TIME-SERIES AS WELL AS THE OBSERVED BRIGHTENING TIME-LAGS. THEREFORE, WE WILL USE THE AIA EMISSION POWER-LAW POWER SPECTRA AND BRIGHTENING TIME-LAGS IN COMBINATION FOR THE FIRST TIME AS CONSTRAINTS ON THE ENERGY DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE RATE OF NANOFLARES. METHODOLOGY: WE WILL STUDY THE FOURIER POWER SPECTRA OF THE EMISSION GENERATED BY SIMULATED NANOFLARE ENERGY DEPOSITION EVENTS, AND COMPARE THAT TO THE OBSERVED FOURIER POWER SPECTRA FOR THE ARS STUDIED BY VIALL&KLIMCHUK 2012, 2017 AND WARREN ET AL. 2012. WE WILL USE THE ENTHALPY BASED THERMAL EVOLUTION OF LOOPS (EBTEL) AND HYDRAD NUMERICAL MODELS APPLIED TO AR MAGNETIC SKELETONS TO CALCULATE THE EMISSION ALONG THE LOS. THE TOTAL EMISSION MEASURE WILL THEN BE FOLDED THROUGH THE INSTRUMENT RESPONSE OF AIA. BY COMPARING THE OBSERVED AND SIMULATED AIA POWER SPECTRA IN ALL CHANNELS, AND SIMULTANEOUSLY REQUIRING THAT THE OBSERVED AND SIMULATED AIA EMISSION HAVE THE SAME CROSS-AIA CHANNEL TIME-LAG PROPERTIES, WE WILL DISCOVER IMPORTANT NEW CONSTRAINTS ON THE POSSIBLE DISTRIBUTIONS AND FREQUENCY RATES OF NANOFLARES THAT REPRODUCE THE OBSERVED EMISSION. THIS WILL HELP ANSWER A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IN SOLAR PHYSICS - WHY IS THE CORONA HOT? RELEVANCE TO THE HELIOPHYSICS DECADAL SURVEY: ANSWERS TWO HIGH LEVEL SCIENCE GOALS (1)  DETERMINE THE ORIGINS OF THE SUN S ACTIVITY AND PREDICT THE VARIATIONS IN THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT  AND (2)  DISCOVER AND CHARACTERIZE FUNDAMENTAL PROCESSES THAT OCCUR BOTH WITHIN THE HELIOSPHERE AND THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE.  WE WILL USE DATA ALREADY AVAILABLE FROM NASA MISSIONS (SDO) AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION (EBTEL AND HYDRAD)."

OUR PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVE OF THE EARTH SURFACE AND INTERIOR PROGRAMMATIC INTEREST: GEOPHYSICAL MODELS AND ANALYSIS SYSTEMS THAT ADVANCE REAL-TIME OR NEAR REAL-TIME GEODETIC PRODUCTS DERIVED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FROM ESTABLISHED INFRASTRUCTURE FOCUSED ON MITIGATION OF GEOHAZARDS. PROCESSING SPACE GEODESY OBSERVATIONS REQUIRES DATA REDUCTION FOR EARTH ROTATION THAT VARIES DUE TO 1) EXTERNAL TORQUES EXERTED BY THE MOON, SUN AND PLANETS, AND 2) MASS REDISTRIBUTION IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND HYDROSPHERE. PROCESSING DEDICATED VERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY (VLBI) OBSERVATIONS AS WELL AS OTHER SPACE GEODESY DATA ALLOWS US TO DETERMINE EOPS FOR THE PAST. HOWEVER, FOR PROCESSING REAL-TIME OR NEAR REAL TIME OBSERVATIONS THE EOPS FOR THE CURRENT INSTANT OF TIME ARE NOT AVAILABLE. THE ESSENCE OF OUR PROJECT ARE TWO ELEMENTS. FIRST, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR COMPUTATION OF THE ANGULAR MOMENT OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND HYDROSPHERE FROM THE FORECAST OF THE NASA GLOBAL MODELING AND ASSIMILATION OFFICE (GMAO) MODELS GEOSFP AND GEOS-FPIT THAT COVER THE TIME PERIOD FROM 2000.01.01 IN THE PAST THROUGH 24-36 HOURS IN THE FUTURE. USING ESTIMATES OF THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM, WE COMPUTE THE EARTH ORIENTATION PARAMETERS BY NUMERICAL INTEGRATION OF LIOUVILLE''S EQUATION STARTING FROM THE LATEST EOP MEASUREMENT TAKEN AS AN INITIAL VALUE. SECOND, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AN INTERNET SERVICE THAT WILL ALLOW A USER TO RETRIEVE THE EARTH''S ROTATION MATRIX AND ITS DERIVATIVES ANYTIME SINCE 1979.01.01 TO 24 HOURS IN THE FUTURE IN A TOTALLY AUTOMATIC FASHION USING THE OPENDAP PROTOCOL. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SUCH A SERVICE IS THAT ALL COMPLEXITY OF ACCURATE EOP PREDICTION ON THE BASIS OF NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS AND DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS WILL BE COMPLETELY CARRIED OUT BY THE REMOTE SERVER AND IT WILL NOT REQUIRE A HUMAN INTERVENTION. THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR REAL-TIME OR NEAR REAL-TIME SPACE GEODESY APPLICATIONS, ALTHOUGH NON REAL-TIME APPLICATIONS WILL BENEFIT FROM AUTOMATION AS WELL. IMPROVED ACCURACY OF EOP PREDICTION USING THE OUTPUT OF NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS WILL IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF SITE POSITION DETERMINATION, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR REAL-TIME OR NEAR REAL-TIME APPLICATIONS OF GNSS OBSERVATIONS FOR MONITORING STATION POSITIONS FOR DETECTION OF SEISMIC EVENTS AND PROVIDING HAZARD WARNINGS AND MITIGATION OF DAMAGE FROM EARTHQUAKES, VOLCANIC EVENTS, LANDSLIDES, OR TSUNAMI GENERATION.

ACCURACY OF NUMERICAL MODELS OVER LAND CAN BE EVALUATED BY COMPARISON WITH GROUND METEOROLOGICAL STATIONS, ATMOSPHERIC SOUNDINGS, AND WITH ESTIMATES OF PATH DELAY FROM SPACE GEODESY OBSERVATIONS.

IT ARISES BECAUSE THE FLUID CORE IS CONFINED WITHIN AN ELLIPSOIDAL MANTLE WHOSE ROTATION AND FIGURE AXES NEED NOT COINCIDE. IN THE TERRESTRIAL REFERENCE FRAME, THE ASSOCIATED MOTION IS A NEARLY DIURNAL FREE WOBBLE (NDFW). ANALYSIS OF THE FCN (OR THE NDFW) ALLOWS US TO STUDY CERTAIN UNIQUE PROPERTIES OF THE EARTH; A CLASSIC EXAMPLE (GWINN, 1986) WAS USING THE FCN TO DETERMINE THE ELLIPTICITY OF THE CORE-MANTLE BOUNDARY. OUR PROPOSAL AIMS TO IMPROVE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FCN EXCITATION AND DISSIPATION, AND THE GEOPHYSICAL INTERPRETATION OF FCN EFFECTS. AN IMPORTANT ASPECT IS TO IMPROVE THE MODELING OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE OBSERVED NUTATION, SINCE AN IMPROPER ACCOUNTING OF THESE CAN BIAS THE RESPONSE ESTIMATES. THE MAIN GOALS OF OUR STUDY ARE (A) TO OBTAIN IMPROVED AND SELF-CONSISTENT ESTIMATES OF COMPLIANCES THAT DESCRIBE THE RESPONSE OF THE NON-RIGID EARTH TO EXTERNAL TORQUES AND GEOPHYSICAL EXCITATIONS, ALONG WITH REALISTIC ERROR ESTIMATES; (B) TO CLOSE THE BUDGET OF THE EXCITATION AND DISSIPATION OF THE FCN OR TO ESTABLISH THAT THE BUDGET CANNOT BE CLOSED WITHIN UNCERTAINTIES OF GEODETIC OBSERVATIONS. OUR PRIMARY GEODETIC DATA WILL BE VERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY (VLBI) GROUP DELAYS. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY (1) INCORPORATING INTO OUR DATA ANALYSIS THE NON-GRAVITATIONAL FORCINGS FROM THE LATEST ADVANCED TIDAL AND NONTIDAL OCEANIC MODELS AND ATMOSPHERIC MODELS; (2) IMPROVING THE OCEAN TIDE MODEL AT PSI1 TIDE (CRITICAL BECAUSE ITS FREQUENCY IS SO CLOSE TO THE NDFW FREQUENCY); AND (3) ESTIMATING PARAMETERS OF THE NUTATION TRANSFER FUNCTION DIRECTLY FROM VLBI GROUP DELAYS WITHOUT RESORTING TO INTERMEDIATE TIME SERIES. IN PAST EFFORTS THE PSI1 OCEAN TIDE HAS NEVER BEEN HANDLED CORRECTLY. THIS IS BECAUSE, UNLIKE ANY OTHER TIDE, IT IS FORCED ABOUT EQUALLY BY THE GRAVITATIONAL TIDAL POTENTIAL AND BY RADIATIONAL EFFECTS OF THE ATMOSPHERIC TIDES. WE PROPOSE TO DETERMINE THE PSI1 BAROMETRIC PRESSURE TIDE FROM SEVERAL MODERN ANALYSES AND REANALYSES OF NUMERICAL WEATHER CENTERS. WE WILL BE GUIDED BY AN EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF BAROMETER MEASUREMENTS THAT WE HAVE BUILT UP OVER SEVERAL YEARS AND WHICH WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY USED TO STUDY THE S1 AND S2 AIR TIDES. WE WILL USE THE RESULTING AIR-TIDE MODEL TO FORCE A NUMERICAL OCEAN-TIDE MODEL THAT WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY USED TO STUDY THE S1 OCEAN TIDE. THE RESULTS, COMBINED WITH THE NOMINALLY EASIER GRAVITATIONAL PART, SHOULD RESULT IN A MUCH MORE REALISTIC MODEL OF THE PSI1 OCEAN TIDE THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO MITIGATE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS IN DETERMINING THE STRENGTH AND SHAPE OF THE FCN. WE WILL MODIFY THE WELL-KNOWN NEMO OCEAN MODEL TO COMPUTE OCEANIC ANGULAR MOMENTUM AND BOTTOM PRESSURE ON THE FLY AND TO STORE THESE DATA WITH A TIME RESOLUTION OF ONE HOUR. THE OCEAN DATA, COMBINED WITH PRESSURE AND WIND DATA FROM NUMERICAL WEATHER CENTERS, WILL SUPPLY NEW ANGULAR MOMENTUM CORRECTIONS FOR REANALYSIS OF VLBI NUTATION DATA, AGAIN LEADING TO BETTER DETERMINED FCN PARAMETERS. WE ANTICIPATE THE NEMO DATA WILL BENEFIT A WIDE RANGE OF EARTH SCIENCE STUDIES, NOT JUST OUR OWN. WE PROPOSE TO REANALYZE VLBI GROUP DELAYS FROM 1984 THROUGH PRESENT. WE WILL FIT PARAMETERS OF THE MODEL THAT RELATE THE OBSERVED SPECTRUM TO THE EXTERNAL GRAVITATIONAL EXCITATION EXERTED BY THE MOON, SUN, AND PLANETS AND TO INTERNAL EXCITATIONS CAUSED BY THE OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC DYNAMICS. THE PARAMETERS OF THE MODEL WILL INCLUDE COMPLIANCES SUCH AS DYNAMIC ELLIPTICITY OF THE WHOLE EARTH AND THE CORE, COMPLEX ELASTIC COMPLIANCES, COUPLING AT THE CORE-MANTLE BOUNDARY AND OTHER PARAMETERS. WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBILITY OF INCLUDING AD HOC EXCITATIONS TO EXPLAIN THE RESIDUAL SPECTRUM.

OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, AS RESOURCES PERMIT, WE HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING THE FEASIBILITY OF EXTRACTING FROM THE TWITTER DATA STREAM--WITHOUT ACTIVELY SOLICITING INPUTS-- USEFUL INFORMATION FOR APPLICATION TO NASA PRECIPITATION RESEARCH. THERE HAVE BEEN SIMILAR USES OF TWITTER AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA, MOSTLY RELATED TO NATURAL HAZARDS MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT, IN WHICH THE PARTICIPANTS KNOWINGLY AND ACTIVELY CONTRIBUTE. TWO EXAMPLES ARE THE SNOWTWEETS PROJECT (HTTP://SNOWCORE.UWATERLOO.CA/SNOWTWEETS/) AND METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA IDENTIFICATION NEAR THE GROUND (MPING; HTTP://MPING.NSSL.NOAA.GOV/). OTHER SUCH USES DEAL WITH EARTHQUAKES, VOLCANOES, AIR POLLUTION, ETC. BOTH CASES OF PASSIVE AND ACTIVE ENGAGEMENTS BY PARTICIPATING CITIZEN SCIENTISTS HOLD POTENTIAL FOR, E.G., AUGMENTING VALIDATION PROGRAMS OF NASA SATELLITE PRECIPITATION MISSIONS. IN THE PASSIVE CASE, WE HAVE EXPERIMENTED WITH LISTENING TO THE TWITTER STREAM FOR  RAIN  AND RELATED TWEETS, IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, AND MAPPING THEIR RESULTING DISTRIBUTION. OUR APPROACH SEEMS PROMISING FOR DEMONSTRATING NOT ONLY A UNIQUE APPLICATION OF TWITTER BUT ALSO A DEEPER POWER RESIDING WITHIN THE TWITTER DATA SET. THE TIME-VARYING SET OF  RAIN  TWEETS, E.G., CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS AN ORGANIC NETWORK OF RAIN GAUGES. ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO MORE FULLY ADDRESS INCLUDE (1) FILTERING FOR QUALITY TWEETS, (2) GEOLOCATION QUALITY, AND (3) IRREGULAR LOCATIONS OF TWEETS. IN THE ACTIVE CASE, WE HAVE CONDUCTED VERY PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS TO EVALUATE DIFFERENT METHODS OF ENGAGING WITH POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE REPLIED TO  RAIN  TWEETS WITH TRMM IMAGES GENERATED BY NASA GIOVANNI, CENTERED ON THE TWEET LOCATIONS. (FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE EXPERIMENT, OUR REPLIES ACTUALLY WERE DIRECTED TO A SPECIALLY CREATED TWITTER ACCOUNT OF OURS.) WE HAVE ALSO CONSIDERED USING ONLINE GAMES TO RECRUIT POTENTIAL ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS. WE BELIEVE OUR APPROACH, WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE PARTICIPANTS TO EXPLICITLY  SIGN UP  TO CONTRIBUTE AS CITIZEN SCIENTISTS, EVEN IN THE ACTIVE CASE, IS MORE ROBUST. PARTICIPANTS WHO ROUTINELY USE TWITTER WOULD CONTINUE TO DO SO. THE SCIENCE RATIONALE FOR MINING  RAIN  AND RELATED TWEETS IS TO POTENTIALLY OBTAIN A WIDESPREAD VIEW OF RAIN OCCURRENCE. ASSUMING THE TWEETS ARE OF REASONABLE QUALITY, THE TWO MAIN SCIENCE ISSUES ARE (1) THE RESULTS ARE MOSTLY ONLY QUALITATIVE (NO RAIN RATE INFORMATION) AND (2) THE RESULTS ARE ONLY POSITIVE (NO DIRECT NO-RAIN REPORTS), THOUGH THERE ARE POSSIBLE WAYS TO MITIGATE THESE ISSUES. CURRENTLY, THE RAIN/NO-RAIN BOUNDARY IS SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY, WHEN GAUGE STATIONS OR SATELLITE OVERPASSES ARE SPARSE.  RAIN TWEETS  COULD HELP CONSTRAIN THIS BOUNDARY. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH AN APPLICATION OF TWITTER WOULD TAKE PLACE MAINLY IN THE U.S., WHERE THERE IS A HIGH DENSITY OF DATA. ACTUAL APPLICATIONS WOULD BE MOSTLY OUTSIDE THE U.S., BECAUSE, IN MANY OF THOSE REGIONS, THE RELEVANT MEASUREMENTS ARE FREQUENTLY SPARSE, INACCESSIBLE, OR NON-EXISTENT. OUR PROPOSED PROJECT GOAL IS TO MINE THE TWITTER DATABASE TO AUGMENT THE VALIDATION PROGRAM OF THE NASA GLOBAL PRECIPITATION MEASUREMENT (GPM) MISSION.

THIS IMAGING SYSTEM WOULD BE EXPECTED TO BE LESS THAN 10 POUNDS WITH A TOTAL SIZE AS A SHOE BOX. THE SAMPLE COULD BE EITHER ICE OR ROCK. THE COMPACT X-RAY IMAGING SYSTEM HAS A SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL TO BE USEFUL FOR NASA S NEW FRONTIERS AND DISCOVERY MISSIONS CROSS MOST PLANETARY BODIES. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL INNOVATION IS FROM THREE ASPECTS 1. TO LEVERAGES THE RAPID PROGRESS IN X-RAY SOURCE AND X-RAY IMAGING SENSOR FOR BUILDING A COMPACT AND EFFICIENT SYSTEM. TO USE A HYBRID OPTIC SYSTEM TO GET MULTIPLE MONOCHROMATIC AND POLYCHROMATIC BEAMS FOR ENHANCING THE SYSTEM EFFICIENCY AND CAPABILITY IN DATA COLLECTION. 2. TO COMBINE THE BEAM SYSTEM WITH AN INNOVATIVE SCAN MECHANISM FOR YIELDING THE 3D MULTI-SPECTRAL IMAGES WITH RICH INFORMATION ABOUT THE SAMPLES. 3. FURTHERMORE, THIS PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY COULD BE COMBINED WITH OTHER INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS THE MARS CHEMIN SYSTEM, TO FORM A SYNERGY OF THE DUAL/TRIPLE MODALITY. THE PROCESS COULD BE: FIRST TO PERFORM THE NON-DESTRUCTIVE MULTI-SPECTRAL 3D CT IMAGING WITH THE SAMPLES, AND THEN DO THE X-RAY DIFFRACTION (XRD) AND X-RAY FLUORESCENCE (XRF) MEASUREMENTS AFTER THE SAMPLES TO BE GROUNDED TO POWDER. THE SYNERGY WILL YIELD A GREAT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION, SUCH AS DENSITY, POROSITY, CRACK, PHASE COMPOSITION, ETC, AS WELL AS THE CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS, AND TRACE ELEMENTS ETC. OF THE SAMPLES.

IT IS HARD IN THIS EXPLANATION TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE SLOW WIND OCCUPIES SO MUCH SPACE IN THE HELIOSPHERE. PSEUDOSTREAMERS ARE MULTIPOLAR FEATURES WHICH DEVELOP INTO FIELDS THAT ARE UNIPOLAR AT GREATER HEIGHTS.  THERE IS DEBATE AS TO THE SPEED AND NATURE OF THE WIND FROM PSEUDOSTREAMERS: IT COULD BE FAST, SLOW, OR IN BETWEEN. AND, IN GENERAL, THEY MIGHT FORM A NETWORK OF SLOW WIND WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT CONNECT IN THE HELIOSPHERE TO SLOW WIND COMING FROM AROUND THE HELIOSPHERIC CURRENT SHEET.  DIFFERENT TYPES OF PSEUDOSTREAMERS EXIST, WITH A COMPLEX INNER STRUCTURE WHICH DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER OF POLARITIES EMBEDDED IN THE CLOSED REGIONS BELOW. IN ADDITION PSEUDOSTREAMERS MAY ALSO HARBOR FILAMENT CHANNELS, OFTEN OCCURRING IN PAIRS (TWIN FILAMENT CHANNELS). IN THE LATTER CASE, THE STRONGLY SHEARED FIELD OF THE CHANNEL MAGNETIC STRUCTURES AND THE SKEW OF THE CORONAL ARCADE ABOVE THE CHANNELS DICTATE THE WAY THE CORONAL FIELD EXPANDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF PSEUDOSTREAMERS.

WE WILL FOLLOW FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF THE LOW-LATITUDE CORONAL HOLE FROM DECAYING ACTIVE REGIONS IN WHICH PSEUDOSTREAMERS ARE EMBEDDED, STUDY CORONAL CELLS AND FILAMENTS TOPOLOGY AT THE PSEUDOSTREAMER BASES TO DETERMINE THE DIRECTION OF THE TANGENTIAL FIELDS AND CURRENTS IN THE PSEUDOSTREAMER BASES.

While high bypass ratio turbofans brought significant improvements to aircraft propulsion, the future will require the use of a different propulsion technology. Turbo-electric propulsion shows great potential to address all the N+3 objectives through the use of electrically driven fans allowing for distributed propulsion. Turbofans are replaced in this approach by ducted fans driven by high power density electric motors. The electrical power is generated by a gas turbine coupled to a high speed, high power density generator. However, the turbo-electric propulsion concept relies on the availability of electric machines with power densities (kW/m3) and specific power (kW/kg) far larger than that of conventional electric machines. Fully superconducting rotating machines have the potential to match the requirements of turbo-electric propulsion and present enabling technology for this application. Superconducting machines require operation at cryogenic temperature that can be achieved by using closed-cycle cryocoolers or liquid cryogen flow such as liquid hydrogen (LH2) that could also be used as energy carrier for propulsion. The development of turbo-electric propulsion for aircrafts requires accurate sizing of superconducting machines and performing the pertinent trade-off analysis to determine the optimum materials and operating temperature. NASA is currently using sizing models for superconducting machines developed by Dr. and his colleagues. These models were developed as part of the NASA URETI on Aeropropulsion Power and Technology (UAPT) and at the Advanced Magnet Lab (AML). The existing models are based on analytical modeling of electric machines published by Miller and Hughes and estimates of the mass of the different components of the machines assuming a given active length. Important AC loss calculations in this model are based on experimental data available in the literature AC losses in superconducting stators are very challenging to estimate as the rotating field from the rotor is phase shifted relative to the phase current which depends on the angular stator position. Furthermore, the magnitude of the applied field is not uniformly distributed, and the armature reaction tends to demagnetize the machine impacting the AC losses. While the outstanding potential of the turbo-electric propulsion has been successfully demonstrated through a few projects, higher fidelity models are needed to perform a more accurate assessment at the system level. AML proposes to develop the next generation of sizing model based on a complete 3D analysis of superconducting machines using semi-analytical methods to calculate the magnetic flux density distribution including all components of the machine. The model will include all relevant areas of design including electromagnetics, thermodynamics and mechanics. Based on semi-analytical methods, the model will enable rapid calculations as needed for system optimization. The model to be developed will be fully validated, first numerically using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and finally experimentally using a superconducting machine developed at AML. Some aspects of fully superconducting machines including the AC losses and the fault behavior have not been sufficiently studied in the past to build reliable models. We therefore propose to focus the experimental validation on those important aspects: The proposed physics-based model will allow to design and optimize aircrafts based on turbo-electric propulsion, which is the first step towards the development of the next generation of more efficient aircrafts with reduced toxic emissions and noise pollution. Such aircrafts would also allow take-off and landing during the night in cities and would dramatically reduce the cost of operation and maintenance."

THIS PROPOSAL DESCRIBES HOW THE SPATIALLY COHERENT OPTICAL VIBROMETER ARRAY (SCOVA), COMBINED WITH CHIRPED ULTRASOUND EXCITATION AND NARROW TONE-BAND DECOMPOSITION PROVIDE DEEP DATA SETS FOR APPLICATION OF NEW SPATIO-TEMPORAL AND SPATIO-SPECTRAL ANALYSES TO ADDRESS A BROAD RANGE OF NDE FUNCTIONS PERTINENT TO NASA SPACEFLIGHT STRUCTURES. IN FORM AND FUNCTION, SCOVA OFFERS A SENSOR GEARED TOWARDS PRACTICAL DEPLOYMENT OF GUIDED WAVE NDE. THE ABILITY OF SCOVA TO CAPTURE SWEPT ULTRASOUND DATA AT HUNDREDS OF POINTS SIMULTANEOUSLY, OFFERS A MAJOR ADVANCEMENT IN THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF GUIDED WAVE NDE TARGETING MULTIPLE DEFECT MODALITIES IN CURRENT AND FUTURE COMPLEX SPACEFLIGHT STRUCTURES."

ADVANCED SYSTEMS&TECHNOLOGIES INC. PROPOSES AN OPTICAL NON-CONTACT SENSOR FUSION CONCEPT WHICH, FOR THE FIRST TIME, ENABLES DIRECT CAPTURE AND OBSERVATION OF FULL-FIELD NONSTATIONARY DYNAMIC STRUCTURAL VIBRATIONS (SV) AND UNSTEADY RADIATED SOUND FIELDS OR TRANSIENT FLOW FIELDS AROUND THE STRUCTURE OF INTEREST. SV DEPICT THE FLOW OF ENERGY IN A STRUCTURE AND PROVIDES AN UNAMBIGUOUS IDENTIFICATION OF STRUCTURAL NOISE SOURCES AND SINKS. ADDITIONALLY, THE ABILITY TO CAPTURE AND CORRELATE THE ACOUSTIC/FLOW FIELD DATA WITH THE STRUCTURE BORNE INTENSITY, OFFERS AN UNPRECEDENTED AND RAPID DIAGNOSTIC CAPABILITY FOR NOISE SOURCE CHARACTERIZATION AND EVALUATION OF NOISE ABATEMENT SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION TO BEING NON-INTRUSIVE THE MEASUREMENTS ARE FAST, CAN BE MADE AT OPERATIONALLY RELEVANT BANDWIDTHS, WHICH EXTEND TO THE ULTRASONIC DOMAIN, AND PROVIDE DEEPER INSIGHT INTO THE COMPLEX STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS WHICH ARE THE ROOT CAUSE OF NOISE EMISSION."

THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO ADDRESS FOUR MAJOR QUESTIONS: - HOW IS THE LOCAL CYCLE OF WATER (AND DUST) CONTROLLED AT SITES OBSERVED BY CRISM/MCS/MARCI? - CAN SUCH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTROLS ON SURFACE WATER EXCHANGE BE SUMMARIZED INTO A PROGNOSTIC FRAMEWORK LIKE A LAND SURFACE MODEL (LSM) IN TERRESTRIAL STUDIES? - HOW IS THE GLOBAL CYCLE OF WATER AND DUST CHANGED IF BETTER REPRESENTATIONS OF THE POLAR EXCHANGE PROCESSES ARE INCLUDED IN GLOBAL MODELS? - CAN THE SEASONAL PROGNOSTIC PICTURE OF ICE AND DUST DEPOSITION AT THE POLES BE USED TO HELP UNDERSTAND THE FORMATION OF POLAR LAYERED TERRAIN? THE LATTER QUESTION SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE MDAP CALL REGARDING \""NONDATA-ANALYSIS TASKS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE USE OR FACILITATE THE INTERPRETATION OF MISSION DATA\"" AS IT ALLOWS DATA ON CURRENT PROCESSES TO BE USED TO ADDRESS LONGER-TERM QUESTIONS IN MARTIAN CLIMATE DYNAMICS AND GEOLOGY. THE WATER CYCLE IS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE MARTIAN CLIMATE SYSTEM, YIELDING A SIGNIFICANT FEEDBACK ON THE CLIMATE THROUGH ITS EFFECTS ON SURFACE ALBEDO VIA FORMATION OF ICES AND ON ATMOSPHERIC EMISSIVITY AND REFLECTIVITY VIA CLOUDS. CLOUDS ALSO INTERACT WITH THE ATMOSPHERIC DUST DISTRIBUTION VIA THE MICROPHYSICS OF CLOUD PARTICLE EVOLUTION, YIELDING ADDITIONAL MODIFICATION OF ATMOSPHERIC RADIATIVE FORCING. WHILE THE MAJOR PROCESSES OF THE WATER CYCLE, AND ITS INTERACTIONS WITH THE DUST AND CO2 CYCLES, HAVE BEEN SKETCHED IN OUTLINE FOR SEVERAL DECADES, THE SPECIFICS OF HOW THE WATER CYCLE IS CONTROLLED REMAIN UNCERTAIN, E.G. THE IMPORTANCE OF REGOLITH EXCHANGE. THE NATURE OF THE NORTHERN CAP AS A DOMINANT WATER SOURCE AND THAT OF BOTH THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH AS SINKS AGAIN SEEMS CERTAIN IN OUTLINE, BUT THE DETAILS OF HOW THESE SOURCES AND SINKS FUNCTION HAS NOT RECEIVED MUCH ATTENTION AND MAY DOMINATE THE EFFICACY OF HOW THE WATER (AND RELATED CLIMATE) CYCLES ARE CONTROLLED GLOBALLY. CRISM DATA SUGGEST SIGNIFICANT LOCAL CYCLING AND IN SOME CASES BURIAL OF ANNUAL WATER LAYERS, WHICH IS LIKELY THE BASIS FOR POLAR LAYER FORMATION, AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHICH WOULD BE KEY TO UNRAVELING THE RECORD OF CLIMATE STORED IN THESE LAYERS. WE PROPOSE TO USE THE PLANETWRF MODELING SYSTEM TO UNDERTAKE IDEALIZED LOCAL THERMAL / WATER EXCHANGE MODELING OF SPECIFIC SITES OBSERVED BY CRISM, TO UNDERTAKE RESOLVED-SCALE SEASONAL MODELING OF THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CAPS, AND TO UNDERTAKE MULTI-ANNUAL MODELING OF THE CLIMATE SYSTEM USING LSM SCHEMES DEVELOPED WITHIN THIS PROJECT. NEW DATA PRODUCTS FROM CRISM WILL BE DEVELOPED AS NEEDED WITHIN THE ANALYSIS. THIS PROPOSAL IS RELEVANT TO THE MARS DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAM AS IT SEEKS TO UNDERTAKE WORK NECESSARY FOR THE ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF MARS SPACECRAFT MISSION DATA AND WILL HEAVILY USE MISSION DATA IN THE GENERATION OF IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF THE MARTIAN CLIMATE SYSTEM. IT WILL ALSO IMPROVE ATMOSPHERIC MODELS THAT FURTHER THE UNDERSTANDING AND FORECASTING OF ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT SAFE PASSAGE OF SPACECRAFT THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE.

THE INVESTIGATION PROPOSED HERE WILL GAIN INSIGHT BY DIRECT ANALYSIS OF THE DATASET, COMPARISON WITH NUMERICAL MODELING (BY MESOSCALE AND LARGE EDDY SIMULATION) OF THE LANDING SITE ATMOSPHERE, AND COMPARISON WITH MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY (MSL) ATMOSPHERIC DATA. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF WEATHER, DUST DEVIL ACTIVITY, AND AEOLIAN PROCESSES ON MARS VIA THE ANALYSIS OF INSIGHT MEASUREMENTS AND THEIR COMPARISON WITH ATMOSPHERIC MODEL PREDICTIONS. THIS GOAL IS ADDRESSED THROUGH FOUR, INTERRELATED INVESTIGATIONS: 1. DETERMINE THE CONTROLS ON THE DIURNAL AND SEASONAL PRESSURE CYCLE. HAVING ATMOSPHERIC DATA AT TWO LOCATIONS (MSL AND INSIGHT) IS VERY VALUABLE. MSL IS AT A SIMILAR LONGITUDE AND ONLY 9DEG AWAY IN LATITUDE, BUT WITH VERY DIFFERENT LOCAL TOPOGRAPHY AND IN THE OPPOSITE HEMISPHERE, HENCE REGULAR MSL PRESSURE MONITORING MAY BE COMBINED WITH CONTINUOUS INSIGHT MONITORING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF DIFFERENT CIRCULATION COMPONENTS (FROM THE CO2 CYCLE AND HADLEY CELL TO TIDES AND TRAVELING WAVES TO CRATER TOPOGRAPHY) TO THE SEASONAL AND DIURNAL PRESSURE CYCLES. 2. UNDERSTAND REGIONAL FLOWS NEAR THE DICHOTOMY BOUNDARY. ALTHOUGH MSL''S WIND SENSOR IS NO LONGER IN USE, THE SEASONAL RECORD OF WINDS IN GALE WILL BE COMPARED WITH INSIGHT WINDS TO BUILD A BETTER PICTURE OF THE REGIONAL FLOW IN THIS AREA. COMPARISON WITH MODELS WILL BE USED TO ASSESS THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE HADLEY OVERTURNING CIRCULATION, DICHOTOMY BOUNDARY SLOPE FLOWS, TIDAL FLOWS, ETC. TO THE PATTERN OF WINDS IN THIS REGION. 3. UNDERSTAND VORTEX ACTIVITY. SHORT, DEEP PRESSURE DROPS WILL BE USED TO INDICATE CONVECTIVE VORTEX PASSAGE. THEIR DEPENDENCE ON TIME OF DAY AND SEASON ARE IMPORTANT FOR CONSTRAINING OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE BOUNDARY LAYER WHERE THEY FORM AND ALSO VITAL TO UNDERSTAND A MAJOR MECHANISM OF DUST LIFTING. AN IN SITU DATASET OF BOTH VORTICES AND THE ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS IN WHICH THEY FORMED, AT ONE LOCATION OVER MULTIPLE SEASONS, WILL BE INVALUABLE BOTH FOR UNDERSTANDING THEIR DEPENDENCE ON ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS AND FOR VALIDATING MODELS AND THEORIES OF VORTEX PRODUCTION AND DUST DEVIL-BASED DUST LIFTING. BOTH MESOSCALE AND LES MODELING WILL BE USED TO PREDICT VORTEX ACTIVITY, WITH A COMPARISON WITH OBSERVATIONS USED TO INDICATE DEFICIENCIES IN THE MODELS OR THEORY. 4. MONITOR AEOLIAN ACTIVITY AND INFER THRESHOLDS FOR PARTICLE MOTION. WIND DATA WILL BE COMPARED WITH A) TEMPORAL CHANGES IN AEOLIAN FEATURES AND B) CHANGES IN SURFACE SOIL, DECK, OR SOLAR PANEL DUST COVER BETWEEN TWO IMAGES, IN ORDER TO INFER PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT, SUCH AS THE THRESHOLD FOR SALTATION. AEOLIAN FEATURE CHARACTERISTICS WILL ALSO BE PREDICTED USING WIND DATA AND MODEL OUTPUT AND COMPARED WITH OBSERVATIONS TO ASSESS AEOLIAN THEORY AND MODEL PERFORMANCE. THE PI HAS SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE IN WORKING ON SUCH INVESTIGATIONS AS A MEMBER OF THE MSL SCIENCE TEAM [E.G. BRIDGES ET AL., 2017]. THE PI WILL PARTICIPATE STRONGLY IN THE ATMOSPHERE THEME GROUP, AS SHE DOES IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL THEME GROUP ON MSL, AND ALSO IN THE GEOLOGY THEME GROUP, TO E.G. HELP INTERPRET / DISSEMINATE METEOROLOGICAL DATA AND PROVIDE INPUT INTO WHEN HIGHER RESOLUTION DATA SHOULD BE SOUGHT.

IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE PROPOSE TO USE ADVANCES IN COMPUTING POWER AND MODEL DEVELOPMENT TO EMPLOY NESTED SYNOPTIC-TO-MESOSCALE MODELING OF CLOUD SYSTEMS AND MOIST CONVECTION USING MASSIVELY PARALLEL COMPUTING.

HOWEVER, REAL ATMOSPHERES ARE COMPLICATED BY THREE-DIMENSIONAL PROCESSES, NON-LINEAR INTERACTIONS, AND NUMEROUS FEEDBACKS. THREE-DIMENSIONAL GENERAL CIRCULATION MODELS (GCMS) PROVIDE AN INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK FOR CAPTURING THE LINEAR AND NON-LINEAR INTERACTIONS OF A WIDE RANGE OF PROCESSES, AND ARE THUS REQUIRED TO TEST AND FURTHER DEVELOP HYPOTHESES, TO STUDY THE COMPLETE ATMOSPHERIC SYSTEM, AND TO SIMULATE (AND EVENTUALLY PREDICT) ALL ASPECTS OF THE TIME-VARYING 3D ATMOSPHERE.

PREVIOUS STATE OF THE ART REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE ISS RFR, USE THERMOELECTRIC THERMAL CONTROL WITH VERY LOW OVERALL SYSTEM COP OF AROUND 0.36 (IN FREEZER MODE). ALTERNATIVELY, TERRESTRIAL COLD FOOD STORAGE SYSTEMS UTILIZE MUCH MORE EFFICIENT VAPOR COMPRESSION THERMAL CONTROL SYSTEMS, MAKING THE SYSTEMS LIGHTER AND MORE COMPACT. CURRENTLY, THESE SYSTEMS DO NOT HAVE PROVISIONS TO FULFILL THE LOAD AND RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS OF SPACE APPLICATIONS AND ARE ALSO NOT DESIGNED FOR MICROGRAVITY OPERATION. AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE KELVINATOR KCCF220QW CHEST FREEZER. THIS FREEZER CAN MAINTAIN TEMPERATURES AS LOW AS 26 C AT COPS OF AROUND 2.2 TO 2.4. AIR SQUARED IS PROPOSING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A ZERO-GRAVITY VAPOR COMPRESSION REFRIGERATOR (ZVCR). THE ZVCR IS AN OIL-FREE, SCROLL DRIVEN, VAPOR COMPRESSION FOOD STORAGE SYSTEM THAT IS THERMALLY EFFICIENT, LIGHTWEIGHT AND RELIABLE. SIMILAR TO CONVENTIONAL SYSTEMS, THE ZVCR WILL INCLUDE FOUR MAJOR COMPONENTS: COMPRESSOR, CONDENSER, EXPANSION DEVICE AND EVAPORATOR.

DUE TO THE SPINNING MOTION OF THE PUMP, VARIOUS CENTRIFUGAL LOADS ARE ELIMINATED ALLOWING SPEEDS OVER 8,000 RPM POSSIBLE AND MAKING THE DESIGN COMPACT AND LIGHTWEIGHT.

HOWEVER, THEY CAN\'T ACHIEVE SPEEDS OVER 3,000 RPM WITHOUT BULKY AND HIGH-LOAD BEARINGS. THIS TYPICALLY MAKES POSITIVE DISPLACEMENT PUMPS LARGER, AND CONSEQUENTLY, LESS DESIRABLE FOR AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS. THE CSSP OFFERS THE BEST OF BOTH OPTIONS. AS A POSITIVE DISPLACEMENT PUMP, IT CAN ACHIEVE HIGH-PRESSURE WITH MINIMAL REDUCTION IN FLOW AND PUMP SATURATED LIQUIDS AT LOW NET-POSITIVE SUCTION HEADS. DUE TO THE SPINNING MOTION OF THE PUMP VARIOUS CENTRIFUGAL LOADS ARE ELIMINATED, WITH REDUCED LOADING, SPEEDS OVER 8,000 RPM ARE POSSIBLE, MAKING THE DESIGN COMPACT AND LIGHTWEIGHT. ADDITIONALLY, THE SPINNING MOTION OF THE SCROLLS ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR A COUNTERBALANCE COMMON IN ORBITING SCROLL DESIGNS. THIS FURTHER REDUCES WEIGHT BY ELIMINATING COUNTERWEIGHTS AND EASES BEARING LOADS. AIR SQUARED BELIEVES THE PROPOSED CSSP IS A PERFECT FIT IN SUPPORT OF METHANE IN-SPACE PROPULSION."

COMPLETED STUDIES ON EACH APPROACH, HAVE GENERALLY FAVORED CRYOGENIC TEMPERATURE AND MECHANICAL COMPRESSION SOLUTIONS. RECENTLY, MECHANICAL COMPRESSION HAS GAINED MOMENTUM THROUGH THE MARS OXYGEN ISRU EXPERIMENT (MOXIE), WHICH UTILIZES AN AIR SQUARED COMPRESSOR FOR MECHANICAL COMPRESSION OF CO2. IF THIS APPROACH IS PURSUED FURTHER FOR A LARGER SYSTEM, THERE ARE STILL SEVERAL QUESTIONS CONCERNING RELIABILITY OVER 10,000 HOURS OF AUTONOMOUS OPERATION IN MARS ENVIRONMENT AND SCALABILITY. AIR SQUARED PLANS ON ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES AS PART OF PHASE I. AIR SQUARED PROPOSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTI-STAGE SCROLL COMPRESSOR (MSSC) THAT WILL BE CONFIGURED TO SUPPORT A STORE-AND-UTILIZE STRATEGY (HIGH PRESSURE) OR A COLLECTION-ONLY STRATEGY (HIGH FLOW). IF A STORE-AND-UTILIZE APPROACH IS REQUIRED, THE MSSC WILL BE SET UP TO PRESSURIZE THE GAS OVER THE TRIPLE POINT (>77 PSIA), WHICH PROVIDES THE ABILITY TO LIQUEFY CO2 DOWNSTREAM OF THE MSSC AS IT COOLS, WHILE N2 AND AR REMAIN A GAS. IF ONLY COLLECTION IS NECESSARY, THE MSSC WILL BE CONFIGURED TO MAXIMIZE FLOW AT A PRESSURE ABOVE 15 PSIA. THERE WILL BE TWO ?TYPES? OF MSSCS PURSUED DURING THE PHASE I, AN ORBITING AND SPINNING MSSC. THE ORBITING MSSC HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF LONGER DESIGN HERITAGE AND LOWERS ASSOCIATED RISK, AS THIS SCROLL CONFIGURATION IS WIDELY USED AT AIR SQUARED AND THE COMPRESSOR INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. THE SPINNING MSSC HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF ACHIEVING AN AGGRESSIVE SIZE AND WEIGHT TARGET BUT HAS LITTLE DESIGN HERITAGE. THE ORBITING MSSC AND SPINNING MSSC BOTH HAVE SUBSTANTIAL ADVANCEMENT OVER STATE OF THE ART MECHANICAL COMPRESSION TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS HIGH-SPEED TURBO-COMPRESSORS. SIZE, WEIGHT, AND POWER REQUIREMENTS ARE ALL REDUCED. RELIABILITY IS ALSO IMPROVED, AS BOTH MSSCS OPERATE AT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SPEEDS THAN TURBO-COMPRESSORS."

HOWEVER, THESE SOLUTIONS ARE EITHER ONE-OFF IMPLEMENTATIONS OR IMPLEMENTED FOR SPECIFIC COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS, OR BOTH, AND THUS DO NOT HAVE THE BROAD APPLICABILITY THAT A GENERAL HDF5 SOLUTION WOULD HAVE. WITH ITS PROVEN RECORD FOR SCALABILITY, HDF5 IS THE DATA STORE OF CHOICE FOR MANY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT APPLICATIONS AT NASA, THE DOE, AND OTHER HIGH-END COMPUTING (HEC) FACILITIES. THUS, AN HDF5 BASED SOLUTION WOULD BECOME AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY, WITH MINIMAL MODIFICATION, TO MANY EXISTING APPLICATIONS, AND WOULD BE EXTREMELY EASY TO ADAPT IN SUPPORT OF FUTURE APPLICATIONS. H5 HERMES DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE OBJECTIVES OF THE SOLICITATION.

TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS ARE A DOMINANT SOURCE OF C TO INLAND WATERS THROUGH SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE NETWORKS.

SOURCE, ROUTING, AND RESIDENCE TIME ARE IMPERATIVE TO UNDERSTANDING C DYNAMICS IN INLAND WATERS. WE WILL DETERMINE C SOURCE AND AGE THROUGH ANALYSES OF THE 14C CONTENT OF INORGANIC AND ORGANIC C SPECIES AND C-GAS EMISSIONS. MOLECULAR BIOMARKERS, COUPLED WITH MEASURED OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF DOC WILL INFORM ON TERRESTRIAL VERSUS AUTOCHTHONOUS SOURCES OF AQUATIC C AND ON ITS POTENTIAL FOR MINERALIZATION BY BIOLOGICAL OR PHOTO- DEGRADATION. MUCH OF TERRESTRIALLY-DERIVED AQUATIC C IS DEGRADED BEFORE REACHING SURFACE WATERS, SO HYDROLOGIC MODELING OF RESIDENCE TIMES WILL IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE AND WHEN INLAND WATER C-GAS EMISSIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE GREATEST.

THE ASTROBIOLOGY ROADMAP (DES MARAIS ET AL. 2008) LISTS UNDERSTANDING HOW HABITABLE PLANETS ACQUIRE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS AND HOW ORGANIC COMPOUNDS ARE ASSEMBLED INTO MORE COMPLEX MOLECULAR STRUCTURES AS IMPORTANT RESEARCH OBJECTIVES. ADDITIONALLY, DELIVERY AND PRESERVATION OF ORGANIC MOLECULES, VOLATILES, AND WATER WERE HIGHLIGHTED IN TWO SCIENCE INITIATIVES AT THE NAI STRATEGIC SCIENCE INITIATIVE WORKSHOP IN TEMPE, AZ (MAY 2009). THOUGH WE KNOW THAT ORGANIC MOLECULES ARE ABUNDANT IN METEORITES, COMETS, AND INTERPLANETARY DUST PARTICLES, FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED HOW IMPACT PROCESSES AFFECT THEIR CHEMISTRY AND SURVIVABILITY UNDER EXTREME TEMPERATURES AND PRESSURES. THIS STUDY PROPOSES TO EXAMINE HOW IMPACT EVENTS MAY CHANGE THE STRUCTURE OF THE SIMPLEST SUGARS, GLYCOLALDEHYDE AND DIHYDROXYACETONE, TWO MOLECULES THAT HAVE BEEN DETECTED IN INTERSTELLAR CLOUDS AND METEORITES, RESPECTIVELY. WE WILL ALSO STUDY HOW THESE IMPACTS AFFECT SUGARS EMBEDDED IN ICE AND MINERAL MATRICES, AS ANALOGS TO COMETS AND METEORITES. WE WILL USE THE FLAT-PLATE ACCELERATOR AT THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER EXPERIMENTAL IMPACT LABORATORY TO INVESTIGATE HOW THESE SUGARS REACT UNDER THE EXTREME PRESSURES AND TEMPERATURES OF SIMULATED TERRESTRIAL IMPACT EVENTS. SHOCKED SOLUTIONS WILL BE ANALYZED BY LC/MS, GC/MS, NMR, AND MALDI-TOFMS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER AND IDENTITY OF THE SPECIES IN THE MIXTURES AND THEN COMPARED TO ANALYSES OF UNREACTED MIXTURES. IT IS LIKELY THAT UNDER THE EXTREME CONDITIONS OF THE SIMULATED IMPACT EVENTS THE SUGARS IN SOLUTION WILL FORM MORE COMPLEX MOLECULES, SUCH AS THREOSE (FORMED FROM THE DIMERIZATION OF GLYCOLALDEHYDE) OR FRUCTOSE (FORMED FROM THE DIMERIZATION OF DIHYDROXYACETONE). THIS OUTCOME WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT TO UNDERSTANDING THE DELIVERY AND SUBSEQUENT SHOCK CHEMISTRY OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOMOLECULES BECAUSE IT WOULD SHOW THAT THESE MOLECULES COULD SURVIVE IMPACT EVENTS TO FORM MORE COMPLEX MOLECULES."

IMPORTANTLY, THEY CAN ALSO BE USED TO ADDRESS THE PERSISTENT QUESTION OF THE NATURE OF THE LUNAR IMPACT FLUX. THIS PROJECT INVOLVES ANALYZING IMPACT GLASSES FROM SELECTED APOLLO 14, 15, 16, AND 17 REGOLITH SAMPLES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE MORE DATA THAT CAN BE USED TO EVALUATE THE NATURE OF THE LUNAR IMPACT FLUX. DECIPHERING THE LUNAR IMPACT HISTORY IS A COMPLEX PROCESS AND MANY TYPES OF SAMPLES ARE BEING STUDIED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. LUNAR IMPACT GLASSES ARE NUMEROUS; THEIR COMPOSITIONS TELL US WHERE THEY WERE FORMED, WHILE THEIR 40AR/39AR AGES TELL US WHEN THEY WERE FORMED. THUS, LUNAR IMPACT GLASSES CAN PROVIDE USEFUL INSIGHT INTO THE IMPACT RATE IN THE EARTH-MOON SYSTEM. HUNDREDS OF LUNAR IMPACT GLASSES HAVE BEEN SELECTED FROM SAMPLES 14259, 15221, 64501, 66041, AND 71501. COMPOSITIONS AND AGES OF THESE GLASSES CAN BE USED TO CONSTRAIN THE TIMING OF THE LUNAR IMPACT FLUX. METHODOLOGY: MAJOR- AND TRACE-ELEMENT ANALYSES ON THE LUNAR GLASS SAMPLES WILL BE DONE BY ELECTRON MICROPROBE AND LASER ABLATION ICPMS, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE THE ARGON ISOTOPES WILL BE MEASURED BY THE THERMO ARGUS VI MULTI-COLLECTOR NOBLE GAS MASS SPECTROMETER AT CURTIN UNIVERSITY. THIS STATE-OF-THE-ART INSTRUMENT HAS HIGH SENSITIVITY AND IS PARTICULARLY WELL-SUITED FOR ISOTOPIC ANALYSES OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF ARGON. WE WILL THEN COMPARE OUR NEW RESULTS TO EXISTING DATA, WITH THE GOAL OF ADDING TO THE 40AR/39AR DATA SETS OF LUNAR SAMPLE AGES IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF LUNAR IMPACTS OVER TIME. RELEVANCE: LUNAR GLASSES PROVIDE COMPOSITIONAL INFORMATION, WHICH IS USEFUL FOR CHARACTERIZING THE CHEMICAL AND MINERALOGICAL FEATURES OF THE LUNAR SURFACE. AGES OF IMPACT GLASSES CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT RATE IN THE EARTH-MOON SYSTEM (AND PERHAPS THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM), A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IN LUNAR SCIENCE. RESULTS FROM THESE STUDIES WILL ELUCIDATE THE EVOLUTION AND MODIFICATION OF THE LUNAR SURFACE AND ADDRESS THE NATURE OF THE LUNAR IMPACT FLUX. THESE TASKS WILL LEAD TO RESULTS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW OBJECTS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM HAVE EVOLVED."

HOWEVER, CURRENT MATERIAL SYSTEMS CAN ONLY OFFER LIMITED TEMPERATURE CAPABILITY (<3000  F) AND MOSTLY FOR SINGLE USE APPLICATION. IN PHASE I, TWO INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, UNDERCOAT AND FGM MULTI-LAYER COATS, WERE DEVELOPED AND SCREENED. THEY WERE FURTHER INTEGRATED INTO TWO SOTA C-C COMPOSITES. OXIDATION PROTECTED C-C SAMPLES WERE TORCH TESTED AT 3500 F/ 30 MINUTES, AT 4200 F/ 2 MINUTES UP TO 10 CYCLES, AND AT 3000 F/COOL/ 4000 F CYCLES SHOWING VERY PROMISING RESULTS. THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF THE UNDERCOAT AND FGM SPRAY COATS PROVIDE REPEATABLE PERFORMANCE BY CREATING A GLASS FORMING, CONFORMING AND ADHERENT EXTERNAL COATING TO PROTECT THE C-C FROM BEING OXIDIZED. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED P-II IS TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND OPTIMIZE A ROBUST, TAILORABLE, AND AFFORDABLE OXIDATION PROTECTION SYSTEM FOR C-C TPS AND C-C HOT STRUCTURE BY INTEGRATING OUR UNDERCOAT AND FGM MULTI-LAYER SPRAY COAT TECHNOLOGIES INTO AT LEAST TWO GRADES C-C COMPOSITES (T300 AND P30 2D C-C) MEETING HIGHER TEMPERATURE PERFORMANCE UP TO 4500 F AND MULTI-USE APPLICATIONS. WORK PLAN INCLUDES 12 TASKS OVER 24 MONTH GROUPED INTO 5 CATEGORIES. ONCE FURTHER OPTIMIZED AND VALIDATED UNDER PHASE II, THESE TECHNOLOGIES CAN EASILY BE INTEGRATED INTO SOTA C-C USING CURRENT MANUFACTURING FACILITIES.

IN ADDITION, THE INTRINSIC CTE MISMATCH BETWEEN C-C SUBSTRATE AND REFRACTORY CARBIDES/OXIDES FURTHER LIMITS THE USE OF MANY OTHER CLASSICAL COATING TECHNOLOGIES. THE SUCCESSFUL PHASE I RESULTS ESTABLISHED THE FEASIBILITY OF OVERCOMING THESE LIMITATIONS THROUGH THE USE OF A NOVEL, FUNCTIONALLY GRADED (FGM) COATING TECHNOLOGY.

WHILE SPACE ROBOTS FOR SATELLITE SERVICING HAVE EMBRACED THE USE OF ROBOTIC TOOL CHANGERS, PLANETARY SCIENCE ROBOTICS SYSTEMS HAVE HISTORICALLY AVOIDED THE USE OF TOOL CHANGERS, BECAUSE TRADITIONAL TOOL CHANGERS USE COMPLEX MECHANICAL LATCHING MECHANISMS WITH MANY EXPOSED MOVING PARTS, WHICH ARE OFTEN MECHANICALLY UNRELIABLE IN DUSTY ENVIRONMENTS. TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS, AND ENABLE PLANETARY SCIENCE MISSIONS TO SWITCH FROM USING MASSIVE, COMPLEX, AND BULKY MULTI-TOOL TURRET DESIGNS, ALTIUS PROPOSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ELECTROPERMANENT MAGNETIC TOOL CHANGER, WHICH HAS NO EXTERNALLY EXPOSED MOVING PARTS. THIS PROPOSED EPM TOOL CHANGER CONCEPT USES A SOLID STATE SWITCHABLE MAGNETIC LATCHING SYSTEM TO HOLD THE TOOL TO THE TOOL CHANGER, AND NON-CONTACT POWER AND DATA TRANSMISSION. AND WHILE IT IS NOT IN THE SCOPE OF THE PROPOSED PHASE I/II EFFORT, THIS TOOL CHANGER DESIGN CAN ALSO ENABLE THE USE OF A CONTACTLESS MECHANICAL TOOL-DRIVE COUPLING SYSTEM, ENABLING MECHANICAL TOOL DRIVE WITHOUT EXPOSED MOVING PARTS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE INTERFACE.

SUCH ANALYTIC TOOLS MUST ALSO BE STREAMLINED AND READILY MASTERED BY RESEARCHERS MAKING SCIENTIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS. IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL CREATE SOFTWARE TO ASSESS BIODIVERSITY CHANGE INDICATORS BY BUILDING ON THE RECENTLY DEVELOPED SOFTWARE WALLACE AS A NEW GEO BON IN A BOX TOOL. WALLACE IS AN R-BASED APPLICATION WITH A GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE THAT SUPPORTS SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELING (SDM) IN A REPRODUCIBLE, FLEXIBLE AND EXTENSIBLE PLATFORM TO FACILITATE A WIDE RANGE OF ECOLOGICAL ANALYSES. THESE MODELS CHARACTERIZE ENVIRONMENTAL SUITABILITY FOR SPECIES AND CAN BE USED TO ESTIMATE SPECIES  GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS  A GEO BON ESSENTIAL BIODIVERSITY VARIABLE (EBV).

THE SECOND PACKAGE WILL ALLOW CALCULATION OF KEY INDICATORS INCLUDING SINGLE-SPECIES BIODIVERSITY CHANGE INDICATORS SUCH AS RANGE SIZE, EXTENT OF OCCURRENCE, PERCENT SUITABLE LAND COVER, OR PROJECTED TRENDS UNDER FUTURE SCENARIOS AT MULTIPLE SPATIAL EXTENTS. CALCULATIONS WILL ALSO INCLUDE MULTI-SPECIES INDICATORS, SUCH AS THE EBV TAXONOMIC DIVERSITY, AND OTHERS NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED THROUGH OTHER BON IN A BOX TOOLS, WITH A FOCUS ON ONES MOST USEFUL AT REGIONAL SCALES. MODULE OUTPUTS FROM WALLACE WILL BE DESIGNED TO FEED DIRECTLY INTO OTHER BON IN A BOX TOOLS, SUCH AS OUR INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATOR INSTITUTO HUMBOLDT S BIOMODELOS. BIOMODELOS IS A WEB APPLICATION ENABLING EXPERT VALIDATION OF SPECIES RANGE ESTIMATES IN SUPPORT OF THE COLOMBIA BON. WE WILL ALSO DEVELOP TRAINING MATERIALS FOR WALLACE TARGETING CONSERVATION PRACTITIONERS THAT REFLECT BEST PRACTICES FOR USING SDM FOR BIODIVERSITY CHANGE INDICATOR CALCULATIONS, RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION DECISION-MAKING. OUR PROJECT RESULTS WILL ADDRESS CHALLENGES TO OVERCOMING THE GAP BETWEEN BEST MODELING PRACTICES AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION DECISION-MAKING AND WILL FACILITATE RESPONSIBLE REPORTING ON BIODIVERSITY BY NATIONAL BONS. VIA FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND ENHANCEMENT OF OPEN-SOURCE, USER-FRIENDLY SOFTWARE TO CONTRIBUTE TO BON IN A BOX, OUR PROPOSAL WILL ADVANCE BROAD APPLICATION, EXPLORATION, VISUALIZATION, AND UNDERSTANDING OF EBVS AND GENERATION OF EBV DATA. FURTHERMORE, DEVELOPING A CONNECTION BETWEEN WALLACE AND BIOMODELOS, ANOTHER BON IN A BOX TOOL, WILL BE VALUABLE FOR FUTURE INTERFACING WITH EFFORTS AT IUCN, BIEN (THE BOTANICAL INFORMATION AND ECOLOGY NETWORK), AND OTHER SIMILAR PROJECTS THAT USE SDM PREDICTIONS AS INPUTS.

"AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY, THE [NEW YORK,NEW YORK]",NNX14AJ56G,NSSC - NASA Shared Services Center,NEW YORK,NY,'10',7/11/2014,5/29/2018,"Non-Profit Institutions - Corporate Entity Tax Exempt, Nonprofit Organization",Grant,"-1,275","513,305","513,398",[None Indicated],N/A,N/A,"METEORITIC CHONDRULES REPRESENT OVER 20% OF THE MASS OF THE MOST PRIMITIVE SOLAR SYSTEM ROCKS. THEIR FORMATION REQUIRES RAPID HEATING TO TEMPERATURES OF AROUND 1800 K, FOLLOWED BY COOLING AT RATES OF AROUND 1000 K/HOUR, FAR SLOWER THAN THE FREE-SPACE COOLING TIME OF SUCH MILLIMETER-SIZED OBJECTS. IDENTIFYING THE MECHANISM FOR THIS UBIQUITOUS HEATING AND COOLING HAS REMAINED A PROBLEM FOR OVER A CENTURY. SIMILAR HIGH-TEMPERATURE MINERALS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN INTERPLANETARY DUST OF COMETARY ORIGIN, AND OBSERVED TRANSITIONS FROM AMORPHOUS TO CRYSTALLINE SILICATE SUGGEST HIGH-TEMPERATURE PROCESSING OF DUST IN OTHER PROTOPLANETARY DISKS. THE SHORT CIRCUIT INSTABILITY THAT WE HAVE RECENTLY DISCOVERED INTERMITTENTLY HEATS PROTOPLANETARY DISKS, PRODUCING THIN SHEETS HOT ENOUGH TO SATISFY THESE CONSTRAINTS. WE PROPOSE TO DETERMINE THE ROLE OF THIS INSTABILITY IN MINERAL FORMATION IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS. MELTING A LARGE FRACTION OF THE SOLIDS IN A PROTOPLANETARY DISK REQUIRES A SUBSTANTIAL SOURCE OF ENERGY. THE SHORT-CIRCUIT INSTABILITY CAN TAP THE HUGE RESERVOIR CONTAINED IN THE DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION OF THE DISK. PROTOPLANETARY DISKS MUST HAVE A VISCOSITY FAR EXCEEDING MOLECULAR VISCOSITY TO ACCRETE GAS AT THE RATES OBSERVED IN YOUNG STELLAR OBJECTS. THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE OF THIS VISCOSITY IS MAGNETIZED TURBULENCE DRIVEN BY THE MAGNETOROTATIONAL INSTABILITY (MRI) WHEREVER THE DISK IS ADEQUATELY IONIZED. MAGNETIZED TURBULENCE QUITE GENERALLY FORMS SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY INTERMITTENT CURRENT SHEETS THAT DISSIPATE THE MAGNETIC ENERGY AS HEAT. THESE CAN RAISE THE GAS TEMPERATURE LOCALLY WELL BEYOND ITS VOLUME AVERAGE.  IF TEMPERATURES REACH 1000 K, GAS RESISTIVITY STARTS TO FALL SHARPLY AS ALKALI METALS ARE THERMALLY IONIZED. OVER THE RANGE FROM 1000 K TO 2000 K, THE RESISTIVITY DECREASES BY MORE THAN 5 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. IN THAT TEMPERATURE RANGE, THE RESISTIVE EVOLUTION OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS DOMINATED BY THE SPATIAL VARIATION IN THE RESISTIVITY. SIMILARLY TO ELECTRICAL SHORT CIRCUITS AND LIGHTNING, THE ELECTRICAL CURRENTS IN THE DISK CONCENTRATE IN HOT, HIGH CONDUCTIVITY REGIONS, LEADING TO STRONG RESISTIVE HEATING IN NARROW SHEETS. WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THIS INSTABILITY CAN OCCUR IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS, EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF RADIATIVE COOLING. IN SOME CASES THE GAS IN OUR MODELS REACHES TEMPERATURES HIGH ENOUGH TO FORM CHONDRULES AND OTHER SIMILAR MINERALS.  WE PROPOSE TO FIND THE GAS AND GRAIN TEMPERATURES REACHED IN CURRENT SHEETS DRAWN DIRECTLY FROM MRI TURBULENCE. WE WILL USE LARGESCALE MODELS OF CURRENT SHEET FORMATION BY THE MRI TO SET THE STAGE FOR SMALL-SCALE MODELS OF INDIVIDUAL CURRENT SHEETS. THE MRI MODELS WILL USE THE PENCIL CODE TO CHARACTERIZE CURRENT SHEETS IN STRATIFIED, SHEARING-BOX SIMULATIONS WITHOUT TEMPERATURE DEPENDENT RESISTIVITY, AND IN HIGHER-RESOLUTION, UNSTRATIFIED SIMULATIONS WITH IT. TO IMPROVE OUR MODELING OF THE GAS RESISTIVITY AND THE MRI WE WILL USE A CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM CODE TO CALCULATE THE IONIZATION FRACTION IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS: THE ALKALI METALS CAN BE LOCKED AWAY IN SOLID MINERALS, PREVENTING THEIR THERMAL IONIZATION. TOGETHER THESE MODELS WILL PROVIDE THE INITIAL AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR SIMULATIONS OF INDIVIDUAL CURRENT SHEETS USING A PURPOSE-BUILT IMPLICIT CODE INCLUDING RADIATIVE TRANSFER AS WELL AS TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT RESISTIVITY. HISTORIES OF THE GAS TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE, AND THE AMBIENT RADIATION, SAMPLED USING LAGRANGIAN TRACER PARTICLES, WILL ALLOW US TO USE THE EQUILIBRIUM CONDENSATION CODE TO COMPARE THE EXPERIENCE OF SOLIDS IN OUR SIMULATIONS WITH EXPERIMENTAL CONSTRAINTS ON CHONDRULES AND OTHER HIGH-TEMPERATURE MINERALS. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS THAT THE SHORT CIRCUIT INSTABILITY CAN PRODUCE GRAIN THERMAL HISTORIES CONSISTENT WITH EXPERIMENTAL AND OBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE ENSEMBLE OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE MINERALS IN OUR OWN AND EXTERNAL DISKS."

THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AN OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, CALLED OPENSPACE, FOR VISUALIZING NASA ASTROPHYSICS, HELIOPHYSICS, PLANETARY SCIENCE, AND EARTH SCIENCE MISSION ENGINEERING ACTIVITIES AND SCIENCE RESULTS FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC, STUDENTS, TEACHERS, AND CITIZEN SCIENTISTS EVERYWHERE. THE  PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AND WIDELY DISSEMINATE OPENSPACE, CREATE INNOVATIVE AND NETWORKED PROGRAMS WITH ISI PARTNERS, PRODUCE EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES FOR MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS AND STUDENTS, AND ESTABLISH ROBUST PARTNERSHIPS WITH NASA SMD MISSIONS, ISIS, AND VISUALIZATION RESEARCH CENTERS.  THE PROJECT IS BASED ON THE SUCCESS OF PILOT EFFORTS TO VISUALIZE THE NEW HORIZONS MISSION AND HELIOPHYSICS AND SPACE WEATHER SIMULATION DATA GENERATED BY NASA GODDARDS COMMUNITY COORDINATED MODELING CENTER. IT BUILDS ON AMNHS EXPERTISE IN SCIENCE VISUALIZATION AND ITS RECORD OF SUCCESS IN PARTNERING WITH NASA TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE PROGRAMMING, EXHIBITIONS, AND SPACE SHOWS THAT ENGAGE, INSPIRE, AND EDUCATE STUDENTS, TEACHERS, AND LEARNERS OF ALL AGES.  DRAWING TOGETHER A HIGHLY QUALIFIED AND EXCEPTIONALLY TALENTED TEAM OF SCIENTISTS, EDUCATORS, SOFTWARE ENGINEERS, AND VISUALIZATION SPECIALISTS, THE PROJECTS AIM IS TO  BUILD A PIPELINE FOR TRANSMITTING VISUALIZED SCIENCE CONTENT FROM ACROSS NASA SMD DIVISIONS TO  ISIS, SECONDARY SCHOOL CLASSROOMS, AND THE PUBLIC.  TO DO SO, THE PROJECT PROPOSES THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES  DEVELOP OPENSPACE INTO A ROBUST AND FLEXIBLE INTERACTIVE VISUALIZATION SOFTWARE THAT SUPPORTS THE PRESENTATION OF DYNAMIC DATA SETS AND THAT IS EASILY UPDATED FOR THE PRESENTATION OF CURRENT SCIENCE.  FORM A NETWORK OF ISIS TO INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF OPENSPACE AND DEVELOP ASSOCIATED PROGRAMMING TO ENGAGE AND EDUCATE DIVERSE AUDIENCES.  DISSEMINATE OPENSPACE VIA THE WEB TO INDIVIDUAL USERS, INCLUDING TEACHERS AS A KEY AUDIENCE, WITH RESOURCES FOR LEVERAGING IT AS AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL.  PROJECT OUTCOMES INCLUDE  THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PIPELINE CONNECTING NASA SMD CONTENT AND SMES WITH ISIS, SECONDARY SCHOOL CLASSROOMS, AND THE PUBLIC.  THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW AND POWERFUL EDUCATIONAL TOOL FOR THE VISUALIZATION OF A WIDE RANGE OF NASA SMD MISSION ACTIVITIES AND DATA PRODUCTS.

THE 3D CT WILL ALSO ALLOW DENSITY ESTIMATES OF CHONDRULE POPULATIONS. THIS IS COMPLEMENTED BY POSITION-SENSITIVE X-RAY DIFFRACTION FOR MODAL MINERAL ABUNDANCES(AT CUNY). WE WILL FOCUS ON SELECTED ORDINARY CHONDRITES (THE MOST ABUNDANT PRIMITIVE METEORITES) AND CR CHONDRITES, TO MEASURE THE ABUNDANCE AND SIZES OF THEIR MILLIMETER-SIZED CHONDRULES, AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF ELEMENTS AMONG CHONDRULES AND MATRIX. WE WILL ALSO APPLY THE SAME TOOLS TO THE VERY DIFFERENT CM CHONDRITES. THE 3D CT WILL INVOLVE STUDENT INVESTIGATORS AT FORDHAM. THIS WORK WILL INCREASE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF ASTEROID PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND CLARIFY HOW WE COULD USE CHONDRITIC BODIES AS IN SITU RESOURCES FOR SPACE EXPLORATION.  CHONDRITIC ASTEROIDS GREW FROM SMALL SOLIDS IN A GAS-RICH DISK AROUND THE EARLY SUN. WE WILL APPLY THEORY AND MODELING TO INVESTIGATE HOW GAS AND SOLID CHEMISTRY VARIED IN TIME AND SPACE AROUND THE SUN, AND HOW CHEMISTRY AFFECTED AND WAS AFFECTED BY PHYSICAL PHENOMENA SUCH AS MAGNETIC FIELDS AND DUST OPACITY. TO DO THIS, WE WILL INTEGRATE OUR CHEMICAL MODELS WITH ASTROPHYSICAL DYNAMICAL CODES TO SIMULTANEOUSLY ADDRESS DISK CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS. THIS WORK WILL BE INFORMED BY OUR PETROLOGICAL STUDIES, WHICH PROVIDE TESTS OF HYPOTHESES DEVELOPED USING MODELS. IN THE LABORATORY, WE WILL CONTINUE TESTS OF SELECTED PREDICTIONS MADE BY OUR CHEMICAL MODELS THAT DESCRIBE PARTIAL OR COMPLETE EQUILIBRIUM AMONG SILICATE SOLIDS AND LIQUIDS CONDENSING FROM HYDROGEN-RICH DISK VAPORS. REAL OUTCOMES OF THIS PROCESS ARE RECORDED IN THE CHONDRULES AND OTHER INCLUSIONS IN METEORITES. THESE TESTS PROVIDE \GROUND TRUTH\"" FOR MODELS, AND PROVIDE NEW CALIBRATION POINTS FOR FUTURE, IMPROVED CHEMICAL MODELS. TRACE ELEMENTS SUCH AS THE RARE EARTH ELEMENTS CAN PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF CONDITIONS IN THE EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM, BECAUSE THEIR PARTITIONING IS CONTROLLED BY TEMPERATURE AND OXYGEN ABUNDANCE. WE WILL INVESTIGATE TRACE ELEMENT PARTITIONING AMONG MINERALS, SILICATE LIQUIDS, AND VAPOR BOTH IN THE LAB AND BY APPLICATION OF THEORY. WE WILL MEASURE THESE DISTRIBUTIONS AMONG CHONDRITE COMPONENTS. WE WILL USE THOSE RESULTS TO INTERPRET THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF TRACE ELEMENTS AMONG COMPONENTS IN A RANGE OF CHONDRITE TYPES, TO TEST ASTROPHYSICALCOSMOCHEMICAL HYPOTHESES FOR THE ORIGINS OF COMPONENTS AND THEIR ACCRETION. UPON COMPLETION OF DISCOVERY AND INTERPRETATION, WE WILL DISSEMINATE OUR RESULTS TO THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY THROUGH PEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS, AND TO THE PUBLIC THROUGH PRESENTATIONS AND MUSEUM-BASED INFORMAL EDUCATION. ALL OF THIS WORK WILL ADDRESS THE EMERGING WORLDS GOAL OF UNDERSTANDING \""HOW THE SUN''S FAMILY OF PLANETS, SATELLITES, AND MINOR BODIES (INCLUDING SMALL BODIES AND RINGS) FORM AND EVOLVE\"", AND MATCHES NASA''S PARTICULAR INTEREST IN \""RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT CLOSELY SUPPORT ITS MISSION FOR EXPLORING THE SOLAR SYSTEM, CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUTURE MISSIONS, OR INVOLVE MAJOR INTERDISCIPLINARY EFFORTS TO SOLVE KEY QUESTIONS\"" (ROSES 2015 C.1-10)."""

ANALYSIS OF WHOLE COMET GRAIN TRACKS IN  AEROGEL WILL BE USED TO INFER THE ORIGINAL PROPERTIES OF GRAINS BEFORE THEIR 6.1 KM SEC IMPACT INTO THE AEROGEL CAPTURE MEDIUM USED BY THE STARDUST MISSION. WE HAVE DEVELOPED EXPERTISE IN USING A LASER SCANNING CONFOCAL MICROSCOPE LCSM TO OBTAIN HIGH RESOLUTION 74 NM BY 74 NM X AND Y BY 370 NM ON OPTIC AXIS Z RESOLUTION 3D IMAGES, IN MULTIPLE WAVELENGTHS, OF PARTICLE TRACKS IN KEYSTONES CUT FROM THE AEROGEL CAPTURE TILES. WE HAVE GREATLY IMPROVED OUR ABILITY TO BETTER RESOLVE INDIVIDUAL FEATURES IN PARTICLE TRACKS BY IMPROVING DECONVOLUTION TECHNIQUE TO REMOVE DISTORTIONS WHICH ARE INHERENT IN THIS KIND OF OPTICAL MICROSCOPY. WE WILL COMBINE LCSM MAPS WITH  STEREO X RAY FLUORESCENCE CHEMICAL MAPPING S XRF AT 2 MICRONS PIXEL PERFORMED AT THE ADVANCED PHOTON SOURCE SYNCHROTRON, A DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY USER FACILITY. WE HAVE DEVELOPED STEREO S XRF IMAGING METHODS TO IDENTIFY NON COMETARY DUST CONTAMINANTS ON KEYSTONE SURFACES, AND TO MATCH UP CHEMICAL SIGNATURES S XRF SPECTRA WITH SPECIFIC PARTICLES IN THE 3D LSCM DATA. THE THIRD TECHNIQUE, WHICH WE WILL DEVELOP DURING THE PROPOSED GRANT CYCLE, IS LASER RAMAN MICROSCOPY COUPLED WITH THE IMAGING ABILITY OF THE LSCM. WE WERE SELECTED IN THE ROSES 2013 CYCLE AND HAVE INSTALLED A RAMAN SPECTROMETER ON OUR LSCM BENCH. WE GOT FIRST LIGHT SPECTRA ON THIS INSTRUMENT IN APRIL 2015. WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO SWITCH BETWEEN REFLECTANCE IMAGING MODE AND THE RAMAN SPECTROMETER WITHOUT CHANGING FOCUS, AND TO BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN BROAD CLASSES OF GRAINS METAL, SULFIDE, SILICATE, AND CA, AL, REE RICH CAI LIKE GRAINS. THIS WILL OFFER ADVANTAGES OVER S XRF, FOR WHICH BEAMTIME IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE INTEND TO DRAW ON THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR COLLABORATORS IN RAMAN AND OTHER SPECTROSCOPIES. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED BY PRELIMINARY RAMAN WORK ON BASALT SHOT AEROGEL THAT FLUORESCENCE IS NOT A KILLER IN USING RAMAN ON THESE SAMPLES. COLLEAGUES IN ENGLAND HAVE PROVED PROOF OF CONCEPT USING RAMAN ON AEROGEL KEYSTONES, ALTHOUGH WITH MUCH LOWER SPATIAL RESOLUTION THAN OURS. WE ARE HIGHLY COGNIZANT THAT WE MUST THOROUGHLY TEST THIS INSTRUMENT ON LAB ANALOGS AND MINIMIZE POWER SO THAT OUR ANALYSIS  DOES NOT ALTER EITHER MINERALS OR ORGANIC MATERIAL IN THE COMET TRACKS. A PRIMARY GOAL IS TO DISCOVER POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT COMET GRAINS SO THAT THEIR EXTRACTION AND MOUNTING CAN BE REQUESTED BY COLLABORATOR DAVIS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO FOR ANALYSIS WITH NANOMETER SCALE ANALYTICAL FACILITIES. OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE EXTREMELY DETAILED 3D INFORMATION ON GRAIN LOCATIONS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS GOAL. A FURTHER GOAL IS TO DEVELOP OUR ABILITY TO MODEL THE PHYSICS OF HYPERVELOCITY IMPACTS INTO AEROGEL SO THAT THE ORIGINAL PROPERTIES MASS, POROSITY OF IMPACTING COMETARY PARTICLES MIGHT BE INFERRED. WE HAVE OBTAINED THE HYDRODYNAMIC CODES CTH AND ISALE, AND WE WILL WORK WITH COLLABORATOR GROUP TO DEVELOP AN EQUATION OF STATE FOR SILICA AEROGEL. BOTH CTH AND ISALE ARE CODES USED WITHIN  THE IMPACT MODELING COMMUNITY FOR PROBLEMS SIMILAR TO THE STARDUST HYPERVELOCITY IMPACT SCENARIO. UPON COMPLETION OF WORK, WE WILL DISSEMINATE OUR RESULTS TO THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY THROUGH PEER REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS, AND TO THE PUBLIC THROUGH PRESENTATIONS AND MUSEUM BASED INFORMAL  EDUCATION. WE WILL ARCHIVE ALL OUR RESULTS AT AMNH AND PROVIDE THEM TO JSC CURATION AS APPROPRIATE.  THIS WORK WILL ADDRESS THE LARS GOAL, TO MAXIMIZE THE SCIENTIFIC RETURN FROM THE SAMPLES PROVIDED BY MISSIONS SUCH AS STARDUST, THROUGH DEVELOPMENT OF   ADVANCED ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES REQUIRED FOR THE COMPLETE ANALYSES OF THE SAMPLES. IT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUTURE MISSIONS THAT MIGHT USE AEROGEL CAPTURE."

THE WORKSHOP WILL FOCUS ON CRITICAL ISSUES IN THE DEVELOPMENT, INTEGRATION, AND UTILIZATION OF AIR POLLUTION MONITORING DATA COLLECTED VIA MULTIPLE TECHNOLOGY APPROACHES. THE FRAMING OF THE WORKSHOP IS FOCUSED ON THE UTILIZATION OF MONITORING DATA FOR HEALTH RESEARCH AND PATIENT CARE AND WILL BE OF INTEREST TO HEALTH RESEARCHERS, HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS, INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS, AND MEMBERS OF THE TECHNICAL MONITORING COMMUNITY. KEY ISSUES DISCUSSED DURING THE WORKSHOP WILL BE INCLUDED IN A WRITTEN WORKSHOP REPORT THAT WILL ALSO INCLUDE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE GENERATED ORGANICALLY THROUGH DISCUSSION AMONG WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS. MANY INDIVIDUALS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE PARTICIPATING IN THE WORKSHOP. IN DEFINING THE SCOPE OF THIS WORKSHOP, IT IS IMPORTANT TO DEFINE TOPICS THAT WILL NOT BE DIRECTLY COVERED IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A NARROWLY FOCUSED AGENDA. TOPICS THAT WILL NOT BE DIRECTLY ADDRESSED INCLUDE: OCCUPATIONAL MONITORING; INDOOR AIR QUALITY MONITORING; SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGIES OR PRODUCTS WITHIN BROAD TECHNOLOGICAL CATEGORIES; OR REGULATORY ISSUES INVOLVING MANDATED AIR QUALITY MONITORING. THESE ARE VALUABLE TOPICS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT BUT WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A CLEAR FOCUS FOR THE WORKSHOP. TECHNOLOGY USED FOR AIR POLLUTION MONITORING IS DEVELOPING AT A BREAKNECK PACE. DECISIONS ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF AIR POLLUTION MONITORING ARE CURRENTLY BEING MADE THAT WILL DEFINE THE AVAILABILITY AND CAPABILITY OF AIR POLLUTION DATA THAT HEALTH RESEARCHERS AND PATIENTS WILL RELY ON FOR THE NEXT 10-20 YEARS.

ADDITIONALLY, THE DECISIONS MADE BY ENGINEERS AND DATA SCIENTISTS MAY NOT FULLY CONSIDER THE NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR COLLECTING DATA IN WAYS THAT ARE MOST USEFUL FOR HEALTH RESEARCH AND PATIENT CARE. THIS WORKSHOP IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ATS TO PARTNER WITH THOUGHT LEADING FEDERAL PARTNERS LIKE NASA AND EPA TO CONSIDER RECENT ADVANCES IN AIR POLLUTION MONITORING. NASA HAS PLAYED A PIVOTAL ROLE IN ADVANCING THE SCIENCE OF SATELLITE MONITORING OF AIR POLLUTION AND HAS RECENTLY MADE STRIDES TO USE THIS EXPERTISE IN HEALTH APPLICATIONS. EPA PLAYS A KEY FEDERAL RULE IN VALIDATING AND USING AIR POLLUTION MONITORING DATA TO ESTABLISH REGULATORY POLICY AND HAS ASSISTED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PORTABLE MONITORS. NIEHS FUNDS SIGNIFICANT BASIC RESEARCH IN THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTION EXPOSURES AND AS SUCH IS A KEY USER OF AIR POLLUTION MONITORING DATA FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES (STATIONARY MONITORS, PERSONAL SENSORS AND SATELLITE MONITORS). THE GENERATED WORKSHOP REPORT WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL INFORMATION FOR ATS MEMBERS INTERESTED IN AIR POLLUTION MONITORING FOR HEALTH RESEARCH AND PATIENT CARE. ATS WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO TAKE A LEADING ROLE IN SHAPING THE DIRECTION OF NEAR-FUTURE AIR POLLUTION MONITORING. IT IS EXPECTED THAT RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE GENERATED FROM WORKSHOP DISCUSSIONS AND PRESENTATIONS THAT WILL INFORM NEAR-FUTURE NASA SATELLITE MISSIONS, INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO DEVELOP MONITORING NETWORKS, AND THE STANDARDIZATION OF DATA COLLECTED FROM LOW-COST SENSORS. THIS PROJECT IS A PRIORITY FOR ATS MEMBERS, AND FOR ATS AS AN INSTITUTION, NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE WORKSHOP BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE LOCATION OF THE 2017 ATS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN WASHINGTON DC PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP TRAVEL COSTS LOW AND INCREASE PARTICIPATION FROM AGENCY EXPERTS LOCATED IN AND AROUND THE DC AREA."

KEPLER HAS REVEALED FREQUENT SUPERFLARES ON SOLAR-TYPE STARS, PROVIDING A MECHANISM BY WHICH HOST STARS MAY HAVE PROFOUND EFFECTS ON THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL EVOLUTION OF EXOPLANETARY ATMOSPHERES. WHAT EFFECT DO EXTREME ENERGY FLUXES FROM ERUPTIVE EVENTS DURING EARLY STELLAR EVOLUTION TOGETHER WITH UV LIGHT HAVE ON PREBIOTIC CHEMISTRY, IN PARTICULAR ON THE PRODUCTION OF SMALL MOLECULE PRECURSORS CURRENTLY THOUGHT NECESSARY FOR NUCLEOSIDE SYNTHESIS, AND BY CONSEQUENCE THE ORIGIN OF LIFE ON PRIMITIVE PLANETS? THIS MAY BE IMPORTANT IN TERRESTRIAL PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES, WHERE SPECIES SUCH AS MOLECULAR NITROGEN AND CARBON DIOXIDE WOULD REQUIRE HIGH ENERGY IRRADIATION IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE RECOMBINED INTO REACTIVE SPECIES SUCH AS HCN AND NOX, THE FORMER OF WHICH IS CONSIDERED CRUCIAL FOR NUCLEOSIDE FORMATION   AN OUTSTANDING CHALLENGE IN THE FIELD. OUR PROPOSAL AIMS TO ADDRESS THESE MAJOR QUESTIONS BY PERFORMING COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF IONIZING RADIATION INITIATED BY ENERGETIC ERUPTIVE EVENTS INCLUDING SUPERFLARES FROM YOUNG STARS AND ASSOCIATED PARTICLE EVENTS ON THE PREBIOTIC CHEMISTRY OF THE EARLY EARTH AND ITS TWINS. FIRST, WE WILL CALIBRATE ATMOSPHERIC PHOTO-COLISSIONAL CHEMICAL MODELS USING EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION OF GAS AND AQUEOUS PHASE CHEMISTRY. SECOND, WE WILL CHARACTERIZE THE PROCESSES OF NITROGEN FIXATION AND THE CHAIN OF REACTIONS PRODUCING NOX, N2O, HCN AND OTHER N-CONTAINING SPECIES IN A GAS- AND LATER LIQUID-PHASE THAT MAY EVENTUALLY FORM ORGANIC MOLECULES OF VARYING DEGREES OF COMPLEXITY ESPECIALLY THOSE RELEVANT IN THE PREBIOTIC SYNTHESIS OF NUCLEOSIDES, NOTABLY RNA. METHODOLOGY. WE WILL EMPLOY OUR 1D PHOTO-COLLISIONAL ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY MODEL TO COMPUTE THE CHEMICAL FORMATION RATES OF COMPLEX ORGANIC MOLECULES INCLUDING O- AND N-CONTAINING HYDROCARBONS IN THE GAS PHASE. THESE SIMULATIONS WILL ALLOW TO US INVESTIGATE THE VIABLE PHOTOCHEMICAL MECHANISMS FOR NITROGEN AND OXYGEN FIXATION INTO COMPLEX ORGANIC MOLECULES IN THE ATMOSPHERES OF EARLY EARTH AND MARS. THESE SIMULATIONS WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN EXPERIMENTS THAT EXPLORE THE STEADY-STATE GAS COMPOSITION OF N2/CO2/H2O GAS MIXTURES, ALONE AND IN COMBINATION WITH MINOR AMOUNTS OF CO OR CH4, EXPOSED TO A VARIETY OF ENERGY SOURCES INCLUDING PARTICLES, ELECTRIC DISCHARGES AND UV LIGHT, AS WELL AS THE NATURE OF THE WATER SOLUBLE SPECIES WHEN GENERATED IN THE PRESENCE OF AN AQUEOUS PHASE HELD AT VARIOUS PH VALUES THAT SIMULATE PRIMITIVE PLANETARY STANDING WATER BODIES. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES WILL BE CONDUCTED BY FLOWING 0.1 TO 1 ATM TOTAL PRESSURE GAS MIXTURES CONTAINING VARIOUS PARTIAL PRESSURES OF CO2 AND N2 TOGETHER WITH ADMIXTURES OF LESSER AMOUNTS OF H2O, CO, H2 OR CH4. THESE WILL BE IRRADIATED BY A PROTON GUN, UV LAMP AND ELECTRIC DISCHARGE. STEADY-STATE GAS COMPOSTIONS WILL BE MEASURED DOWNSTREAM FROM THE REACTION CHAMBER USING A RESIDUAL GAS ANALYZER. SOLUBLE SPECIES WILL BE MEASURED USING ION CHROMATOGRAPHY, DIRECT INFUSION TIME-OF-FLIGHT MASS SPECTROMETRY, SPECTROSCOPICALLY USING NMR, AND CHEMICALLY WITH VARIOUS ASSAYS. RELEVANCE TO EXOBIOLOGY PROGRAM. THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CONDITIONS SETTING STAGE FOR THE ORIGIN OF LIFE ON EARTH, THE RESOLUTION OF THE FYS ON THE EARLY EARTH/MARS AND HABITABILITY CONDITIONS ON TERRESTRIAL PLANETS AROUND YOUNG STARS. AS A SOURCE OF PREBIOTIC NITROGEN THIS WORK IS RELEVANT TO THE RESEARCH AREA OF  PREBIOTIC EVOLUTION . ABIOTIC NITROGEN FIXATION IS ONE OF THE  PLANETARY AND MOLECULAR PROCESSES THAT SET THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CONDITIONS WITHIN WHICH LIVING SYSTEMS MAY HAVE ARISEN  BY HELPING TO UNDERSTAND HOW PLANETARY NITROGEN BECAME AVAILABLE FOR USE IN THE ORIGIN AND EARLY EVOLUTION OF LIFE. OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE GLOBAL SCALE OF NITROGEN FIXATION WILL HELP MODEL  EARLY ENVIRONMENTS ON THE EARTH IN WHICH ORGANIC CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS COULD OCCUR,  AND MAY SHED LIGHT ON THE PREBIOTIC SYNTHESIS OF NUCLEOSIDES LIKE RNA."

THE EARTH FORMED IN A WATER-POOR REGION OF THE PROTOPLANETARY DISK, AND EVEN TODAY THE BULK EARTH IS COSMICALLY DRY (POOR IN HYDROGEN, RELATIVE TO THE PROTOPLANETARY DISK). AT SOME 60 MA AFTER EARTH-ACCRETION, THE MOON-FORMING IMPACT PROBABLY REMOVED ANY WATER THAT MAY HAVE OUTGASSED AFTER CORE FORMATION, LEAVING THE HADEAN EARTH WATER-POOR AT ITS SURFACE. YET, EARLY ZIRCONS ARGUE THAT OCEANS EXISTED BY 250 MA AFTER FORMATION. SO, WAS WATER DELIVERED BY IMPACT DURING THE INTERVENING MILLENNIA, WHILE THE DECLINING HEAVY BOMBARDMENT WAS IN FULL SWING? WHAT ROLE DID PRIMITIVE BODIES PLAY IN DELIVERING WATER AND PRE-BIOTIC ORGANICS TO THE YOUNG EARTH? TOGETHER, THE INTERCOMPARISON OF COMETS (AND THEIR DYNAMICAL FAMILIES) WILL ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND WILL ALSO CLARIFY KEY QUESTIONS OF COMETARY ORIGINS. THE GODDARD COMET TEAM PIONEERED THE DIRECT STUDY OF PRIMARY VOLATILES IN COMETS AT INFRARED WAVELENGTHS, ESTABLISHING THE THEORETICAL BASIS FOR THIS APPROACH (MUMMA NASA CP-2223 1982, WEAVER AND MUMMA APJ 1984) AND DEMONSTRATING ITS FIRST SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION BY DETECTING H20 IN COMET IP/HALLEY IN 1985 (MUMMA ET AL. SCIENCE 1986). SINCE THEN, THE EVER-EXPANDING AND -EVOLVING GODDARD TEAM HAS PUBLISHED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED REFEREED PAPERS BASED ON AIRBORNE AND GROUND-BASED ASTRONOMICAL SPECTROSCOPY OF COMETS, EXTENDING THE APPROACH TO MANY MOLECULAR SPECIES INCLUDING ISOTOPOLOGUES. SINCE ITS INCEPTION, THIS IR APPROACH HAS BECOME A STANDARD FOR REMOTE SENSING OF PRIMARY VOLATILES IN COMETS, AND MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT GROUPS WORLDWIDE NOW APPLY IT. AUGMENTED BY RADIO INVESTIGATIONS, THE COMBINED APPROACHES NOW ADDRESS UP TO SEVERAL DOZEN MOLECULAR SPECIES IN A GIVEN COMET, PERMITTING ATTEMPTS TO DEFINE A TAXONOMY FOR COMETS BASED ON THEIR VOLATILE COMPOSITION, USING THE SO-QUANTIFIED ABUNDANCES OF PRIMARY COMA VOLATILES THAT WERE STORED INITIALLY IN THE ICY NUCLEUS. TODAY, THIS RESEARCH IS ACHIEVED THROUGH THE CURRENT GENERATION OF NEAR-INFRARED (A.#tilde# 1-5  M) LONG-SLIT ECHELLE GRATING SPECTROMETERS THAT INCORPORATE LARGE-FORMAT 2-D DETECTOR ARRAYS (2KX2K) WITH SUB-ARC-SECOND PIXEL SIZES. THEY COMBINE HIGH ANGULAR RESOLUTION (TYPICALLY :S 1 ARC-SECOND) WITH THE HIGH SPECTRAL RESOLVING POWER (A./8A. 2: 2.5X104 AND HIGHER) REQUIRED FOR ISOLATION OF INDIVIDUAL COMETARY EMISSION LINES. IN PARALLEL WITH THEIR FIRST-LINE USE OF DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED INSTRUMENTS, THE TEAM ALSO ACHIEVED MAJOR ADVANCES IN THEORY AND DATA PROCESSING. THESE WERE ENABLED BY THE ADVENT OF COMPREHENSIVE SPECTROSCOPIC DATABASES CONTAINING BILLIONS OF LINES, ROBUST RADIATIVE TRANSFER MODELS, AND UNPRECEDENTED COMPUTATIONAL POWER. THEY TRANSFORMED THE WAY WE INVESTIGATE COMETARY ATMOSPHERES. THE GOAL IS TO EXTRACT THE MAXIMUM SCIENCE FROM DATA RETURNED BY THESE INSTRUMENTS.

TRADITIONALLY, CRYOCOOLERS FOR SUCH APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN STIRLING OR PULSE TUBE REFRIGERATORS. THESE CRYOCOOLERS, ALTHOUGH EFFECTIVE, ARE HEAVY, BULKY, INEFFICIENT, AND MAY CAUSE VIBRATIONS. A HIGH-PERFORMANCE SOLID-STATE CRYOCOOLER BASED ON THERMOMAGNETIC COOLING VIA THE ETTINGSHAUSEN EFFECT CAN BE LIGHTER, SMALLER, VIBRATION FREE, AND USE LESS POWER THAN THE ALTERNATIVES. HISTORICALLY, THE PRACTICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE ETTINGSHAUSEN COOLERS WAS DISCOURAGED AS THEY REQUIRED A MAGNETIC FIELD DIFFICULT TO REACH BY TRADITIONAL FERRITE MAGNETS. HOWEVER, RECENT RARE-EARTH PERMANENT MAGNETS CAN PRODUCE THE REQUIRED FIELD RELIABLY. WE PROPOSE AN ETTINGSHAUSEN COOLER CONSISTING OF ADVANCED PERMANENT MAGNETS COMBINED WITH A NOVEL SEMICONDUCTOR HETEROSTRUCTURE PREDICTED TO SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SOLID-STATE CRYOGENIC COOLING IN A COMPACT SIZE. THE PHASE I WORK WILL DEMONSTRATE THE PRELIMINARY MATERIALS PROPERTIES AND THE DESIGN REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE COOLING POWER LARGER THAN 0.2?0.3 W IN 30-35 K TEMPERATURES RANGES FOR THE REJECTION TEMPERATURE OF 150 K, WHILE CONSUMING LESS THAN 5 W POWER.

THROUGH THE STRONG FOUNDATION OF BROAD SYSTEMATIC TASK ANALYSIS BASED ON OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS DERIVED FROM THE PLANETARY DESIGN REFERENCE MISSION (DRM)/ MARS DESIGN REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE CONDUCTED BY AN EXPERIENCED COLLABORATIVE TEAM, THE SHFE-TRAIN-04: WE DO NOT KNOW THE TYPES OF SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE THAT CAN BE RETAINED AND GENERALIZED ACROSS TASKS FOR A GIVEN MISSION TO MAXIMIZE CREW PERFORMANCE WILL BE THE MAIN GAP FOCUS FOR THIS RESEARCH. BY CATEGORIZING THE SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE OVER A WIDE SPECTRUM OF DOMAINS, COMMONALITIES AND OVERLAPS OF SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE CAN BE DOCUMENTED TO ENABLE IDENTIFYING GENERALIZABLE SKILLS. ALSO WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS FUNDING, A PRELIMINARY SET OF TASKS FROM DIFFERING DOMAINS THAT SHARE COMMON SKILLS/KNOWLEDGE CAN BE FORMALLY ASSESSED TO EXPLORE THE GENERALIZABILITY AND TRANSFERABILITY OF DIFFERENT DOMAINS WITH SIMILAR SKILLS/KNOWLEDGE BASE. THIS WILL PROVIDE THE SHFE TRAINING RISK CUSTODIANS THE POSSIBILITY OF CREATING A ROBUST TOOL WITH AN EXTENSIVE DATABASE ON WHICH TO LEVERAGE FUTURE PLANNED TRAINING WORK TO VALIDATE OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF OPERATORY PROFICIENCY AND TRAINING EFFECTIVENESS (I.E. SHFE-TRAIN-01) AND DEVELOP GUIDELINES FOR EFFECTIVE ONBOARD TRAINING (I.E. SHFE-TRAIN-02)."

STELLAR ROTATION COUPLED WITH CONVECTIVE MOTIONS GIVE RISE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS. HIGH PRECISION SPECTROSCOPY AND PHOTOMETRY MEASUREMENTS HAVE DETECTED CYCLES IN THE MAGNETIC ACTIVITY OF STARS SIMILAR TO THE 11 YEAR SOLAR CYCLE. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DISCOVER CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT GOVERN STELLAR CYCLE DYNAMICS UTILIZING SPECTROSCOPY AND PHOTOMETRY MEASUREMENTS FROM SUN-LIKE STARS. IN PARTICULAR, OUR INVESTIGATION WILL RELATE BASIC OBSERVABLES, SUCH AS MASS, METALLICITY, RADIUS, ROTATION RATE, DEPTH OF CONVECTION ZONE, AND DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION RATES WITH TOTAL SOLAR IRRADIANCE AND STARSPOT PROPERTIES INCLUDING: TOTAL SPOTTEDNESS AND SWITCHING OF DOMINANT ACTIVITY BETWEEN LONGITUDES (FLIP-FLOP CYCLES). WE WILL FOCUS ON DETERMINING WHICH FACTORS CONTROL THE PERIODICITY OF STARSPOTS, HOW STELLAR CYCLES EVOLVE WITH THE AGE OF STARS, AND WHICH FACTORS DETERMINE DEEP GLOBAL MINIMA IN STELLAR CYCLE DYNAMICS. METHODOLOGY: WE WILL UTILIZE A SET OF INFORMATION-THEORETICAL TOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN RECENTLY DEVELOPED TO EXAMINE CAUSE AND EFFECT RELATIONSHIPS IN OBSERVATIONAL DATASETS. TRANSFER ENTROPY AND MUTUAL REDUNDANCY ARE ENTROPY-BASED MEASURES OF DEPENDENCY (E.G. MUTUAL INFORMATION) THAT ARE BASED ON CONDITIONAL PROBABILITIES AND CAN BE USED TO MEASURE THE DIRECTED INFORMATION TRANSFER BETWEEN TWO VARIABLES. THE CONDITIONAL REDUNDANCY WILL BE USED TO SYSTEMATICALLY ISOLATE CONTROLLING VARIABLES FROM A SET OF INPUT MEASUREMENTS. ONCE CAUSAL VARIABLES ARE IDENTIFIED, WE WILL CONSTRUCT COUPLING FUNCTIONS TO DESCRIBE THE DEPENDENCE OF STELLAR CYCLE DYNAMICS ON THE CAUSAL VARIABLES USING THE PRINCIPLE OF MAXIMIZATION OF INFORMATION. PROPOSED CONTRIBUTION TO THE FOCUS TEAM EFFORT AND RELEVANCE TO NASA: THIS INVESTIGATION WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE FOCUS TEAM EFFORT 3.1.2 \THE SOLAR-STELLAR CONNECTION.\"" THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUES WILL BE USED TO IDENTIFY PROCESSES (VARIABLES) THAT CONTROL TOTAL SOLAR IRRADIANCE AND STARSPOT CYCLES, INCLUDING PERIODICITY AND DEEP GLOBAL MINIMA, AND TO CONSTRUCT NONLINEAR MAPS THAT CAPTURE THE ACTIVITY CYCLE DYNAMICS AND HAVE PREDICTIVE VALUE. THE PROPOSED PROJECT RELIES HEAVILY ON COLLABORATIONS WITH OBSERVERS AND MODELERS ON THE LWS TEAM. OUR PLAN IS TO WORK WITH OBSERVERS ON THE TEAM TO COMPILE A DATABASE OF VARIABLES THAT CHARACTERIZE THE MAGNETIC ACTIVITY CYCLE DYNAMICS AND TO IDENTIFY CAUSAL VARIABLES THAT CONTROL THE DYNAMICS. WE WILL WORK WITH TEAM MODELERS TO EVALUATE THE OUTPUT FROM PREDICTIVE MODELS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ADEQUATELY CAPTURE THE SYSTEM DYNAMICS, AND WE WILL USE THE PRINCIPLE OF MAXIMIZATION OF INFORMATION TO CONSTRUCT PREDICTIVE MODELS FOR STARSPOT DYNAMICS.

GIVEN THE HIGH LAUNCH COST AND SHIFT TOWARD SMALLER PAYLOADS, REDUCING THE SIZE, WEIGHT, AND POWER (SWAP) OF SPACE-BASED NAVIGATION SYSTEMS IS A CRITICAL NEED. ATOM-INTERFEROMETRIC INERTIAL SENSORS HAVE DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE OVER CONVENTIONAL INERTIAL DEVICES OWING TO THE INTRINSIC STABILITY OF ATOMIC SYSTEMS. CENTRAL TO MAKING COLD ATOM SENSORS PRACTICAL IS THEIR ABILITY TO RELIABLY OPERATE FOR EXTENDED PERIODS WITHOUT USER INTERVENTION. CURRENT LASER DIODES, WHICH ARE AT THE HEART OF ATOMIC SENSORS, SUFFER FROM POWER DEGRADATION AND MODE HOPS ON TIMESCALES INCOMPATIBLE WITH LONG TERM DEPLOYMENT. BECAUSE THESE PROPERTIES ARE INHERENT TO THE DIODES, IT IS PRUDENT TO CIRCUMVENT THESE PROBLEMS WITH DIAGNOSTIC PROTOCOLS AIMED AT EARLY DETECTION AND ACTION. DIODES CLOSE TO MODE HOPPING CAN BE TEMPORARILY TAKEN OFFLINE TO TUNE AWAY THE MODE HOP VIA CURRENT AND TEMPERATURE. DIODES WITH DEGRADED POWER CAN BE TAKEN OFFLINE ENTIRELY IN FAVOR OF A HEALTHY DIODE. THIS APPROACH WILL PROVIDE A ROBUST, WAVELENGTH-AGNOSTIC TECHNIQUE TO DELIVER RELIABLE, LONG-LIVED LASER SOURCES AT ATOM SENSOR-RELEVANT WAVELENGTHS. AOSENSE PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A COLD ATOM LASER MODULE (CALM) CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING A BROAD RANGE OF ATOMIC SENSORS.

ATOM-INTERFEROMETRIC INERTIAL SENSORS HAVE DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE OVER CONVENTIONAL INERTIAL DEVICES OWING TO THE INTRINSIC STABILITY OF ATOMIC SYSTEMS. CENTRAL TO MAKING COLD ATOM SENSORS PRACTICAL IS THEIR ABILITY TO RELIABLY OPERATE FOR EXTENDED PERIODS WITHOUT USER INTERVENTION. CURRENT LASER DIODES, WHICH ARE AT THE HEART OF ATOMIC SENSORS, SUFFER FROM POWER DEGRADATION AND MODE HOPS ON TIMESCALES INCOMPATIBLE WITH LONG TERM DEPLOYMENT. BECAUSE THESE PROPERTIES ARE INHERENT TO THE DIODES, IT IS PRUDENT TO CIRCUMVENT THESE PROBLEMS WITH DIAGNOSTIC PROTOCOLS AIMED AT EARLY DETECTION AND ACTION. DIODES CLOSE TO MODE HOPPING CAN BE TEMPORARILY TAKEN OFFLINE TO TUNE AWAY THE MODE HOP VIA CURRENT AND TEMPERATURE. DIODES WITH DEGRADED POWER CAN BE TAKEN OFFLINE ENTIRELY IN FAVOR OF A HEALTHY DIODE.

THE SOLAR SYSTEM 12C/13C RATIO IS #tilde# 87, WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE 12C/13C OF THE SURROUNDING INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM (#tilde# 69). FURTHER, HIGH-RESOLUTION ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS TOWARD LOW-MASS YOUNG STELLAR OBJECTS (YSOS) HAVE REVEALED UNEXPECTED HETEROGENEITY IN GAS-PHASE [12C16O[/[13C16O] (HERETOFORE, 12CO/13CO), SUGGESTING THAT COMPLEX CHEMISTRY MAY BE AFFECTING PROTOPLANETARY CARBON RATHER THAN SUGGESTED DIRECT INHERITANCE FROM THE PARENT CLOUD. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO EXPLAIN ISOTOPIC OBSERVATIONS TOWARD YSOS, AND ACHIEVE A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERLYING CHEMISTRY AFFECTING EARLY CARBON RESERVOIRS IN THE SOLAR NEBULA THROUGH THE FOLLOWING: (1) OBSERVATIONS -WE WILL ANALYZE HIGH-RESOLUTION CO DATA OF BRIGHT YSOS ALONG A GALACTIC GRADIENT, OBSERVED WITH THE KECK TELESCOPE, AND INFORMED BY ARCHIVED KECK AND CRIRES DATA. RATIOS OF [12CO]/[13CO] DERIVED FROM THE DATA WILL BE INTERPRETED IN THE CONTEXT OF 12C/13C FROM OTHER CARBON-BASED RESERVOIRS (I.E., CO AND CO2 ICE) THAT ARE ALONG THE SAME LINE-OF-SIGHT, THEREBY ENABLING A DIRECT INVESTIGATION OF CARBON INHERITANCE IN EACH PROTOPLANETARY SYSTEM; (2) EXPERIMENTS - WE WILL PERFORM INTERSTELLAR ICE EXPERIMENTS TO EXPLORE CARBON FRACTIONATION PATHWAYS BETWEEN CO AND CO2 MOLECULAR RESERVOIRS, FURTHER AIDING IN THE INTERPRETATION OF ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS; AND (3) MODELS - WE WILL CREATE THEORETICAL MODELS TO HELP PARAMETERIZE OBSERVED ISOTOPE RATIOS AND FURTHER DEFINE THE CHEMICAL PATHWAYS ALONG EACH LINE-OF-SIGHT, TRACKING CHANGES IN THE CARBON-CONTAINING GAS AND ICE. OUR GOAL IS TO ADD SIGNIFICANTLY TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF CARBON EVOLUTION IN THE EARLY SOLAR NEBULA, AND HELP PUT THE SOLAR SYSTEM INTO A MEANINGFUL CONTEXT WITH RESPECT TO OTHER PROTOPLANETARY SYSTEMS. METHODOLOGY: HIGH-RESOLUTION ROVIBRATIONAL SPECTRA FROM NIRSPEC ON THE KECK TELESCOPE WILL BE USED TO DERIVE PRECISE ABUNDANCES FOR CO ISOTOPOLOGUES, INCLUDING 12C18O AND 12C17O, WHICH HELP CONSTRAIN THE ANALYSIS. OBSERVATIONS OF MASSIVE YSOS WILL BE LED BY THE PI AND COLLABORATOR BLAKE, AND OUR CUSTOMIZED CODES WILL BE USED FOR DATA REDUCTION AND ANALYSIS OF NEW AND ARCHIVAL DATA. A SET OF NEW DATA WILL BE OBTAINED TO FILL IN MISSING REGIONS OF THE GALACTIC GRADIENT. ARCHIVAL DATA FROM THE CRIRES AND KECK ARCHIVES WILL BE USED TO HELP CONSTRAIN 13CO ABUNDANCES, WHICH ARE USEFUL FOR INPUT INTO THE MODELS. CO-I GUDIPATI WILL LEAD THE EXPERIMENTS AT HIS JPL LAB, WHICH IS EQUIPPED TO EXPLORE MOLECULAR RESERVOIRS AND POTENTIAL FRACTIONATION MECHANISMS BETWEEN ISOTOPOLOGUES OF CO AND CO2 IN ICE AND GAS PHASES UNDER RELEVANT INTERSTELLAR CONDITIONS. THE CO MODELS LED BY CO-I WILLACY WILL TRACK GAS AND ICE ISOTOPE CHEMISTRY IN A RANGE OF SYSTEMS AIMED AT EXPLORING CO ICE- AND GAS-RESERVOIRS, USING APPROPRIATE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS. THE MODELS WILL DERIVE MOLECULAR ISOTOPE RATIOS ACROSS TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS IDENTIFIED FROM THE SPECTRAL ANALYSES. THE ENTIRE PROPOSAL TEAM WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE SCIENCE, AND THE PI WILL RECRUIT 3 STUDENTS/YEAR TO PARTICIPATE IN DEFINED ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT. RELEVANCE: THIS PROJECT IS RELEVANT TO MANY ASPECTS OF THE EMERGING WORLDS (EW) SCOPE, INCLUDING INVESTIGATIONS OF  PROCESSES THAT RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO THE CHEMICAL NATURE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM,   AND ADDRESSES THE RELEVANT TOPICS OF PROTOPLANETARY DISK FORMATION AND EVOLUTION (VIA UNDERSTANDING THEIR PRIMORDIAL CORE PHASES), LARGE-SCALE ISOTOPIC FRACTIONATION PROCESSES, AND CHEMICAL PROCESSING OF GAS AND ICE. FURTHER, OUR STUDY IS RELEVANT TO THE EW ENCOURAGEMENT OF INTERDISCIPLINARY WORK."

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF RECENT MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION AND GEODETIC ACCURACY OF LUNAR TOPOGRAPHIC DATA AS A BASIS FOR CALCULATIONS TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE SELENOLOCATION OF THE M3 DATA. ROOT-MEAN-SQUARED (RMS) POSITIONAL ERRORS WILL BE REDUCED FROM #tilde#200 M RELATIVE AND 450 M ABSOLUTE TO ON THE ORDER OF A PIXEL (140 M) OR BETTER, AND THE NUMEROUS IMAGES WITH GROSS POSITIONAL ERRORS OF KILOMETERS WILL BE CORRECTED. SECONDARILY, SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC ACCURACY WILL BE IMPROVED THROUGH THE USE OF A MUCH MORE DETAILED TOPOGRAPHIC MODEL IN PHOTOMETRIC CORRECTIONS AND MORE ACCURATE REGISTRATION TO THIS MODEL. TWO DATASETS WILL BE USED: (1) DIGITAL DATA FROM THE M3 PDS ARCHIVE, INCLUDING HYPERSPECTRAL DATA FROM TWO MAJOR OPTICAL IMAGING PERIODS, ANCILLARY DATA INCLUDING SPICE KERNELS, SELENOLOCATION FILES, AND ENGINEERING DATA SUFFICIENT TO REPRODUCE AND IMPROVE UPON EARLIER RAY-TRACING RESULTS (BOARDMAN ET AL., 2011; GREEN ET AL., 2011); AND (2) THE FULL-RESOLUTION (#tilde#100 M/PIXEL) DIGITAL TERRAIN MODEL (DTM) DERIVED FROM STEREO IMAGING OF THE WIDE ANGLE CAMERA (WAC) INSTRUMENT ON THE LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (E.G., SCHOLTEN ET AL., 2011). THE WORK CONSISTS OF FIVE MAJOR TASKS: (1) SYSTEMATIC REPROCESSING OF THE FULL DATASET THROUGH THE MISSION-DEVELOPED LEVEL 1B PROCESSING PIPELINE USING THE WAC DTM TO GREATLY IMPROVE SELENOLOCATION ACCURACY; (2) DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE TOOLS FOR PROCESSING M3 DATA MOST IMPORTANTLY, A PHYSICALLY RIGOROUS CAMERA MODEL IN THE USGS ISIS3; (3) USE OF THE ADVANCED CAPABILITIES OF ISIS TO CONTROL THE GLOBAL M3 DATASET WITH IMPROVED ACCURACY AND GENERATE FURTHER IMPROVED LEVEL 1B PRODUCTS; (4) SYSTEMATIC REPROCESSING OF BEST VERSION OF LEVEL 1B DATA THROUGH THE MISSION DEVELOPED LEVEL 2 PROCESSING PIPELINE USING THE WAC DTM TO GREATLY IMPROVE PHOTOMETRIC ACCURACY; (5) GENERATION OF A COMPLETE SET OF ORTHORECTIFIED AND MOSAICKED (LEVEL 3) DATA PRODUCTS INCLUDING PHOTOMETRICALLY NORMALIZED SPECTRA AND SPECTRAL PARAMETER MAPS; AND (6) DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS, WITH INTERIM RESULTS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE ONLINE AND FINAL SPICE KERNELS, LEVEL 1B AND LEVEL 3 PRODUCTS FORMALLY ARCHIVED TO THE IMAGING NODE OF THE PLANETARY DATA SYSTEM (PDS). THE MULTIPLE PRODUCTS GENERATED BY THIS EFFORT WILL SERVE THE BROADEST POSSIBLE SET OF SCIENTIFIC APPLICATIONS OF THE M3 DATASET. LEVEL 1B PRODUCTS, WHICH ARE NOT SPATIALLY RESAMPLED, ARE ESSENTIAL FOR STUDIES REQUIRING THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE SPECTRAL FIDELITY, AND THE IMPROVED SELENOLOCATION ACCURACY OF OUR RESULTS WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PHOTOMETRIC NORMALIZATION OF THESE DATA AND FACILITATE COMPARISON WITH OTHER DATASETS. THE RESAMPLED LEVEL 3 PRODUCTS WILL GREATLY SIMPLIFY THE USE OF M3 FOR REGIONAL STUDIES IN WHICH SUMMARY SPECTRAL CHARACTERISTICS SUFFICE. FINALLY, THE COMBINATION OF A FULL SET OF ISIS TOOLS PLUS IMPROVED SPICE DATA WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR USERS WHOSE SPECIAL NEEDS ARE NOT MET BY EITHER OF THESE PRODUCT SETS TO DO THEIR OWN M3 PROCESSING."

ASTS WILL ALSO DEMONSTRATE FEASIBILITY THAT WE CAN CUSTOMIZE THE COEFFICIENT OF THERMAL EXPANSION (CTE) IN THE SUBSTRATE MATERIAL BASED UPON INCREASING THE PERCENT SIC BY WEIGHT IN THE ALSI10MG BASE SUBSTRATE. AS WE ARE ABLE TO SELECT A SPECIFIC SIC-TO-ALSI10MG RATIO THAT HAS A CTE CLOSEST TO AN ELECTROLYTIC NICKEL-PLATING CTE, WE CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF MIRROR DEGRADATION OVER TIME DUE TO CTE MISMATCH-BASED STRESSES. FOR BOTH BERYLLIUM AND PURE SILICON CARBIDE AS A MIRROR SUBSTRATE, THE COST FACTOR AND RISK IS QUITE HIGH FROM A SCHEDULE PERSPECTIVE DUE TO BOTH THESE MATERIALS BEING VERY HARD AND BRITTLE. THEREFORE, MACHINING ANOMALIES IS A MUCH HIGHER RISK THAN OTHER METAL MIRROR SUBSTRATE MATERIALS. OUR ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING DEVELOPMENT OF SIC-AMC COULD BE A GAME CHANGER IN REDUCING THE FABRICATION COST AND SCHEDULE RISK FOR A MIRROR SUBSTRATE. ANOTHER KEY TECHNICAL RISK TO ADDRESS IS THE PROBLEM OF SMOOTHLY AND CONSISTENTLY APPLYING THE METAL POWDERBED OVER THE SLM BUILD PLATE. WE WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT WE CAN ELIMINATE PRACTICALLY ALL VOIDS AND POROSITY IN THE SIC-AMC BY TEAMING WITH PLASMA PROCESSES, INC. TO CREATE A SPHEROID SIC POWDER. BY THIS COMPANY DEVELOPING THE TECHNIQUE TO PRODUCE A SIC-AMC POWDER PRODUCT, WHICH WILL ALLOW ASTS TO MANAGE THE SIC-TO-ALSI10MG RATIO, WE CAN ASSURE A UNIFORM SIC DISTRIBUTION WITHIN THE ALUMINUM BASE. THROUGH THIS DEMONSTRATION, GREAT CONFIDENCE CAN BE OBTAINED TO CONTINUE MATERIAL DEVELOPMENT IN PHASE II, ESTABLISH ADDITIONAL SIC-AMC MATERIAL PROPERTIES AT HIGHER RATIOS OF SIC, AND DEVELOP WEIGHT EFFICIENT MIRROR SUBSTRATE DESIGNS THAT MEET NASA?S MISSION REQUIREMENTS."

OUR CHAMBER DESIGN, WHICH IS APPLICABLE TO FUTURE NASA SMALL LAUNCH VEHICLES, EXPLOITS THE COMBINED CAPABILITIES OF SELECTIVE LASER MELTING (SLM) AND MAGNETIC PULSE WELDING (MPW), IN ORDER TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING LEAD TIME AND COST AND TO IMPROVE QUALITY THROUGH EASE OF INSPECTION. THE BENEFITS OF SUCH A DESIGN ARE SUBSTANTIAL. FIRST, IT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT FOR COMPLICATED COMPONENTS LIKE A MODERN COMBUSTION CHAMBER, AN AM MANUFACTURING APPROACH CAN DRASTICALLY REDUCE COST (BY 50% OR MORE) AND LEAD TIME (WEEKS INSTEAD OF MONTHS). SECOND, OUR PARTICULAR DESIGN OVERCOMES WEAKNESSES OF OTHER ADDITIVE DESIGNS BY ENABLING EASY INSPECTION OF THE PRINTED PARTS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE TO UNDERGO CT SCANNING OR X-RAY INSPECTION, WHICH HAS PROVEN TO BE EXCEPTIONALLY DIFFICULT FOR COMPLEX INTERNAL GEOMETRIES LIKE REGENERATIVE COOLING CHANNELS AND PROPELLANT MANIFOLDS. THIRD, OUR BASIC MATERIAL AND MANUFACTURING APPROACH IS SCALABLE TO BOOSTER CLASS COMBUSTION CHAMBERS AT A RATE CONTROLLED SOLELY BY SCALING OF THE BUILD VOLUMES AVAILABLE IN COMMERCIAL SLM MACHINES (WHICH IS OCCURRING RAPIDLY). IN FACT, COMMERCIAL MPW SYSTEMS ARE ALREADY BEING USED IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY THAT CAN INSTANTANEOUSLY WELD PARTS OF SEVERAL METERS IN LENGTH."

THIS  GREAT OXIDATION EVENT  (GOE), WHICH WAS WELL UNDERWAY BY ABOUT 2.3 BILLION YEARS AGO, MADE LIFE LIKE US - AEROBIC LIFE - POSSIBLE. TO ELUCIDATE THE TIMING AND MECHANISM OF THIS CHANGE, WE NEED TO QUANTIFY SOURCES AND SINKS OF O2 (HOLLAND 2002; KASTING 2013; CATLING 2013). THE IMPORTANCE OF OXIDATIVE WEATHERING AS AN O2 SINK HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT TO CONSTRAIN. RECENT MODELS OF THE GOE INVOKE CHANGES IN CONTINENTAL CRUST COMPOSITION, AND THUS CHANGES IN THE CAPACITY OF OXIDATIVE WEATHERING TO CONSUME O2, TO EXPLAIN THE TIMING OF ATMOSPHERE OXYGENATION (E.G., LEE ET AL. 2016). HOWEVER, THESE MODELS ARE CONTENTIOUS AND POORLY CONSTRAINED BECAUSE THE RATES OF OXIDATIVE WEATHERING AT PRE-GOE LEVELS OF O2 ARE EXTRAPOLATED FROM EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED AT MUCH HIGHER PO2 (REINHARD ET AL. 2009; REINHARD ET AL. 2013). IMPROVING THESE MODELS REQUIRES HIGH-QUALITY EMPIRICAL DATA CONSTRAINING THE OXIDATION KINETICS OF CRUSTAL MATERIALS (ROCKS, SEDIMENTS, SOILS) CONDUCTED IN THE PO2 RANGE RELEVANT FOR ARCHEAN WEATHERING. HERE, I PROPOSE TO CONDUCT ULTRA-LOW PO2 EXPERIMENTS TO STUDY THE OXIDATION KINETICS OF MAJOR REDUCED SINKS SUCH AS BASALTS, KOMATIITES, AND ORGANIC-RICH BLACK SHALES AT PRE-GOE PO2. THIS WORK WILL BUILD ON EXPERIMENTS I HAVE ALREADY DONE WITH SULFIDES, AND WILL TELL US MORE ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE CONTINENTAL CRUST IN PROMPTING OR DELAYING THE GOE. TO DO THIS, I WILL USE RECENTLY DEVELOPED  LUMINESCENCE MEASURING OPTODE SENSOR  (LUMOS) TO MEASURE CONCENTRATIONS OF DISSOLVED OXYGEN DOWN TO SINGLE DIGIT NANOMOLAR CONCENTRATIONS (LEHNER ET AL. 2014). THESE LEVELS OF OXYGEN ARE UP TO THREE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE LOWER THAN THE LIMITS OF DETECTION ON PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED TECHNIQUES, AND BEGIN TO APPROACH THE LEVELS OF O2 CONSISTENT WITH AN ARCHEAN ATMOSPHERE (10-5 PRESENT ATMOSPHERIC LEVEL (PAL)   1 NM). USING A  CHEMOSTAT  DESIGN, I WILL CONDUCT OXIDATION EXPERIMENTS WITH LUMOS TO MEASURE KINETIC OXIDATION OF ARCHEAN SHALES, KOMATIITES, AND GRANITOIDS, AS WELL AS BASALTS OF VARIOUS COMPOSITIONS TO BEST APPROXIMATE THE ARCHEAN CONTINENTAL CRUST. THESE OXIDATION RATES WILL TELL US HOW EFFICIENTLY THE ARCHEAN CRUST MAY HAVE CONSUMED O2 PRIOR TO THE GOE, AND THUS PROVIDE CONSTRAINTS ON THE ROLE OF OXIDATIVE WEATHERING DURING THE OXYGENATION OF EARTH S ATMOSPHERE. GIVEN NASA S PLANETARY SCIENCE GOALS, THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS WELL-SUITED TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF LIFE ON EARTH TO GUIDE OUR SEARCH FOR LIFE ELSEWHERE. IN PARTICULAR, IT ADDRESSES THE FOLLOWING PLANETARY RESEARCH PROGRAM INVESTIGATION TOPICS: INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE ORIGINS, EVOLUTION, AND PROPERTIES OF THE ATMOSPHERES OF PLANETARY BODIES (INCLUDING SATELLITES, SMALL BODIES, AND EXOPLANETS), AND INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE ORIGIN AND EARLY EVOLUTION OF LIFE, THE POTENTIAL OF LIFE TO ADAPT TO DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS, AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR LIFE ELSEWHERE. THE WORK ADDRESSES THESE TOPICS BY TELLING US FOUR NEW THINGS: 1) IT WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND THE ROLES OF TECTONICS AND CRUSTAL COMPOSITION IN THE OXYGENATION OF PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES, 2) IT WILL INFORM OUR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT HOW COMMON O2 ATMOSPHERES MIGHT BE ON EARTH-LIKE EXOPLANETS, 3) IT WILL TEACH US ABOUT THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN BIOLOGICAL AND PLANETARY EVOLUTION IN SHAPING THE COMPOSITION OF PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES, AND 4) IT WILL GIVE US CONSTRAINTS ON THE AMBIENT PO2 AND OTHER CONDITIONS THAT WERE MET (IF NOT REQUIRED) BEFORE THE EVOLUTION OF EUKARYOTES AND LIFE LIKE US."

ALTHOUGH THE MASS GAIN FROM ICE SHEETS WILL DOMINATE A CENTURY FROM NOW, AT THE MOMENT DYNAMICAL ADJUSTMENTS OF THE OCEAN TO VARIABLE WINDS AS WELL AS THE CONTRIBUTION OF VERTICAL LAND MOTION (VLM) CAUSE MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT DEVIATIONS OF REGIONAL RELATIVE SEA LEVEL AWAY FROM THE GLOBAL MEAN. IT HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN SEVERAL REGIONS THAT THESE DYNAMICAL CHANGES IN MEAN SEA LEVEL EXCEED GLOBAL MEAN SEA LEVEL RISE BY A FACTOR OF THREE TO FOUR TIMES FOR PERIODS OF TWENTY YEARS OR LONGER. ONE EXAMPLE IS IN THE WESTERN PACIFIC, AND STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THIS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PACIFIC DECADAL OSCILLATION (PDO). WITH GROWING EVIDENCE FOR A CHANGE IN THE STATE OF THE PDO, THE WEST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES MAY BE IN STORE FOR RAPIDLY RISING SEA LEVEL OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY YEARS, OR LONGER. IT IS IMPORTANT TO QUANTIFY THE POSSIBLE SIZE. WE PROPOSE TO STUDY BOTH THE DYNAMICAL OCEAN SIGNAL, AND THE VERTICAL LAND MOTION IN COMBINATION, AS IT IS RELATIVE SEA LEVEL CHANGE THAT IS MOST IMPORTANT TO SOCIETY. VERTICAL LAND MOTION INCLUDES ONGOING GLACIAL ISOSTATIC ADJUSTMENT (FOR WHICH SEVERAL MODELS ARE AVAILABLE), SEDIMENT COMPACTION, TECTONIC SIGNALS AS WELL AS ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES DUE TO GROUNDWATER AND OIL EXTRACTION, AND POPULATION GROWTH. THE VLM HAS BEEN LITTLE STUDIED IN TERMS OF THE EFFECT ON REGIONAL SEA LEVEL. THUS, WE WILL EVALUATE IT ALONG THE ENTIRE PACIFIC, GULF, AND ATLANTIC COAST OF NORTH AMERICA USING GPS AND INSAR, WITH A FOCUS ON LARGE AND IMPORTANT COASTAL CITIES: SAN FRANCISCO, LOS ANGELES, SEATTLE, NEW YORK CITY, HOUSTON/GALVESTON, AND MIAMI. THE METHODS WE WILL USE ARE BRIEFLY SUMMARIZED BELOW: 1. WE WILL IDENTIFY THE RELEVANT MECHANISMS FORCING DECADAL- TO MULTI-DECADAL VARIATIONS IN REGIONAL MEAN SEA LEVEL AT SELECT LOCATIONS AROUND THE UNITED STATES BASED ON ANALYSIS OF TIDE GAUGE RECORDS AND A REGIONAL OCEAN MODEL NESTED WITHIN A GLOBAL GENERAL CIRCULATION MODEL. WE WILL QUANTIFY HOW WELL THE REGIONAL MODEL SEA SURFACE HEIGHT (AND/OR BOTTOM PRESSURE) MATCHES THE OBSERVED RECORD FROM TIDE GAUGES, QUANTIFY HOW THE VARIATIONS ARE RELATED TO LARGER-SCALE CLIMATE MODES (E.G., PDO, EL NI O, NORTH ATLANTIC OSCILLATION, ATLANTIC MUTIDECADAL VARIABILITY, ETC), AND ADJUST THE REGIONAL MODEL TO BETTER MATCH BOTH THE MAGNITUDE AND TIMING OF OBSERVED SEA LEVEL EVENTS. THIS WILL BE DONE VIA A COMBINATION OF REGIONAL SCALING, ADJUSTING FORCING PARAMETERS, AND/OR ADJUSTING SELECT PARAMETERS IN THE MODEL. ONCE THE REGIONAL MODEL IS VALIDATED, WE WILL USE PAST WIND RECORDS REPRESENTING PAST STATES OF THE CLIMATE SYSTEM (I.E., PDO WIND VARIABILITY FROM THE 1950S-1970S, ENSO WIND VARIABILITY FROM THE 1980S-1990S), AND FORCE THE MODEL TO MAKE PREDICTIONS OF POSSIBLE SEA LEVEL EXCURSIONS FOR THE NEXT TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS. 2. WE WILL UTILIZE GPS AND INSAR TO DETERMINE VERTICAL DISPLACEMENTS IN THE COASTAL REGIONS OF THE AFOREMENTIONED CITIES. INSAR PROVIDES DETAILED, COMPREHENSIVE BUT LOCALIZED OBSERVATIONS OF DISPLACEMENT IN THE SATELLITE LINE OF SIGHT AT PIXELS A FEW METERS APART. GPS WILL BE USED TO CALIBRATE INSAR, REDUCE INSAR ATMOSPHERIC AND BASELINE ERRORS AND DETERMINE INSAR RANGE RELATIVE TO THE (CM) MASS CENTER OF EARTH, THE IDENTICAL REFERENCE FRAME THAT SEA LEVEL FROM SATELLITE ALTIMETRY IS DETERMINED IN. INSAR MEASUREMENTS FROM ASCENDING AND DESCENDING PASSES WILL BE FURTHERMORE COMBINED WITH GPS TO DETERMINE TIME SERIES OF DISPLACEMENTS IN THREE DIMENSIONS. THE ACCURACY OF INSAR RELATIVE POSITION ESTIMATES OF SITES SEPARATED BY MORE THAN 50 KM WILL BE EVALUATED WITH GPS, PROVIDING AN INDEPENDENT CHECK OF THE ATMOSPHERE DELAY MODELS USED TO REDUCE THE INSAR DATA THE PROPOSAL TEAM INCLUDES EXPERTS ON REGIONAL OCEAN MODELING, TIDE GAUGES AND WIND-FORCED INTERANNUAL AND DECADAL-SCALE VARIATIONS IN SEA LEVEL, GPS, AND INSAR."

THE STELLAR ULTRAVIOLET (UV) RADIATION FROM M DWARFS IS STRONG AND HIGHLY VARIABLE, AND IMPACTS PLANETARY ATMOSPHERIC LOSS, COMPOSITION AND HABITABILITY. THESE EFFECTS ARE AMPLIFIED BY THE EXTREME PROXIMITY OF THEIR HZS (0.1 0.4 AU). JWST WILL CHARACTERIZE HZ M DWARF PLANETS AND ATTEMPT THE FIRST SPECTROSCOPIC SEARCH FOR LIFE BEYOND THE SOLAR SYSTEM. KNOWING THE UV ENVIRONMENTS OF M DWARF PLANETS WILL BE CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTANDING THEIR ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION AND A KEY PARAMETER IN DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN BIOLOGICAL AND ABIOTIC SOURCES FOR OBSERVED BIOSIGNATURES. THE UV FLUX EMITTED DURING THE SUPER-LUMINOUS PREMAIN SEQUENCE PHASE OF M STARS DRIVES WATER LOSS AND PHOTOCHEMICAL O2 BUILDUP FOR TERRESTRIAL PLANETS WITHIN THE HZ. THIS PHASE CAN PERSIST FOR UP TO A BILLION YEARS FOR THE LOWEST MASS M STARS. AFTERWARDS, UV-DRIVEN PHOTOCHEMISTRY DURING THE MAIN SEQUENCE PHASE STRONGLY AFFECTS A PLANET S ATMOSPHERE, COULD LIMIT THE PLANET S POTENTIAL FOR HABITABILITY, AND MAY CONFUSE STUDIES OF HABITABILITY BY CREATING FALSE CHEMICAL BIOSIGNATURES. OUR PROPOSED CUBESAT OBSERVATORY WILL BE THE FIRST MISSION TO PROVIDE THE TIME-DEPENDENT SPECTRAL SLOPE, INTENSITY AND EVOLUTION OF M DWARF STELLAR UV RADIATION. THESE MEASUREMENTS ARE CRUCIAL TO INTERPRETING OBSERVATIONS OF PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES AROUND LOW-MASS STARS. MISSION: THE STAR-PLANET ACTIVITY RESEARCH CUBESAT (SPARCS) WILL BE A 6U CUBESAT DEVOTED TO MONITORING 25 M STARS IN TWO UV BANDS: SPARCS FAR-UV (S- FUV: 153 171 NM) AND SPARCS NEAR-UV (S-NUV: 260  300 NM). FOR EACH TARGET, SPARCS WILL OBSERVE CONTINUOUSLY BETWEEN ONE AND THREE COMPLETE STELLAR ROTATIONS (4 45 DAYS) OVER A MISSION LIFETIME OF 2 YEARS. A UV CHARACTERIZATION SURVEY OF M DWARFS, THE MOST COMMON OF PLANET HOSTS, IS A PERFECT EXPERIMENT FOR A CUBESAT: -- UV ASTRONOMY CANNOT BE DONE FROM THE GROUND BECAUSE OF EARTH S ATMOSPHERIC ABSORPTION. -- PHOTOMETRY OF NEARBY SOURCES IS AN EFFICIENT USE OF A SMALL APERTURE. -- UNLIKE THE HST, WHOSE TIME IS SHARED AMONG MANY INSTRUMENTS AND PROGRAMS, A CUBESAT CAN PROVIDE DEDICATED SPACE-BASED LONG-TERM MONITORING IN THE UV. TECHNOLOGY: SPARCS WILL ADVANCE UV DETECTOR TECHNOLOGY BY FLYING HIGH QUANTUM EFFICIENCY (QE), UV-OPTIMIZED DETECTORS DEVELOPED AT JPL. THESE  DELTA-DOPED  DETECTORS HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF DEPLOYMENT DEMONSTRATING GREATER THAN 5X THE SENSITIVITY OF THE DETECTORS USED BY GALEX. SPARCS WILL PAVE THE WAY FOR THEIR APPLICATION IN MISSIONS LIKE LUVOIR OR HABEX. EDUCATION: THE SPARCS RESEARCH PROGRAM WILL TRAIN FUTURE SCIENTISTS AND MISSION LEADERS BY MENTORING FIVE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS, THREE GRADUATE STUDENTS, AND TWO POST-DOCTORAL SCHOLARS THROUGHOUT ALL ASPECTS OF THE MISSION, INCLUDING ENGINEERING, SCIENCE, DATA MANAGEMENT AND OUTREACH. RELEVANCE TO NASA: THE SPARCS MISSION WILL ADDRESS NASA S GOALS OF IDENTIFYING THE CHARACTERISTICS AND DISTRIBUTION OF POTENTIALLY HABITABLE ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING HZ PLANET HOSTS LIKE PROXIMA AND TRAPPIST-1. SPARCS WILL ALSO BE CAPABLE OF  TARGETOF- OPPORTUNITY  UV OBSERVATIONS OF NASA S TESS YIELD OF ROCKY PLANETS IN M DWARF HZS, SOME OF THE FIRST HZ PLANETS TO BE SPECTROSCOPICALLY CHARACTERIZED BY JWST. SPARCS CAN PROVIDE THE NEEDED UV CONTEXT FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF TRANSMISSION AND EMISSION SPECTRA OF THESE POTENTIALLY HABITABLE PLANETS. FURTHER INTO THE FUTURE, SPARCS RESULTS WILL INFORM THE TARGET STRATEGY FOR THE ENORMOUS TELESCOPIC INVESTMENTS IN EXOPLANET SCIENCE OF LUVOIR OR HABEX. SPARCS  TECHNOLOGY WILL FILL A GAP IN NASA S CAPABILITIES TO OBSERVE LOW-MASS STELLAR/PLANETARY SYSTEMS IN THE FUV AND NUV. HST S UV CAPABILITIES WILL NOT LAST MUCH LATER THAN 2019, WITH FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES (E.G., LUVOIR) NOT ARRIVING UNTIL SOMETIME AFTER 2035.

WE WILL USE BACKSCATTERED ELECTRON IMAGING AND ENERGY DISPERSIVE ANALYSIS WITH OUR FIELD-EMISSION SEMS TO CHARACTERIZE NANO-SCALE DEFORMATION, MELTING AND REACTION MICROSTRUCTURES. WE WILL USE THE FOCUSED-ION-BEAM LIFT-OUT TECHNIQUE TO PREPARE SAMPLES FOR ANALYTICAL TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (TEM). TEM WILL BE USED TO IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE NANO-MINERALOGY, NANOMETER-SCALE REACTION STRUCTURES, DEFORMATION MICROSTRUCTURES AND ANNEALING EFFECTS.

THROUGH PREVIOUS NASA GRANTS, WE HAVE COMPILED A SET OF VERY HIGH QUALITY FUV CROSS SECTIONS FOR CO ISOTOPOLOGUES.

WE WILL MODEL THESE EFFECTS DUE TO N2 SELF-SHIELDING USING HIGHLY PRECISE N2 CROSS SECTIONS. 4. NEBULAR SILICATES. EVALUATE O ISOTOPE EXCHANGE OF NEBULAR WATER WITH SILICATES AND CAIS. TO EXPLAIN THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM VIA SELFSHIELDING, NEBULAR SILICATES HAD TO EXCHANGE O WITH H2O. WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY ARGUED THAT SUCH EXCHANGE IS SLOW FOR CAIS.

SOLID-LIQUID INTERFACES SUPPORT SUCH SCALAR PERTURBATION FIELDS BY ADDING OR WITHDRAWING SMALL AMOUNTS OF THERMAL ENERGY. PRELIMINARY INSIGHTS SUGGEST THAT PERTURBATION FIELDS MODULATE INTERFACE MOTION AND CAN STIMULATE PATTERN FORMATION DEPENDING UPON THE INTERFACE''S CURVATURE DISTRIBUTION. HOWEVER, OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS THAT GOVERN THE INTENSITY OF CAPILLARY-MEDIATED FIELDS IS LIMITED TO PURE MELTS AND TO TWO SPATIAL DIMENSIONS. MOREOVER, ANY QUANTITATIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTENSITY THRESHOLD BEYOND WHICH SUCH CAPILLARY-MEDIATED FIELDS CAN POTENTIALLY MODULATE PATTERN FORMATION IS ALL TOGETHER, ABSENT. SURFACE CURVATURE AND CRYSTAL-MELT ANISOTROPY STRONGLY INFLUENCE BIAS FIELDS. MOTIVATED BY OUR RECENT DETECTION OF PERTURBATION FIELDS ON GRAIN BOUNDARY GROOVES (GBGS), WHICH ALSO APPEAR TO EXPLAIN THE ANOMALY REPORTED IN THE USMP-4 DATA, THE UNDERLYING HYPOTHESES WHICH WE INTEND TO TEST ARE: (A) WEAK CAPILLARY FIELDS THAT ARE RESIDENT ON SOLID-LIQUID INTERFACES, MODULATE THE SHAPES OF MELTING CRYSTALLINE FRAGMENTS, AND (B) SHAPE PERTURBATIONS FROM CAPILLARY FIELDS AMPLIFY ON UNSTABLE INTERFACES, AND INSTIGATE INSTABILITIES ON INTERFACIAL REGIONS OF EQUILIBRATED GBGS. OUR 3D PHASE-FIELD SIMULATIONS ON GROOVING WILL PROVIDE UNPRECEDENTED INSIGHTS INTO THIS FASCINATING AUTOGENOUS MECHANISM OF PATTERN FORMATION AND MIGHT ALSO ENABLE US TO DEVELOP NOVEL PROCESSING METHODS TO IMPROVE MICROSTRUCTURE-LEVEL CONTROL IN ALLOY CASTINGS.

A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW CHANGES IN GUT MICROBIOTA COMPOSITION IMPACTS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO INFECTION HAS BEEN LIMITED BY A LACK OF COST-EFFECTIVE, PHYSIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT INFECTION MODELS CONTAINING BOTH HUMAN HOST AND MICROBIAL CELLS. WE PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED AN ADVANCED THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3-D) MODEL OF HUMAN COLON CONTAINING INFLAMMATORY IMMUNE CELLS AND APPLIED IT TO STUDY HOST-PATHOGEN INTERACTIONS, INCLUDING THE INFLUENCE OF LOW FLUID SHEAR MICROGRAVITY ANALOGUE CULTURE ON THE ABILITY OF THE ENTERIC PATHOGEN SALMONELLA TO COLONIZE THE HOST. THIS SAME MODEL WAS ALSO APPLIED TO STUDY HOSTMICROBIOTA INTERACTIONS USING PATIENT-DERIVED FECAL CONSORTIA FROM BOTH HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS AND THOSE SUFFERING FROM A GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDER. FOR THE PROPOSED STUDY, OUR GOAL IS TO POPULATE OUR 3-D INTESTINAL CO-CULTURE MODEL CONTAINING IMMUNE CELLS WITH ASTRONAUT FECAL MICROBIOTA (PREVIOUSLY COLLECTED DURING THE MICROBIOME SPACEFLIGHT EXPERIMENT) AND ASSESS ITS INFLUENCE ON INFECTION WITH SALMONELLA CULTURED UNDER MICROGRAVITY ANALOGUE CONDITIONS. THE OUTCOME OF THESE INTERACTIONS WILL BE PROFILED USING A VARIETY OF APPROACHES, INCLUDING COLONIZATION STUDIES, MICROSCOPY, METABOLOMICS, 16S ANALYSIS AND CYTOKINE ANALYSIS. THE FOODBORNE PATHOGEN SALMONELLA WAS SELECTED AS THE MODEL PATHOGEN AS IT IS A LEADING CAUSE OF GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASE WORLDWIDE AND IMPOSES AN ENORMOUS HEALTH AND SOCIOECONOMIC BURDEN. FROM NASA􀁇S PERSPECTIVE, SALMONELLA IS CONSIDERED A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF INFECTION DURING SPACEFLIGHT THAT COULD INCAPACITATE CREW MEMBERS DURING A MISSION.

ADDITIONALLY, ILS HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED FOR THEIR ABILITIES TO SELECTIVITY DISSOLVE GASES, INCLUDING CARBON DIOXIDE. THESE MOLTEN SALTS OFFER SEVERAL BENEFICIAL ATTRIBUTES, INCLUDING FIXED CHARGE, TUNABLE MOLECULAR STRUCTURES (I.E., DESIGNER SOLVENTS/AGENTS), NEGLIGIBLE VOLATILITY, AND RELATIVELY HIGH THERMAL STABILITY. THE HYDROPHILICITY, DIELECTRIC CONSTANT, AND MANY OTHER ATTRIBUTES CAN BE ALTERED BY TUNING THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE (BOTH CATION AND ANION CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY VARIED), YIELDING TASK-SPECIFIC IONIC LIQUIDS FOR THE MANY APPLICATIONS NOTED ABOVE. THE INCORPORATION OF ILS INTO VARIOUS MEMBRANE PROCESSES HAS BEEN GAINING ATTENTION OVER THE PAST DECADE. THESE SUPPORTED IONIC LIQUID MEMBRANES (SILMS) HAVE BEEN USED FOR SELECTIVE CO2 CAPTURE, THOUGH PRIMARILY SELECTIVE AGAINST CH4 OR N2. ADDITIONALLY, COMMON CONCERNS FOR THEIR COMMERCIAL OR INDUSTRIAL IMPLEMENTATION INCLUDE 1) IL BLOW-OUT, WHEN THE PRESSURE DROP ACROSS THE MEMBRANE CAUSES THE IL TO LEAVE THE POLYMERIC SUPPORT AND 2) THICK MEMBRANES, WHICH LIMITS TRANSPORT. THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON DESIGNING NEW SUPPORT MATERIALS, PROCESSING THEM INTO LARGE SURFACE AREA CO2 CAPTURE MEDIA, AND ENGINEERING THEIR PERFORMANCE TO IMPROVE THE CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART. SPECIFICALLY, THE SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROPOSED PROJECT ARE: 1) PREPARE LIGHTWEIGHT, ROBUST, AND PROCESSABLE CHARGED POLYMERIC MEMBRANES CAPABLE OF A HIGH IL LOADING WITH NO DEMONSTRABLE IL LEECHING OR BLOWOUT, 2) OPTIMIZE CO2 PERM-SELECTIVITY AGAINST N2, O2, AND H2O, AND 3) STUDY THE SCALE-UP, PROCESSING, AND TECHNO-ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE MEMBRANES IN A MICROGRAVITY ENVIRONMENT. A SERIES OF POLY(ARYLENE ETHER SULFONE)S WILL BE PREPARED COMPRISING THE MONOMER DIALLYL BISPHENOL A. THIS MONOMER CONTAINS A PENDANT ALLYL FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH CAN BE FUNCTIONALIZED USING THIOL-ENE \CLICK\"" CHEMISTRY TO INTRODUCE ADDED FUNCTIONALITY.

THE MEMBRANE CHARACTERISTICS WILL BE CHARACTERIZED WITH DYNAMIC MECHANICAL ANALYSIS, ELECTROCHEMICAL IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY, ATOMIC FORCE AND SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY, SIZE EXCLUSION CHROMATOGRAPHY AND POSITRON ANNIHILATION LIFETIME SPECTROSCOPY. STRUCTURE-PROPERTY RELATIONSHIPS WILL BE ESTABLISHED, IN PARTICULAR RELATED TO SURFACE ROUGHNESS AND MEMBRANE FREE VOLUME, TO THE CO2 CAPTURE. THE MEMBRANES WILL THEN BE PROCESSED USING VARIOUS SOLUTION CASTING TECHNIQUES TO STUDY MEMBRANE POROSITY AND THE IMPACT ON IL LOADING, CO2 CAPTURE AND TRANSPORT, AND MEMBRANE STABILITY. THE IL [1-BUTYL-3-METHYLIMIDAZOLIUM][BIS(TRIFLUOROMETHYLSULFONYL)IMIDE] WILL BE IMPREGNATED INTO THE MEMBRANE, BASED ON ITS DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO SELECTIVELY DISSOLVE CO2. THE CO2 PERM-SELECTIVITY AND TRANSPORT PROPERTIES (TEMPERATURE- AND PRESSURE-DEPENDENT FLUX) WILL BE CHARACTERIZED AND THE SYSTEM WILL BE OPTIMIZED. FINALLY, THE PROTOTYPE DESIGN WILL BE ASSEMBLED IN A WAY THAT ENABLE EASE OF INSTALLATION AND OPERATION, A HIGH CO2 SCRUBBING CAPACITY WITH LIMITED POWER CONSUMPTION, AND INTEGRATION WITH FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES (E.G., CATALYTIC FORMATION OF CH4 OR OTHER CARBON-BASED MATERIALS OF INTEREST)."""

This is a critical concern, since a) tbe immune system of the crew is dysfunctional during spaceflight, b) spaceflight uniquely increases the virulence and globally alters gene expression of the human pathogen Salmonella typhimurium when the bacteria are recovered post-flight and subsequently used to infect ground-based animal models, c) spaceflight-induced increases in S. typhlmurium virulence are regulated by media ion composition, d) phosphate ion is sufficient to alter related pathogenesis responses In a ground-based spaceflight analogue model, and e) the evolutionarily conserved bacterial RNA chaperone protein, Hfq, serves as a master molecular regulator of many of these responses. While spaceflight has been shown to induce changes that can independently affect the host or the pathogen in a manner that is directly relevant to the development of infectious disease during spacefligbt - none of these studies have been done when both the host and pathogen are simultaneously exposed to the spaceflight environment. To address this knowledge gap, we propose to challenge the human surrogate model Caenorhabditis elegans with S. typhimurium during spaceflight to study the role of the intestine in host-pathogen interactions in real-time, define virulence mechanisms, identify evolutionarily conserved responses, and test novel therapeutic strategies to prevent infectious disease. We hypothesize tbat the combination of a spacefligbt-induced increase in virulence of the pathogen coupled with a blunted immune response of the host will result in a synergistic effect on tbe host-pathogen interactions such that the risk of infectious disease during spaceflight is exacerbated. We further propose that tbese responses represent evolutionarily conserved mechanisms at the level of both bost and pathogen that are dependent media ion composition, specifically the local concentration of phosphate."

WHILE THIS &quot;BETA_V&quot; METHOD IS APPROXIMATE IN NATURE, IN ITS FIRST APPLICATION TO A NEARBY LATE-TYPE SPIRAL GALAXY WE PRODUCED EXTINCTION MAPS AND REVEALED HIDDEN COHERENT GALAXY STRUCTURES LIKE A STELLAR BAR AND RIDGES OF DUST, WHILE ANOMALOUS INFERRED CENTRAL EXTINCTIONS IN SEVERAL EARLIER-TYPE DISK GALAXIES PROVED POWERFUL TRACERS OF HIDDEN AGN, INDEPENDENT OF RADIO, OPTICAL SPECTROSCOPIC, OR X-RAY OBSERVATIONS. THIS METHOD IS PARTICULARLY PROMISING FOR DEEP MID-IR IMAGING SURVEYS WITH THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE IN FIELDS ALREADY COVERED BY THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE (HST) IN VISIBLE LIGHT, SINCE THEIR ANGULAR RESOLUTIONS WILL BE WELL-MATCHED.  HERE WE PROPOSE TO EXPLORE THE APPLICABILITY, ROBUSTNESS, ACCURACY AND FIDELITY OF THE BETA_V METHOD ON LINEAR SIZE SCALES FROM PC TO KPC AND IN REGIONS OF VARYING STAR FORMATION HISTORIES, METALLICITIES, AND DUST CONTENT AND DISTRIBUTION. WE CAN DO SO BY COMBINING SPITZER/IRAC 3.6 MICRON AND NEWLY RELEASED WISE 3.4MICRON IMAGES OF BOTH MAGELLANIC CLOUDS (LMC+SMC) WITH GROUND-BASED 2MASS (AND DENIS) NEAR-IR IMAGES AND THE OGLE-III MULTI-YEAR V AND I REFERENCE IMAGES AND PHOTOMETRIC CATALOGS. THE LMC AND SMC ARE THE NEAREST ASTROPHYSICAL LABORATORIES WITH A RANGE OF SUB-SOLAR METALLICITIES. THEIR PROXIMITY AND WEALTH OF ARCHIVAL SPACE AND GROUND-BASED DATA PROVIDES FOR THE OVERCONSTRAINED BOUNDARY CONDITIONS NEEDED TO PERFORM THE PROPOSED ANALYSIS SUCCESFULLY.  SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL ASSESS AT #tilde#1&quot; OR #tilde#0.25--0.35PC (AT #tilde#0.1&quot; WHERE HST DATA IS AVAILABLE) RESOLUTION THE PROPERTIES OF THE STELLAR POPULATIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE FLUX IN EACH IRAC AND WISE RESOLUTION ELEMENT USING THE 2MASS, DENIS AND OGLE-III DATA. THAT ALLOWS US TO MEASURE THE OBSERVED AND DERIVE THROUGH MODELING THE INHERENT V-TO-3.6(3.4)MICRON FLUX RATIO PER IRAC(WISE)RESOLUTION ELEMENT. SUBSEQUENT RESAMPLING AND PSF-MATCHING AT GEOMETRICALLY INCREASING SCALES FROM PC TO KPC RESOLUTION ELEMENTS THEN ALLOWS US TO ASSESS THE ACCURACY AND FIDELITY OF THE METHOD AS A MULTI-VARIATE FUNCTION OF THE RESOLUTION, UNDERLYING STELLAR POPULATION MIXTURE, PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS, AND PROJECTED DISTRIBUTION OF DUST. THE RESULTING GRAPHS AND TABLES OF BIASES, CORRECTIONS, AND PREDICTED BETA_{V,0} WILL SERVE AS CALIBRATIONS IN THE APPLICATION OF THE SPATIALLY-RESOLVED EXTINCTION CORRECTION METHOD TO GALAXIES AT ALL REDSHIFTS OR THOSE REDSHIFTS WHERE THE METHOD IS PROVED RELIABLE."

A MAJOR LIMITATION OF REPEAT ALTIMETRY MEASUREMENTS, HOWEVER, IS THAT VARIATIONS IN THE DENSITY OF SURFACE ACCUMULATION AND THE FIRN LAYER MUST BE CONSTRAINED IN ORDER TO EXTRACT ICE THICKNESS AND MASS CHANGE. AS THINNING INITIATED AT THE MARGIN OF THE ICE SHEET PROPAGATES INLAND THIS LIMITATION IS BECOMING MORE PROBLEMATIC FOR TWO REASONS: FIRST, AS THINNING PROPAGATES AND DIFFUSES, THE RATE OF THINNING DECEASES RELATIVE TO VARIATIONS IN ACCUMULATION AND COMPACTION, BECOMING MORE DIFFICULT TO OBSERVE. SECOND, SUBSTANTIAL THINNING IS NOW OCCURRING IN THE WET SNOW AND PERCOLATION ZONES OF THE ICE SHEET WHERE VARIATIONS IN DENSITY ARE PARTICULARLY UNCONSTRAINED AND MODELS PERFORM POORLY.

THESE ARE KEY COMPONENTS OF BOTH THE NRC PLANETARY SCIENCE 2013-2022 DECADAL SURVEY AND THE NASA SMD 2007-2016 SCIENCE PLAN.

AT PRESENT, A ROBUST, LOW POWER, LOW MASS, SMALL FORM FACTOR, AND RELATIVELY LOW COST BROADBAND SEISMOMETER THAT CAN BE EMPLOYED ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF MISSION TYPES WITH VARIOUS DEPLOYMENT SCENARIOS DOES NOT YET EXIST. TO ACHIEVE THIS FIRST-ORDER GOAL, A NEXT GENERATION SEISMIC INSTRUMENT MUST BE DEVELOPED. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP THE INTEGRATED SEISMIC INSTRUMENT SYSTEM (ISIS), A COMPLETE BROADBAND MICRO-SEISMOMETER INSTRUMENT WITH COMPREHENSIVE LAB AND FIELD TESTING AND VALIDATION THAT WILL BE THE BASIS OF A FLIGHT INSTRUMENT THAT CAN BE PROPOSED FOR A RANGE OF SOLAR SYSTEM MISSIONS. ISIS DEVELOPMENT BUILDS UPON OUR SUCCESS IN DEVELOPING AN INNOVATIVE NEW MINIATURIZED SEISMIC SENSING ELEMENT UNDER A CURRENT NASA PLANETARY INSTRUMENT DEFINITION AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (PIDDP) GRANT.

WITH THE INTEGRATION AND COMPREHENSIVE TESTING, ISIS WILL BE BROUGHT TO TRL 4 AND POSSIBLY CLOSE TO 5 BY THE END OF THIS THREE-YEAR PROJECT. DEVELOPMENT OF ISIS WILL PROVIDE A FUNDAMENTALLY IMPROVED ADVANCEMENT IN THE TECHNICAL STATE OF SEISMIC INSTRUMENTATION AVAILABLE FOR FLIGHT OPPORTUNITIES. ITS DESIGN STEPS FAR BEYOND ANY CURRENT FLIGHT INSTRUMENTATION DUE TO ITS UNIQUE AND HIGHLY DESIRABLE COMBINATION OF CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING LOW MASS, LOW POWER USAGE, HIGH SHOCK TOLERANCE, LACK OF NEED TO LEVEL, BROADBAND SENSOR, AND FLEXIBILITY OF DEPLOYMENT. THE SYSTEM WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR A BROAD RANGE OF MISSIONS, ENABLING SEISMOLOGY TO BECOME A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF MANY MISSION SIZES AND TYPES SUCH AS A LUNAR NETWORK MISSION OR DEPLOYMENT ON AN ASTEROID OR ICY SATELLITE TO DETERMINE INTERIOR STRUCTURE OR CURRENT SEISMIC ACTIVITY.

WITH THIS PROPOSAL WE WISH TO COMPLETE OUR PROGRAM BY GEOLOGIC MAPPING OF ASCRAEUS MONS, THE ONLY THARSIS MONTES VOLCANO FOR WHICH A 1:1M MAP HAS NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED [CF., SCOTT AND ZIMBELMAN, 1995; SCOTT ET AL., 1998].

EACH OBJECTIVE UTILIZES TECHNIQUES THAT HAVE BEEN TESTED IN AN INITIAL STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE PRINCIPLE INVESTIGATOR AND GRADUATE STUDENT INVESTIGATOR. TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVE #1, THE MOON WILL BE DIVIDED INTO 12 TILES, EACH ENCOMPASSING #tilde#3 MILLION KM2. THE NEARSIDE MARIA WILL BE EXCLUDED FROM THE TILES USING THE AVAILABLE LRO MARE SHAPEFILE. THE LIGHT PLAINS WILL BE MAPPED TILE-BY-TILE WITH ARCGIS MAPPING SOFTWARE USING IMAGES FROM THE LRO WIDE ANGLE CAMERA (WAC) AS WELL AS A MAP OF THE STANDARD DEVIATION OF SLOPE DERIVED FROM THE GLOBAL LUNAR DIGITAL TERRAIN MODEL (GLD 100), WHICH IS USED AS A PROXY FOR ROUGHNESS. THE AVERAGE ELEVATIONS OF INDIVIDUAL LIGHT PLAINS DEPOSITS WILL BE MEASURED FROM THE GLD 100 AND ASSESSED RELATIVE TO THE RANGE OF ELEVATIONS OF THE MARIA TO DETERMINE IF THE LIGHT PLAINS ARE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS A LARGE RANGE OF ELEVATIONS, AS WE WOULD EXPECT IF THEY ARE IMPACT EJECTA, OR A NARROW RANGE, WHICH WOULD FAVOR A VOLCANIC ORIGIN LIKE THE MARIA. TO ADDRESS OBJECTIVE #2, IMAGES FROM BOTH THE LRO WAC AND NARROW ANGLE CAMERA (NAC) WILL BE EXAMINED TO IDENTIFY MORPHOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE LIGHT PLAINS AND LARGE LUNAR BASINS. USING EXISTING TOOLS WITHIN THE ARCGIS SOFTWARE PACKAGE, THE DISTRIBUTION OF LIGHT PLAINS WITH RESPECT TO INDIVIDUAL BASINS WILL BE ASSESSED BY DETERMINING HOW THE SURFACE COVERAGE OF LIGHT PLAINS VARIES WITH INCREASING DISTANCE FROM THE BASIN RIM. IF THE AREAL ABUNDANCE OF LIGHT PLAINS GRADUALLY DECREASES WITH INCREASING DISTANCE FROM THE BASIN RIM, THEN THE LIGHT PLAINS IN THE AREA BEING ASSESSED LIKELY ORIGINATED WITH THE FORMATION OF THAT BASIN. OBJECTIVE #3 WILL BE ADDRESSED BY EXAMINING BOTH WAC AND NAC IMAGES TO LOOK FOR CROSS-CUTTING AND SUPERPOSITION RELATIONSHIPS. USING THESE RELATIONSHIPS, WE WILL DETERMINE WHEN THE LIGHT PLAINS WERE DEPOSITED ON THE SURFACE. TO FURTHER CONSTRAIN THE AGE OF THE DEPOSITS, CRATER MEASUREMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED ON REPRESENTATIVE AREAS USING BOTH WAC AND NAC IMAGES. THE LUNAR CHRONOLOGY AND PRODUCTION FUNCTIONS OF NEUKUM ET AL. (2001) WILL BE APPLIED TO THE RESULTING DATASET TO CALCULATE THE ABSOLUTE MODEL AGES FOR THE LIGHT PLAINS. THESE AGES WILL THEN BE COMPARED TO BOTH FEATURES OF KNOWN AGES AND ABSOLUTE AGE ESTIMATES FOR FEATURES FOR WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE SAMPLES. IF WE FIND THAT THE MAJORITY OF LIGHT PLAINS CAN BE RELATED TO THE FORMATION OF LARGE BASINS, THEN WE WILL HAVE GAINED INSIGHT INTO THE DEGREE TO WHICH LARGE BASINS MODIFY THE SURFACE OF THE MOON, WHICH MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR OTHER PLANETARY BODIES.  IF WE FIND THAT THE LIGHT PLAINS CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY RELATIONSHIPS TO LARGE BASINS, THEN WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBILITY OF A VOLCANIC ORIGIN WITH OTHER PERTINENT DATASETS, SUCH AS COMPOSITIONAL DATA. IN THIS CASE, WE WILL HAVE IDENTIFIED A PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN STYLE OF VOLCANISM ON THE MOON. BOTH OF THESE OUTCOMES DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THIS NESSF SOLICITATION AND NASA S INTERESTS AS STATED UNDER THE PLANETARY SCIENCE RESEARCH PROGRAM AND THE VISIONS AND VOYAGES FOR PLANETARY SCIENCE IN THE DECADE 2013-2022 RESPECTIVELY: HOW HAVE THE MYRIAD CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROCESSES THAT SHAPED THE SOLAR SYSTEM OPERATED, INTERACTED, AND EVOLVED OVER TIME?

IN OUR PLANET FORMATION TASK, WE WILL MODEL MINERAL CONDENSATION AND PLANETARY ACCRETION IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS, TO DETERMINE THE RANGE OF ROCK/METAL COMPOSITIONS (E.G., MG:SI RATIOS) OF EXOPLANETS. WE WILL MODEL TRANSPORT OF WATER AND VOLATILES THROUGH DISKS, CONSIDERING PHOTOEVAPORATION BY NEARBY MASSIVE STARS AND CONSTRAINING OUR MODELS WITH ASTRONOMICAL AND METEORITIC OBSERVATIONS. WE WILL DETERMINE THE RANGE OF WATER CONTENT ON EXOPLANETS, IDENTIFYING FACTORS THAT LEAD TO WATER WORLDS OR DESERT PLANETS AND THE RELATIVE FREQUENCIES OF THESE EXOPLANET TYPES. IN OUR PLANETARY PROCESSES TASK, WE WILL MEASURE HIGH-PRESSURE MINERAL PROPERTIES AND CONSTRUCT ACCURATE MASS-RADIUS RELATIONS FOR EXOPLANETS. WE WILL MODEL THE INTERIORS AND MANTLE-SURFACE EXCHANGE IN REPRESENTATIVE EXOPLANETS, CALCULATING CONVECTION AND MIXING IN ICE VII MANTLES ON WATER WORLDS AND IN ROCKY MANTLES WITH VARIABLE MG:SI RATIO. WE WILL MODEL AND EXPERIMENTALLY CONSTRAIN EXOPLANETS SURFACE PETROLOGY, ASSESSING WHETHER ANDESITIC ROCK, CONTINENTS AND WEATHERABLE LAND CAN FORM. WE WILL PREDICT THE RATES OF GEOCHEMICAL CYCLES ON EXOPLANETS ACROSS THE FULL RANGE OF ELEMENTAL COMPOSITIONS AND WATER CONTENT. IN OUR COMPOSITIONS AND LIFE TASK, WE WILL CONDUCT FIELD STUDIES TO MEASURE METABOLIC RATES IN TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS THAT ARE ANALOGS TO WATER WORLDS (OCEAN GYRES), AND DESERT PLANET ENVIRONMENTS (SOIL CRUSTS IN THE SOUTHWEST, HOT SPRINGS IN OMAN AND YELLOWSTONE, SALTY LAGOONS IN CUATRO CIENEGAS, MEXICO). WE WILL PROBE THE GENETIC AND METABOLIC DIVERSITY AT THESE SITES, TO EXTRAPOLATE THESE METABOLIC RATES TO EXOPLANETARY ECOSYSTEMS. WE WILL INTEGRATE THESE INTERDISCIPLINARY EFFORTS BY COMPARING, FOR REPRESENTATIVE EXOPLANETS, THEIR ABIOTIC GEOCHEMICAL RATES WITH THEIR ECOSYSTEMS METABOLIC RATES. WE WILL DETERMINE THE RANGE OF EXOPLANET TYPES POSSIBLE, AND DEVELOP A METHOD TO PRIORITIZE FOR FUTURE STUDY THOSE TYPES THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO YIELD DETECTABLE EVIDENCE OF LIFE. OUR WORK ADDRESSES THREE GOALS OF THE 2008 ASTROBIOLOGY ROADMAP: GOAL 1, TO UNDERSTAND HABITABLE ENVIRONMENTS AND CHARACTERIZE EXOPLANET HABITABILITY; GOAL 5, TO UNDERSTAND THE LIFE''S ENVIRONMENTAL LIMITS AND MECHANISMS THAT CONTROL ITS EVOLUTION, METABOLIC DIVERSITY AND ACCLIMATIZATION; AND ESPECIALLY GOAL 7, DETERMINE HOW TO RECOGNIZE SIGNATURES OF LIFE ON OTHER WORLDS. WE WILL CONDUCT THIS RESEARCH IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH THE CAN6 VIRTUAL PLANET LAB (VPL) TEAM. WE WILL PROVIDE THE VPL TEAM WITH GEOCHEMICAL RATES ON EXOPLANETS NEEDED TO COMPLETE ITS TASK C (CALCULATE ATMOSPHERIC SIGNATURES). VPL WILL HELP US MAKE OBSERVATIONAL PREDICTIONS FROM OUR EXOPLANET MODELS. OUR FOCUS ON INTERIORS AND SURFACES AND VPL''S FOCUS ON EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERES PERFECTLY COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER."

AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS AND HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS ARE FAMILIAR CONSEQUENCES WITH IMPRESSIVE CAPACITIES FOR ROCK ALTERATION, ELEMENT TRANSPORT, AND TRANSFORMATION OF ORGANIC AND INORGANIC VOLATILE COMPOUNDS. LESS FAMILIAR ARE TRANSPORT, REDISTRIBUTION, AND TRANSFORMATION PROCESSES THAT OCCUR IN CARBONIC (CO2-RICH) FLUIDS, WHICH ARE POSTULATED TO ALSO BE PRODUCTS OF ACCRETION AND DIFFERENTIATION PROCESSES. THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO GENERATE MODELS OF HOW CARBONIC RICH FLUIDS TRANSFORM OTHER VOLATILE CONSTITUENTS OF SOLAR-SYSTEM BODIES EARLY IN THEIR EVOLUTION. THE OBJECTIVES ARE TO PROVIDE THE TOOLS FOR PLANETARY SCIENTISTS TO TEST IDEAS ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CARBONIC FLUIDS IN TRANSPORTING, REDISTRIBUTING, AND TRANSFORMING ORGANIC COMPOUNDS DURING EARLY STAGES OF FORMATION OF SOLAR-SYSTEM BODIES. THESE THEORETICAL TOOLS WILL ALLOW TESTS OF THE CONSEQUENCES AND RELATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF CARBONIC AND AQUEOUS FLUIDS IN THE TRANSFORMATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS INHERITED FROM THE SOLAR NEBULA. EXISTING SOLUBILITY DATA IN CARBONIC FLUIDS FOR MAJOR CLASSES OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS WILL BE SUMMARIZED AND CRITIQUED. THESE DATA WILL INCLUDE COMPOUNDS FOUND IN METEORITES AND THOUGHT TO BE PRESENT EARLY IN SOLAR SYSTEM HISTORY INCLUDING ALKANES, POLYCYCLIC AROMATICS, AMINES, CARBOXYLIC ACIDS AND AMINO ACIDS. METHODOLOGY: SOLUBILITY DATA WILL BE FIT WITH EQUATIONS THAT DEPEND ON TEMPERATURE AND DENSITY. THE BASIS FOR THIS TREATMENT WILL BE THE MOST UP-TO-DATE AND ACCURATE EQUATION OF STATE FOR CO2, WHICH IS WELL-CALIBRATED OVER THE RANGES OF TEMPERATURES AND PRESSURES OF PLANETARY PROCESSES. NUMEROUS SETS OF DATA ON THE SOLUBILITY OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS IN CO2 WILL BE USED TO CHARACTERIZE THE BEHAVIOR OF ORGANIC SOLUTES IN CARBONIC FLUIDS, TO GENERATE A DATABASE OF THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES, AND TO SEARCH FOR CORRELATIONS TO BUILD ESTIMATION ALGORITHMS. THE RESULTS WILL BE COMBINED INTO COMPUTER CODES FOR PREDICTING THE THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF REACTIONS OCCURRING IN CO2 SOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTED IN MODEL CALCULATIONS TO TEST HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE TRANSPORT, REDISTRIBUTION, AND TRANSFORMATION OF VOLATILE COMPOUNDS IN CARBONIC FLUIDS ON SOLAR-SYSTEM BODIES.

YET ALTERNATIVE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS REMAIN ELUSIVE, AND PRIVATE CAPITAL REMAINS SKEPTICAL. NEITHER BANKS NOR VENTURE CAPITAL FIRMS ARE ESPECIALLY WILLING, IN THE CURRENT FINANCIAL ENVIRONMENT, TO INVEST EVEN SMALL AMOUNTS IN SPECULATIVE ENDEAVORS THAT POSE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL RISK WITHOUT CLEAR ROUTES TO PROFITABILITY.

INSTEAD, AN INCREMENTAL APPROACH TO BUSINESS INVESTMENT IS TAKEN THAT RESTS ON WELL-PROVEN FINANCIAL AND RISK MODELS. THANKS IN LARGE PART TO NASA THE TECHNICAL CHALLENGES OF LAUNCHING PAYLOADS INTO LOW EARTH ORBIT ARE WELL UNDERSTOOD, BUT THE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES REMAIN. WHAT WE NEED ARE NOVEL, INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO THE FINANCING OF SPACE EXPLORATION. TO IDENTIFY AND DEFINE THEM WE HAVE TO START WITH STIMULATING IDEAS THAT CAN HELP INSPIRE CREATIVE THINKING IN FINANCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN THE SPACE SECTOR.

THESE IMAGES WERE LATER REDUCED INTO A GLOBAL MULTISPECTRAL MOSAIC AND A SERIES OF MINERALOGY AND MATURITY MAPS [3 AND REFERENCES THEREIN], WHICH WERE USED IN NUMEROUS STUDIES TO ADVANCE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE LUNAR SURFACE. AFTER THE MISSION, TWO EFFORTS WERE MADE TO IMPROVE THE GEODETIC ACCURACY OF AVAILABLE CARTOGRAPHIC PRODUCTS: CLEMENTINE LUNAR CONTROL NETWORK (CLCN) [4] AND THE UNIFIED LUNAR CONTROL NETWORK (ULCN) 2005 [5]. WITH THE SUCCESS OF THE GRAVITY RECOVERY AND INTERIOR LABORATORY (GRAIL) MISSION AND THE LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (LRO) OUR KNOWLEDGE OF LUNAR GRAVITY, TOPOGRAPHY, AND THE LOCATION OF FEATURES ON THE SURFACE HAS IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY (ELEVATIONS WITHIN 20 M AND GEODETIC ACCURACY<45 M WITHOUT GROUND CONTROL POINTS) [6,7].

THE PRIMARY CONCEPT IS THE REALIZATION OF A HIGH TEMPERATURE, HIGH EFFICIENCY TANDEM SOLAR CELL DEVICE BASED ON INGAN MATERIALS. AS IS WELL KNOWN, THE INXGA1XN TERNARY COMPOUND SYSTEM HAS A RANGE OF BANDGAPS BASED ON THE MOLE FRACTION, X, OF IN THAT SPANS THE ENTIRE SOLAR SPECTRUM. FURTHERMORE, NITRIDE BASED ELECTRONICS AND OPTOELECTRONICS ARE DEMONSTRATED TO OPERATE AT HIGH TEMPERATURES  400 C AND ARE THE BASIS FOR HIGH POWER, HIGH TEMPERATURE ELECTRONICS. THEY ALSO SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR A RAPIDLY GROWING WHITE LIGHT EMITTING DIODE LED MARKET, WITH WELL ESTABLISHED ROADMAPS FOR COST REDUCTION AND MANUFACTURABILITY. THE FOLLOWING KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PROPOSED SOLAR CELL ALLOW HIGH EFFICIENCY AND HIGH TEMPERATURE OPERATION.   A TWO JUNCTION INGAN BASED TANDEM SOLAR CELL STRUCTURE TO EXCEED THE NASA TARGET SOLAR CELL EFFICIENCY GOALS  25 OPERATING AT OR NEAR THE OPERATING TEMPERATURE OF THE SOLAR THERMAL SYSTEM.  ADVANCED DEVICE STRUCTURES AND FABRICATION METHODS SUITABLE FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE OPERATION SUCH AS HIGH THERMAL STABILITY METAL CONTACT METALLURGY WITH LOW SPECIFIC CONTACT RESISTANCE AND ALL NITRIDE BASED SEMICONDUCTOR COMPONENTS.  NOVEL HETEROSTRUCTURE CARRIER SELECTIVE CONTACT STRUCTURES IN THE ABSORBER LAYER TO INCREASE OPEN CIRCUIT VOLTAGE AND RELAX THE DOPING REQUIREMENTS IN THE PHOTOACTIVE REGIONS.  THERMIONIC ESCAPE FROM  SHALLOW  QUANTUM WELLS QWS THAT ACHIEVES HIGH EFFICIENCY THROUGH INCREASED PHOTOCARRIER COLLECTION AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES.  A FLEXIBLE DEVICE TECHNOLOGY TO ALLOW FOR CONFORMAL MOUNTING OF THE SOLAR CELL DEVICE TO THE TARGET SOLAR THERMAL TECHNOLOGY, AND REDUCE SUBSTRATE AND RELATED MATERIAL COSTS.  ADVANTAGES THE PROPOSED III NITRIDE SOLAR CELL HAS NUMEROUS ADVANTAGES IF INTEGRATING INTO A CONCENTRATED SOLAR POWER CSP SYSTEM, RELATING TO ITS PERFORMANCE, COST, SCALABILITY AND FEASIBILITY. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROPOSED INGAN SOLAR CELL ALLOWS A SYSTEM WITH HIGHER EFFICIENCY AND LOWER COSTS THAN ANY OTHER SOLAR BASED ELECTRICITY SYSTEM, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ALLOWING A LARGE FRACTION OF DISPATCHABLE ELECTRICITY, THUS ADDRESSING THE MAJOR PRESENT DRAWBACK WITH PV SYSTEMS. FURTHERMORE, THROUGH THE EXISTING LED INDUSTRY, THE DEVICES HAVE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED RELIABILITY AND SCALABILITY. FINALLY, THE ABILITY TO MAKE HIGH PERFORMANCE HIGHER BANDGAP INGAN SOLAR CELLS HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED. THESE ADVANTAGES ARE SUMMARIZED IN  TABLE I OF THE FULL PROPOSAL.  IMPACTS AND INFUSION THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGH EFFICIENCY INGAN SOLAR CELL ENABLES A TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE IN THE ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY GENERATE POWER WITHOUT CONCERNS OF OPERATIONAL TEMPERATURES, WHICH IS A KEY REQUIREMENT FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS. THE KEY ASPECTS OF THE APPROACH ARE TO CAPITALIZE ON THE UNIQUE PROPERTIES OF THE III NITRIDE MATERIALS SYSTEMS, WHICH EXCLUSIVELY AMONG COMMERCIAL SEMICONDUCTORS ALLOW HIGH TEMPERATURE OPERATION. FURTHER, WE CAPITALIZE ON THE RAPID GROWTH INDUSTRIES BASED ON THE III NITRIDES SUCH AS SOLID STATE LIGHTING, WHICH DRIVES BOTH TECHNICAL INNOVATION AND REDUCED COSTS. A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF THE RESEARCH WILL BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO VARIOUS NASA MISSIONS AS POWER GENERATION IS CRITICAL TO SPACE TECHNOLOGY, ESPECIALLY FOR SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE SMD MISSIONS FOCUSED ON DESTINATIONS CLOSER TO THE SUN. OTHER IMPACT INCLUDES ENABLES A TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE IN THE ABILITY TO INTEGRATE RENEWABLE ENERGY INTO THE ELECTRICITY GRID."

IT IS A WORLD WHERE TIDES ARE THE DOMINANT PROCESS, CONTROLLING BOTH SURFACE MODIFICATION AND INTERIOR STRUCTURE. WE NOW KNOW THAT EUROPA IS NOT UNIQUE; TINY, ICE-COVERED ENCELADUS DISPLAYS TECTONIC ACTIVITY, PLUME ERUPTIONS, AND HIGH HEAT FLOW THAT ARE ALL LIKELY GOVERNED BY TIDES. STUDYING TIDAL-TECTONIC PROCESSES ON EUROPA PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR INTERPRETING SURFACES OF ALL BODIES IN WHICH TIDES PLAY A ROLE. HOWEVER, FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THESE TECHNIQUES IS REQUIRED TO FULLY UNDERSTAND TIDAL-TECTONIC PROCESSES AND INTERPRET THE DYNAMICAL, TIDAL, AND INTERIOR EVOLUTION RECORDED ON EUROPA''S SURFACE. TECTONIC ACTIVITY ON EUROPA HAS BEEN LINKED TO TIDAL STRESS CAUSED BY ITS ECCENTRIC ORBIT, FINITE OBLIQUITY, AND POSSIBLY NON-SYNCHRONOUS ROTATION OF THE ICY SHELL. CYCLOIDS AND OTHER LINEAMENTS ARE THOUGHT TO FORM IN RESPONSE TO TIDAL NORMAL STRESS WHILE STRIKE-SLIP MOTION ALONG PREEXISTING FAULTS HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO TIDAL SHEAR STRESS. TECTONIC FEATURES CAN THUS PROVIDE CONSTRAINTS ON THE ROTATIONAL PARAMETERS THAT GOVERN TIDAL STRESS AND INSIGHT INTO THE TIDAL-TECTONIC PROCESSES OPERATING ON ICE-COVERED OCEAN BODIES. TIDAL-TECTONIC FORMATION MODELS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT FITTING LARGE-SCALE TRENDS IN THE POPULATIONS OF CYCLOIDS, STRIKE-SLIP FAULTS, AND LINEAMENTS, AS WELL AS REPRODUCING THE PATHS OF INDIVIDUAL CYCLOIDS. HOWEVER, SIMPLIFICATIONS IN THE TIDAL STRESS CALCULATIONS AND IN THE ROLE OF EUROPA''S INTERIOR STRUCTURE HAVE LED TO LIMITATIONS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY EXPLORED. IN PAST TIDAL-TECTONIC MODELING EFFORTS, EUROPA''S ICE SHELL HAS BEEN TREATED AS UNIFORM AND ELASTIC, OVERLYING A GLOBAL OCEAN. HOWEVER, THE DEPTH-DEPENDENT VISCOELASTIC NATURE OF ICE SHELLS WILL AFFECT LONG-TERM SOURCES OF STRESS, INCLUDING NON-SYNCHRONOUS ROTATION. IN FACT, VISCOUS RELAXATION HAS EVEN BEEN SHOWN TO CAUSE A PHASE LAG IN DIURNAL TIDAL STRESS. THE EFFECT OF THESE CHANGES ON FRACTURE FORMATION HAS YET TO BE INVESTIGATED. IN ADDITION, IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT EUROPA''S GEOLOGIC ACTIVITY HAS CHANGED OVER TIME. ONE THEORY IS THAT EUROPA''S FRACTURES ARE OLDER, HAVING FORMED WHEN THE ICE WAS RELATIVELY THIN, WHEREAS CHAOS FEATURES ARE YOUNGER AND FORMED THROUGH CONVECTION IN A THICKER SHELL. SIMILARLY, LINEAMENTS AND CYCLOIDS ARE BOTH THOUGHT TO BE TIDALLY-DRIVEN TENSILE FRACTURES, AND YET, DISPLAY VERY DIFFERENT MORPHOLOGIES. IT HAS BEEN PROPOSED THAT CYCLOIDS FORMED AT A TIME WHEN DIURNAL STRESSES DOMINATED WHEREAS LINEAMENTS FORMED WHEN NON-SYNCHRONOUS ROTATION (NSR) STRESSES DOMINATED. EVEN FOR THE SAME ROTATION PERIOD, THE STRESSES INDUCED BY NSR CAN CHANGE DRAMATICALLY BASED ON THE RHEOLOGY OF THE ICE SHELL. VARIATIONS IN ECCENTRICITY OR OBLIQUITY COULD AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF HEAT DISSIPATED WITHIN EUROPA; CHANGES IN HEAT COULD ALTER THE VISCOSITY OF THE ICE SHELL, PERHAPS DRIVING DIFFERENT TYPES OF GEOLOGIC ACTIVITY ON EUROPA. WE PROPOSE TO INCORPORATE RHEOLOGY-DEPENDENT TIDAL STRESS EQUATIONS INTO EXISTING TIDAL-TECTONIC MODELS AND TEST OUR MODEL PREDICTIONS AGAINST OBSERVED CYCLOIDS, LINEAMENTS, AND STRIKE-SLIP FAULTS.WE WILL THEN ASSESS THE ROLE OF NONSYNCHRONOUS ROTATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF TIDAL-TECTONIC FEATURES AND TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE RHEOLOGY OF EUROPA''S ICE SHELL HAS CHANGED WITH TIME."

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS A MODEL FREE OF ADJUSTABLE TUNING PARAMETERS. TO THAT END, A NOVEL DUAL SCALE LES APPROACH IS PROPOSED TO PREDICT THE PRIMARY ATOMIZATION PROCESS CLOSE TO THE FUEL INJECTOR. INSTEAD OF RELYING ON THE TRADITIONAL LES MODELING PARADIGM THAT DYNAMICS ON THE UNRESOLVED SUB-FILTER SCALE FOLLOW A CERTAIN UNIVERSALITY AND CAN BE INFERRED SOLELY FROM THE DYNAMICS ON THE RESOLVED SCALES, THE DUAL SCALE APPROACH AIMS TO MAINTAIN A REPRESENTATIVE FULLY RESOLVED REALIZATION OF THE LIQUID/GAS PHASE INTERFACE GEOMETRY.

IN ADDITION, NEAR THE INJECTOR, IN THE DENSE SPRAY REGIME, THE DROPLET-DROPLET INTERACTIONS, DROPLET DEFORMATION AND INTERNAL CIRCULATION EFFECTS ON THE DRAG AND LIFT FORCES CAN BE IMPORTANT.

RECENT REVIEW WORK HAS SHOWN THAT A VERITABLE REVOLUTION IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN IN ASTRONOMICAL DIAGNOSTIC WORK FOR TARGETS RANGING FROM PROTOSTELLAR AND PROTOPLANETARY SYSTEMS, TO THE INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM THAT FEEDS GAS SUPPLIES FOR GALACTIC STAR FORMATION, TO THE MOST DISTANT OF OBJECTS IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE.

ALTHOUGH THE ASTEROID BELT IS THE MAIN SOURCE OF IMPACTORS IN THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM TODAY, IT CONTAINS ONLY 0.05 LUNAR MASSES OF MATERIAL. WHILE THE ASTEROID BELT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE MASSIVE WHEN IT FORMED, IT IS UNLIKELY TO HAVE HAD GREATER THAN A LUNAR MASS SINCE THE FORMATION OF JUPITER AND THE DISSIPATION OF THE SOLAR NEBULA. BY COMPARISON, GIANT IMPACTS ONTO THE TERRESTRIAL PLANETS DURING THE LATE STAGE OF ACCRETION TYPICALLY RELEASED DEBRIS EQUAL TO SEVERAL PER CENT OF THE PLANET''S MASS INTO HELIOCENTRIC ORBIT. THE MOON-FORMING IMPACT ON EARTH, FOR EXAMPLE, RELEASED OVER A LUNAR MASS OF DEBRIS, MORE THAN HAS EVER BEEN CONTAINED IN THE ASTEROID BELT. THE BOREALIS BASIN IMPACT ON MARS RELEASED MORE DEBRIS AT ONCE, THAN THE PRESENT DAY ASTEROID BELT. ESCAPING IMPACT DEBRIS IS LESS LONG LIVED THAN THE MAIN ASTEROID BELT, AS IT IS INJECTED ON UNSTABLE, PLANET-CROSSING ORBITS. THIS SAME FACTOR HOWEVER ALSO INCREASES THE IMPACT PROBABILITY WITH THE TERRESTRIAL PLANETS AND ASTEROIDS. WITH SUCH A LARGE AMOUNT OF MASS IT SEEMS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT THESE NOW-EXTINCT POPULATIONS OF IMPACTORS SHOULD HAVE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM, MUCH AS NOW-EXTINCT RADIONUCLIDES PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE THERMAL HISTORIES OF SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES. ONE OF THE MOST OBVIOUS EFFECTS OF RE-IMPACTING DEBRIS IS THE PRODUCTION OF CRATERS. THE MOON, MARS, MERCURY AND THE LARGEST ASTEROIDS MAY BE EXPECTED TO DISPLAY EVIDENCE OF RE-IMPACTING BOMBARDMENTS IN THEIR CRATER RECORD, SUBJECT TO THEIR THERMAL STATE AND SUBSEQUENT SURFACE RE-PROCESSING. HOWEVER, IN UNDERSTANDING THE CRATERING HISTORY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM, THE CONTRIBUTION OF GIANT IMPACT DEBRIS HAS BEEN ALMOST UNIVERSALLY NEGLECTED, AND CONSTRAINING THIS CONTRIBUTION CONSTITUTES OUR PRIMARY TASK. IN ADDITION TO THE PRODUCTION OF SURFACE CRATERS, LARGE IMPACTS CAN PUNCH THROUGH THE LITHOSPHERE AND EXHUME MATERIAL FROM LARGE DEPTHS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY PERTINENT FOR RE-IMPACTS ONTO A PROGENITOR BODY WHICH WILL HAVE A DEEP MAGMA OCEAN AFTER THE GIANT IMPACT. DEPENDING ON THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF THE TARGET, THIS MAGMA OCEAN MAY FORM A FLOTATION CRUST AS ON THE MOON AND PERHAPS MERCURY, THAT WOULD ACT AS AN INSULATING BLANKET. IMPACTORS THAT PUNCH THROUGH OR DISRUPT THIS CRUST MAY ALLOW THE MAGMA OCEAN TO COOL FASTER. CONVERSELY, FOR MAGMA OCEANS THAT FREEZE FROM THE BOTTOM UP, THE ENERGY INPUT FROM RE-IMPACTS MAY KEEP THEM LIQUID FOR LONGER. THIS FEEDS BACK INTO THE CRATERING RECORD AS CRATERS WILL ONLY BE RECORDED ONCE THERE IS A STABLE, SOLID SURFACE. IN THIS SENSE THE DYNAMICS OF GIANT IMPACT DEBRIS CAN IN PRINCIPLE BECOME A CHRONOMETER OF PLANETARY SOLIDIFICATION. THE INFLUENCE OF LONG TERM RE-ACCUMULATION ON PLANETARY THERMAL EVOLUTION IS OUR SECOND TASK. OUR THIRD TASK IS TO STUDY RE-IMPACTING DEBRIS AS AN ASPECT OF TERRESTRIAL SATELLITE FORMATION. THE MOON, PHOBOS AND DEIMOS LIKELY FORMED FROM CIRCUMPLANETARY DEBRIS DISKS. THESE DISKS DID NOT EXIST IN ISOLATION. THEY, AND THE SATELLITES THAT FORM FROM THEM, WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO RE-IMPACTS BY RETURNING DEBRIS FROM THEIR FORMATIVE GIANT IMPACTS. WHETHER SUCH DISK IMPACTS WOULD HAVE AIDED OR HINDERED SATELLITE FORMATION IS UNCLEAR."

TECTONIC ACTIVITY IS WIDESPREAD ON DIONE AND RHEA, WHILE TETHYS HAS LIMITED TECTONIC ACTIVITY, AND MIMAS HAS AN ANCIENT, HEAVILY CRATERED SURFACE, NEARLY DEVOID OF FRACTURES. HOWEVER, NO GLOBAL CATALOGUE OF TECTONIC FEATURES YET EXISTS FOR DIONE OR RHEA. THE SOURCE OF STRESS THAT CAUSED SUCH A DIVERSITY OF FRACTURING IS CURRENTLY UNKNOWN. OBSERVATIONS OF CRATER RELAXATION AND FLEXURE IMPLY A HIGHER HEAT FLOW ON DIONE AND RHEA THAN PREDICTED FROM CLASSIC MODELS OF THEIR FORMATION AND EVOLUTION. SUCH HIGH HEAT FLOWS MAY EVEN HAVE MAINTAINED SUBSURFACE OCEANS ON THESE MOONS, WHICH COULD HAVE ALLOWED ENHANCED TIDAL ACTIVITY AND, PERHAPS, TIDALLY-DRIVEN FRACTURING. NEW SATELLITE FORMATION MODELS HAVE DIFFERENT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EXTENT AND TIMING OF INTERNAL HEATING, THE PRESENCE OF AN OCEAN, AND THE PAST ORBITAL ECCENTRICITY OF THESE MOONS, ALL OF WHICH AFFECT TIDALLY-DRIVEN GEOLOGIC ACTIVITY. HOWEVER, THESE MODELS HAVE NOT YET BEEN TESTED AGAINST THE OBSERVED GEOLOGIC RECORDS OF DIONE AND RHEA. THE FIRST OBJECTIVE OF OUR PROPOSED WORK IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE TECTONIC RECORDS OF DIONE AND RHEA INCLUDE FRACTURES CAUSED BY ECCENTRICITY TIDES.

TO COMPLETE THESE OBJECTIVES, OUR FIRST TASK WILL BE MAPPING FRACTURES ON DIONE AND RHEA AND MEASURING THEIR ORIENTATIONS USING CASSINI ISS IMAGES. THEN, AS OUR SECOND TASK, WE WILL COMPUTE TIDAL STRESSES IN RHEOLOGICALLYLAYERED BODIES FOR A VARIETY OF ORBITAL-INTERIOR MODELS, INFORMED BY FORMATION MODELS. WE WILL INCLUDE INTERIOR STRUCTURES WITH AND WITHOUT OCEANS TO TEST THE INFERENCE OF OCEANS ON DIONE AND RHEA FROM CRATER RELAXATION AND FLEXURE MODELS AND TO CONSTRAIN THE EXTENT OF TIDAL ACTIVITY THAT CAN BE EXPECTED IN OCEAN-FREE SATELLITES. WE WILL ALSO TEST THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER ECCENTRICITIES IN ORDER TO CONSTRAIN ORBITAL EVOLUTION MODELS OF THE SATURNIAN SYSTEM THAT INVOKE SUCH SCENARIOS. OUR THIRD TASK WILL BE A STATISTICAL COMPARISON BETWEEN THE FRACTURE PATTERNS PREDICTED BY OUR TIDAL MODELS AND THE OBSERVED TECTONIC RECORDS OF DIONE AND RHEA. WE WILL USE THE OBSERVED FRACTURE ORIENTATIONS, GLOBAL PATTERN OF FRACTURING, AND TIDAL STRESS MAGNITUDES TO IDENTIFY THE MOST LIKELY ORBITAL-INTERIOR MODEL(S) FOR EACH MOON. FINALLY, WE WILL COMPARE RESULTS FOR BOTH MOONS, AS WELL AS PUBLISHED MODELS OF ENCELADUS AND MIMAS, TO DETERMINE THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE(S) OF THEIR VARYING SURFACE HISTORIES. THE POWER OF THE TIDAL-TECTONIC MODELING APPROACH, DEVELOPED BY OUR PROPOSAL TEAM, HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED AT EUROPA FOR SEVERAL TYPES OF TECTONIC FEATURES. IN RECENT YEARS, OUR TEAM HAS ADAPTED THESE METHODS TO ADDRESS VISCOELASTIC RHEOLOGIES AND VALIDATED OUR NUMERICAL TOOLS AGAINST RESULTS PUBLISHED FOR EUROPA. WE HAVE SINCE USED THESE TOOLS TO CONDUCT TIDAL-TECTONIC ANALYSES OF PLUTOS MOON, CHARON, AND SATURNS MOON, MIMAS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR PROPOSED WORK RELIES ON THESE PUBLISHED AND VALIDATED METHODS. OUR PROPOSED WORK WILL CHARACTERIZE THE TECTONIC ACTIVITY OF SATURNS MID-SIZED ICY MOONS, CONSTRAIN THE RHEOLOGY AND ORBITAL HISTORIES OF DIONE AND RHEA, AND ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF PAST LIQUID WATER OCEANS WITHIN THESE MOONS.

THEREFORE A THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (TMS) MUST BE DEVELOPED TO MAINTAIN THE SPACECRAFT''S TEMPERATURE AT AN OPERABLE LEVEL THROUGHOUT THE MISSION. ONE FUNCTION OF THE TMS IS TO REGULATE THE SPACECRAFT''S RADIATIVE HEAT TRANSFER WITH THE ENVIRONMENT. PASSIVE RADIATION COATINGS ARE A DESIRABLE WAY TO ACHIEVE THIS SINCE THEY REQUIRE NO ELECTRICAL INPUT AND TYPICALLY ADD A NEGLIGIBLE AMOUNT OF MASS. THIS PROPOSAL DISCUSSES WAVELENGTH-SELECTIVE, TEMPERATURE-MODULATED MULTILAYER COATINGS WHICH CAN BE USED TO CONTROL THE RADIATIVE HEAT TRANSFER BETWEEN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE SPACECRAFT. IF THE SPACECRAFT''S TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH, THE RADIATION COATING CAN HELP TO REDUCE THE TEMPERATURE THROUGH ENHANCED THERMAL EMISSION BY SELECTIVELY EMITTING IN THE MID-INFRARED. CONVERSELY, IF THE SPACECRAFT TEMPERATURE IS TOO LOW, A HIGHLY REFLECTIVE RADIATION COATING CAN PREVENT FURTHER TEMPERATURE DECREASE BY MINIMIZING THERMAL LOSS. THE PROPOSED COATINGS WILL COMBINE BOTH FUNCTIONALITIES TO PROVIDE TEMPERATURE-MODULATED VARIABLE EMISSIVITY AND IMPROVED THERMAL CONTROL.

IN THE CASE OF EUROPA, MUCH OF THE CURRENT ENTHUSIASM FOR ITS HABITABILITY STEMS FROM THE LIKELIHOOD OF HYDROTHERMAL PROCESSING OF ICES AND ORGANIC COMPOUNDS EITHER IN THE PAST OR CONTINUING ON TO THE PRESENT. IN ADDITION, SINCE THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENTS WILL GENERATE FUNDAMENTAL DATA CONCERNING MECHANISMS, REACTION PRODUCTS, AND RATES, THEY WILL HELP TO CONSTRAIN NEW MODEL CALCULATIONS APPLIED TO THE INTERIOR EVOLUTION OF ICY WORLDS. ALTHOUGH NOT THE MAIN TARGETS, THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL PERMIT SIMILAR MODELS OF EARLY MARS, AND PLAUSIBLE CONDITIONS ON HABITABLE EXOPLANETS OR THEIR MOONS AS OBSERVATIONAL DATA IMPROVE."

HOW DOES THIS 1D ATMOSPHERE ASSUMPTION BIAS OUR INTERPRETATION OF EXOPLANET SPECTRA? DO WE HAVE TO CONSIDER GLOBAL TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS SUCH AS DAY-NIGHT CONTRASTS OR HOT SPOTS? WHAT ABOUT SPATIALLY INHOMOGENEOUS MOLECULAR ABUNDANCES AND CLOUDS? HOW WILL THIS CHANGE OUR INTERPRETATIONS OF PHASE RESOLVED SPECTRA? 3. CLOUDS/HAZES: UNDERSTANDING HOW CLOUDS/HAZES IMPACT TRANSIT SPECTRA IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL IF WE ARE TO OBTAIN PROPER ESTIMATES OF BASIC ATMOSPHERIC QUANTITIES.

EXCUSES AND EXPLANATIONS MAY IN TURN TRIGGER REPLANNING, WHICH WOULD INVOKE THE PLAN GENERATION PROCESS. ADDITIONALLY, THE REPLANNING PROCESS MUST BE AWARE OF THE PREVIOUSLY MADE COMMITMENTS (E.G., A PREVIOUS GOAL MAY BE HALF ACHIEVED),AND BE ABLE TO GENERATE A DIVERSE SET OF PLANS TO ACCOMMODATE THE PARTIALLY KNOWN HUMAN PREFERENCES. THE TECHNICAL OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND EVALUATE A DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT THAT SUPPORTS THE ABOVE ACTIVITIES. THE GOAL OF SUCH SYSTEM IS TO FACILITATE A NATURAL HUMAN-MACHINE INTERACTION, WHICH IS ALSO DESIRABLE IN A VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS. THE PROPOSED SYSTEMS, TERMED READS (RECOMMEND EXPLICABLE PLANS THAT ARE EASILY INTERPRETABLE, EXPLAIN PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS VIA EXCUSE AND EXPLANATION GENERATION, ACCOMMODATE COMMITMENTS AND HUMAN PREFERENCES FOR DECISION SUPPORT), REPRESENTS A CRITICAL CAPABILITY THAT IS REQUIRED IN SUCH SYSTEMS."

THE SUCCESS OF THE PROJECT RELIES ON CAREFUL ANALYSIS AND COMBINATION OF INSAR, GPS AND GRACE DATA SETS. TO THIS END THE FOLLOWING GOALS ARE ENVISIONED: 1. GENERATING MAP OF LARGE SCALE (#tilde#1000 KM), HIGH RESOLUTION (#tilde#500 M) AND TIME-DEPENDENT (2003 - 2018) 3D SURFACE DEFORMATION BY COMBINING ALL AVAILABLE GPS DATA AND LARGE SETS OF SAR IMAGES ACQUIRED BY ENVISAT, ALOS 1&2, SENTINEL-1, TERRASAR-X, COSMO- SKYMED SATELLITES. 2. APPLYING A BAYESIAN TIME-DEPENDENT MODELING SCHEME TO INVERT GRAVITY AND DEFORMATION DATA AND TO CONSTRAIN THE LOCAL POROELASTIC AQUIFER DEFORMATION CAUSED BY PUMPING AND TWS VARIATIONS LINKED TO REGIONAL ELASTIC LOADING, AT 1000 M RESOLUTION. 3. APPLYING A STATISTICAL FRAMEWORK TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL DATA ERRORS AND MODEL UNCERTAINTIES TO ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH OBTAINED TWS VARIATIONS, SUITABLE FOR DROUGHT FORECAST MODELS. 4. IMPLEMENTING A KALMAN FILTER FRAMEWORK TO FILL GAPS IN GRACE DATA AVAILABILITY, TO ASSURE THE CONTINUITY OF TWS ESTIMATES UNTIL GRACE-FO IS IN ORBIT. AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF THE SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATIONS OF TWS CAN BE USED TO ASSESS THE RECHARGE, WITHDRAWAL AND FLUXES OF WATER THROUGH THE HYDROLOGICAL WATER CYCLE. IT ACCOUNTS FOR VARIATIONS IN WATER AMONG ALL STORAGES, THUS, IT ALLOWS QUANTIFYING THE TOTAL CHANGE IN AVAILABILITY OF WATER FOR A REGION, AND THEREWITH, ESTIMATING SEVERITY OF AN UPCOMING DROUGHT. STATES ACROSS SOUTHWEST USA, IN PARTICULAR CALIFORNIA, ARE CURRENTLY UNDERGOING A SEVERE DROUGHT ON LARGE SPATIAL EXTENTS, WHICH CAUSES SHRINKAGE OF THE SURFACE AND GROUNDWATER RESOURCES. THUS, A COMPREHENSIVE MONITORING AND MODELING SCHEMES TO ENHANCE DROUGHT MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATING THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS AT VARIOUS SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES IS AN ESSENTIAL. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH EFFORT WILL PERFORM A JOINT ANALYSIS OF THE DEFORMATION AND GRAVITY DATA TO OBTAIN MAPS OF TWS VARIATIONS, ON VARIOUS SCALES RANGING FROM 100S OF M TO 1000S OF KM. TO THIS END WE WILL ANALYZE THE ARCHIVE OF GRAVITY DATA OBTAINED BY GRACE SATELLITES (2002-PRESENT) AND THE HIGH RESOLUTION 3D DEFORMATION DATA OBTAINED THROUGH INSAR PROCESSING OF THE SAR IMAGES ACQUIRED BY VARIOUS SATELLITES (2003-PRESENT) AND GPS MEASUREMENTS OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. COMBINATION OF THE HIGH RESOLUTION DEFORMATION DATA AND CONTINUOUS GRAVITY OBSERVATIONS, THROUGH A BAYESIAN INVERSE MODELING SCHEME, PROVIDES MULTISCALE ESTIMATES OF WATER STORAGES VARIATIONS AND ITS UNCERTAINTY. THUS IT PROVIDES UNIQUE CONSTRAINTS ON THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF HYDROLOGICAL MASS FLUXES, USEFUL FOR PROBABILISTIC DROUGHT FORECAST AND MANAGEMENT. RESULTS FROM THIS PROJECT WILL ASSESS THE CAPABILITIES OF INSAR IN COMBINATION WITH GRACE AND GPS DATA TO PROVIDE HIGH RESOLUTION SPATIOTEMPORAL OBSERVATIONS OF TWS VARIATIONS. A BYPRODUCT OF THIS PROJECT IS THE LARGE SCALE MAP OF SURFACE DEFORMATION ACROSS CALIFORNIA, WHICH IS USEFUL FOR VARIOUS ENGINEERING AND SCIENTIFIC APPLICATION. THUS BROAD LONG TERM BENEFITS ARE EXPECTED. THROUGH OUTREACH PROGRAMS, WE WILL MENTOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, IN PARTICULAR, FEMALES AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES TO ENCOURAGE THEM PURSUE A CAREER IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING. THIS PROJECT PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR TWO PH.D. STUDENTS FOR TWO YEARS AND PARTIAL SUPPORTS FOR 3 EARLY CAREER SCIENTISTS. IT WILL ALSO ALLOW DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGY-BASED AND LEARNER-CENTERED CURRICULA FOR UNDERGRADUATE COURSES. ALL TOOLS DEVELOPED AND RESULTS OBTAINED HEREIN WILL BE DOCUMENTED AND AVAILABLE TO THE ENGINEERING AND EARTHSCIENCE COMMUNITIES AS OPEN SOURCE."

ONE MINERAL SYSTEM THAT RECORDS A RANGE OF PRE- AND POST-ACCRETIONARY HISTORIES ARE THE FE-SULFIDES. THEY OCCUR IN A WIDE RANGE OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL MATERIALS AND ARE ATTRIBUTED TO FORMING THROUGH A RANGE OF PROCESSES IN THE EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM. SUCH PROCESSES INCLUDE CONDENSATION, CRYSTALLIZATION/EXSOLUTION, GAS-SOLID/LIQUID REACTION, THERMAL METAMORPHISM, AND AQUEOUS-PHASE PROCESSING. PREVIOUS WORK ON HAYABUSA SAMPLES (ASTEROID 25143 ITOKAWA) IMPLIES THEIR SULFIDES FORMED BY THERMAL METAMORPHISM (BEING LL5-6 MATERIAL).THE COMPOSITIONS, MORPHOLOGIES, AND CRYSTAL STRUCTURES OF SULFIDES ARE DETERMINED BY THEIR FORMATION CONDITIONS INCLUDING TEMPERATURE, TIME, OXYGEN AND SULFUR FUGACITY, AND AQUEOUS AND THERMAL HISTORY. WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE STRUCTURES, COMPOSITIONS, AND CONTEXT OF SULFIDE MINERALS IN SAMPLES RETURNED BY HAYABUSA AND COMPARE THESE WITH SULFIDES IN CHONDRITIC METEORITES. WE WILL CONSTRAIN PARENT BODY FORMATION CONDITIONS OF ASTEROID ITOKAWA BY STUDYING ANALOGOUS SULFIDES WITH PETROGRAPHIC CONTEXT IN CHONDRITIC METEORITES. WE WILL ALSO DEVELOP A SULFIDE DATABASE TO INTERPRET CONDITIONS OF FORMATION FOR SULFIDES THAT WILL LIKELY BE FOUND IN SAMPLES RETURNED BY HAYABUSA2 AND OSIRIS-REX.WE WILL IDENTIFY CANDIDATE SULFIDE GRAINS IN CHONDRITIC METEORITES VIA SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (SEM) AND ELECTRON PROBE MICROANALYSIS (EPMA), DETERMINE GRAIN ORIENTATION VIA ELECTRON BACKSCATTER DIFFRACTION (EBSD), AND EXTRACT REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES VIA FOCUSED-ION-BEAM (FIB) TECHNIQUES. WE WILL STUDY THE COMPOSITION, TEXTURE, AND CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF INDIVIDUAL FIB SECTIONS OF THE SULFIDES VIA TRANSMISSION-ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (TEM) TO INVESTIGATE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN FORMATION MECHANISM, OXYGEN AND SULFUR FUGACITY, TEMPERATURE, AND COOLING RATE. WE WILL CONDUCT THE SAME MEASUREMENTS ON ALLOCATED SULFIDE-BEARING HAYABUSA SAMPLES. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SULFIDES (PYRRHOTITE ((FE,NI,CO,CR)1-XS) AND PENTLANDITE ((FE,NI,CO,CR)9-XS8)) IN LL, CI, CM, AND CR CHONDRITES THAT RECORD EQUILIBRATION TEMPERATURES FROM 100 TO 600DEGREES C. STUDYING SULFIDES IN METEORITES THAT RETAIN THEIR PETROGRAPHIC CONTEXT ALLOWS COMPARISONS BETWEEN ESTABLISHED GEOTHERMOMETERS AND THERMODYNAMIC VARIABLES. SINCE PYRRHOTITE-PENTLANDITE INTERGROWTHS ARE UNCOMMON IN SOME METEORITE GROUPS, SULFIDES IN SMALL RETURNED SAMPLES MAY ONLY CONSIST OF PYRRHOTITE OR PENTLANDITE. THEREFORE, TO UNDERSTAND SULFIDE FORMATION IN ASTEROIDS IT IS IMPORTANT TO STUDY SULFIDES IN METEORITES WITH WELL-KNOWN FORMATION CONDITIONS TO INVESTIGATE INDICATORS OF FORMATION IN BOTH PYRRHOTITE AND PENTLANDITE. PETROGRAPHIC, CHEMICAL, AND THERMODYNAMIC ANALYSES ON SULFIDES IN METEORITES VIA SEM, EPMA, EBSD, AND FIB-TEM WILL PROVIDE A DIVERSE SAMPLE SET OF SULFIDES FOR COMPOSITIONAL AND MICROSTRUCTURAL INVESTIGATIONS TO COMPARE WITH RETURNED SAMPLES. THE MOTIVATION FOR THIS RESEARCH IS TO IDENTIFY MICROSTRUCTURAL INDICATORS OF SULFIDE FORMATION CONDITIONS SO THAT PRE- AND/OR POST-ACCRETIONARY FORMATION CONDITIONS CAN BE DETERMINED FOR SAMPLES THAT CONTAIN SULFIDES BUT LACK PETROGRAPHIC CONTEXT, AS MAY BE THE CASE FOR RETURNED SAMPLES.THIS RESEARCH IS RELEVANT TO THE SCOPE OF THE LABORATORY ANALYSIS OF RETURNED SAMPLES (LARS) PROGRAM, BECAUSE IT AIMS TO ''MAXIMIZE THE SCIENCE DERIVED FROM PLANETARY SAMPLE-RETURN MISSIONS''. LARS IS MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THIS RESEARCH SINCE IT IS RELEVANT TO THE SCOPE OF LARS IN C.18: ''DIRECT ANALYSIS OF SAMPLES ALREADY RETURNED TO EARTH''. THE ANALYSES OF METEORITES ARE APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THEY WILL DIRECTLY SUPPORT THE INTERPRETATION OF RETURNED SAMPLES (SPECIFIED IN 1.3.3, C.18). WE WILL ANALYZE HAYABUSA SAMPLES ALREADY ALLOCATED AND DEVELOP A TIMELY DATABASE OF CHONDRITIC SULFIDES TO ASSIST IN THE INTERPRETATION OF SULFIDES IN RETURNED-SAMPLES OF ASTEROID RYUGU BY HAYABUSA2 IN 2020."

THE PRELIMINARY STUDIES SHOW THAT  NANOPRECIPITATES ARE THE HOSTS FOR MANY OF THE TRACEELEMENTS IN THE METEORITES, AND REVEALING THEIR DISTRIBUTION IS IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING THE FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM MATERIALS. THIS STUDY WILL ALSO BE EXTENDED TO METALS IN BENCUBBINITES (CB CHONDRITES), WHICH ARE PRIMITIVE, METAL-RICH BRECCIAS CLOSELY RELATED TO CR AND CH CHONDRITES. THE DISPARATE ORIGINS AND THERMAL HISTORIES OF THE METAL FROM IRON METEORITES AND BENCUBBINITES WILL PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION ON NANOPRECIPITATE FORMATION AND COMPOSITION.INTRODUCTION: TRACE ELEMENTS IN IRON METEORITES ARE USED TO MODEL CRYSTALLIZATION PROCESSES THAT OCCURED WITHIN ASTEROIDAL CORES AND TO HELP ELUCIDATE THE FORMATION AND THERMAL HISTORY OF METAL DURING NEBULAR AND PLANETARY DIFFERENTIATION PROCESSES. WHILE TRACE ELEMENTS ARE DETERMINED BY A NUMBER OF ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES SUCH AS SIMS AND LASER ABLATION ICPMS, THESE METHODS PROVIDE LITTLE DATA ON THE TRACE-ELEMENT HOSTS. STUDIES OF STEELS AND ALLOYS REVEAL THAT MINOR AND TRACE ELEMENTS OFTEN CONCENTRATE IN NANOPRECIPITATES, AND THERE HAS BEEN EXTENSIVE STUDY OF THEIR FORMATION. THEIR CHEMISTRY, MORPHOLOGY, AND DISTRIBUTION PROVIDES KEY INFORMATION ON A SAMPLES THERMAL HISTORY. FURTHER, THE ROLE OF TRACE ELEMENTS IN ALLOY FORMATION, SOLIDIFICATION, AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES IS WELL DOCUMENTED. IN CONTRAST, THERE ARE VIRTUALLY NO STUDIES OF NON-METAL AND PGE-RICH NANOPRECIPITATES IN IRON METEORITES.PRELIMINARY WORK: I INITIATED A PRELIMINARY TEM-EDS-EELS STUDY AND FOUND ABUNDANT NANOPRECIPITATES OF UNUSUAL COMPOSITIONS IN A RANGE OF IRONS AND A STONY-IRON METEORITE: ODESSA (IAB-MG), BUTLER (UNGROUPED), GIBEON (IVA), CANYON DIABLO (IAB-MG), DEEP SPRINGS (UNGROUPED), BRENHAM (PMG-AN), HENBURY (IIIAB), AND GRESSK (IIAB). NANOPRECIPITATES WERE EXTRACTED BY CUTTING A FRESH SURFACE FOLLOWED BY ETCHING WITH EITHER HNO3/METHANOL OR LIQUID BROMINE. THIS SURFACE WAS THEN COATED WITH A THIN LAYER OF C, WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FLOATED OFF THE METEORITE BY PLACING THE SAMPLE BACK IN THE ETCHANT. THE ADHERING NANOPRECIPITATES WERE THEN STUDIED BY TEM-EDS-EELS. A WIDE RANGE OF NANOPARTICLES WAS DISCOVERED, E.G., PD-BEARING ALLOYS, PGE NUGGETS, GE- AND GA- RICH NI PHOSPHIDES, CR-MO NITRIDES, AND CR SULFIDES WITH PGES. COMPOSITE NANOPRECIPITATES WERE ALSO FOUND IN CANYON DIABLO AND ODESSA, INCLUDING CR-MO NITRIDES WITH ADHERING CAPS OF PD-SN OR FE-NI-P PARTICLES. THESE COMPOSITE NANOPRECIPITATES PROVIDE INFORMATION ON PRECIPITATION SEQUENCE.PROPOSED RESEARCH: NANOPARTICLES WILL BE EXTRACTED AND CHARACTERIZED BY TEM AND ELECTRON-BEAM TECHNIQUES. GIVEN THE CHALLENGES OF QUANTIFYING HEAVY ELEMENTS BY EDS AND EELS, I WILL ALSO USE THE MICRO-PIXE AT ASU FOR THEIR ELEMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION. THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE NANOSCALE PHASE PETROLOGY OF METAL SYSTEMS, WHICH HAS AN IMPORTANT BEARING ON TRACE ELEMENT BEHAVIOR AND IN SOME CASES, LARGER SCALE STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF METAL-RICH METEORITES.PROGRAMMATIC CONSIDERATIONS: THE PROPOSED STUDY IS DESIGNED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOLID-STATE HISTORIES OF METEORITES, THEIR FORMATION, AND ACCRETION. BY ADDRESSING PROBLEMS RELATED TO PROCESSES THAT OCCURRED IN THE EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM, WE WILL PROVIDE FUNDAMENTAL NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE ORIGIN OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM AND ITS SOLID BODIES. AS SUCH THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ENCOMPASSES THE SCOPE OF THE EMERGING WORLDS PROGRAM DESIGNED TO ... ANSWER THE FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE QUESTION OF HOW THE SOLAR SYSTEM FORMED AND EVOLVED ... AND ... CONDUCT SCIENTIFIC INVENSTIGATIONS RELATED TO UNDERSTANDING THE FORMATION AND EARLY EVOLUTION OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM."

THE POTENTIAL OF A SEISMOMETER TO IDENTIFY LIQUID WATER THAT WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO A LANDER WILL, IN FACT, BE CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING THE GOAL OF NASA S OCEAN WORLDS AND OUTER PLANETS PROGRAM: TO ENABLE IDENTIFICATION OF EXTANT LIFE ON ANOTHER WORLD. HOWEVER, UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE SURFACE OF EUROPA PRESENT PARTICULAR CHALLENGES TO A SEISMIC INSTRUMENT DEPLOYMENT, WHICH MAY AFFECT THE PENETRATION DEPTH AND INSTALLATION ANGLE AND STABILITY OF A SEISMIC SENSOR. FURTHERMORE, UNKNOWN TRADE-OFFS EXIST BETWEEN PURSUING SEISMOLOGICAL GOALS WITH A SINGLE SEISMOMETER VERSUS A LOCALIZED ARRAY OF SEISMIC SENSORS. FINALLY, EUROPA S RADIATION AND EXTREMELY LOW-TEMPERATURE ENVIRONMENT IS SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE MOON, OR MARS, WHERE SEISMIC EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN PLANNED AND/OR CARRIED OUT. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO MATURE A MINIATURE BROADBAND SEISMOMETER FOR DEPLOYMENT ON EUROPA TO PROBE THE PROPERTIES OF ITS ICE SHELL AND INTERIOR STRUCTURE AND RECORD CURRENT ACTIVITY. RECENT ADVANCES IN MICROELECTROMECHANICAL SYSTEM (MEMS) HAVE ENABLED OPTIMIZATION OF SEISMOMETERS FOR SPACEFLIGHT SEISMIC INSTRUMENTATION. FOR EXAMPLE, A SEISMOMETER PACKAGE IS THE PRIMARY INSTRUMENT OF THE INSIGHT MISSION AND CONSISTS OF A 3-AXIS VERYBROADBAND INSTRUMENT, WHICH IS A TRADITIONAL PENDULUM SYSTEM, AND A 3-AXIS SHORT PERIOD MEMS SEISMOMETER, BUILT WITH SILICON-BASED MICROFABRICATION. HOWEVER, THIS PACKAGE HAS NOT YET ACHIEVED THE SIMULTANEOUS REQUIREMENTS FOR LOW MASS AND POWER, HIGH ROBUSTNESS, AND HIGH PERFORMANCE. ITS THEORETICAL NOISE FLOOR IS LIMITED IN SHORT PERIOD, AND THE VACUUM PACKAGING ISSUE HAS POSTPONED LAUNCH FOR AT LEAST FOR TWO YEARS. FURTHERMORE, ITS TOLERANCE ON SHOCK (2KG) AND INSTALLATION ANGLE ( 15 ) LIMITS ITS POTENTIAL USE IN OTHER MISSIONS, ESPECIALLY WITH UNKNOWN ICY SURFACE CONDITIONS ON EUROPA. WE PROPOSE TO MATURE A BROADBAND MINIATURE SEISMOMETER, WHICH USES A MEMS SENSING ELEMENT WITH IONIC LIQUID BASED ELECTROLYTE AS THE SENSING BODY. THIS DESIGN WILL SERVE AS THE BASIS OF A FLIGHT INSTRUMENT FOR A EUROPA LANDER MISSION, CURRENTLY UNDER STUDY. THIS NEW INSTRUMENT PROVIDES BOTH HIGH SENSITIVITY AND DYNAMIC RANGE, BROAD-BAND RESPONSE, AND HIGH ENVIRONMENT TOLERANCES, REACHING OR EXCEEDING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR EUROPA LANDER MISSION SUGGESTED FROM JPL EUROPA LANDER REPORT. IT ALSO HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF FLEXIBLE DEPLOYMENT METHODS DUE TO ITS HIGH SHOCK TOLERANCE (>25 KG),  180  TILT TOLERANCE, AND NO REQUIREMENT OF VACUUM SEALING. WE WILL ACHIEVE THIS GOAL THROUGH THREE OBJECTIVES: 1) MATURATION OF MINIATURE SEISMOMETER TECHNOLOGY FOR USE IN EUROPA S ENVIRONMENT, 2) DETERMINE OPTIMAL SENSOR DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION THROUGH FIELD TESTING WITH EXISTING SEISMOMETERS, 3) MODEL THE EXPECTED SEISMICITY OF EUROPA AND THE CORRESPONDING INSTRUMENT CAPABILITIES AND REQUIREMENTS TO ACHIEVE LANDER MISSION OBJECTIVES. OUR PROPOSED WORK IS RELEVANT TO THE COLDTECH PROGRAM, AS IT WOULD BRING SEISMIC SENSOR CELL, THE CORE MECHANICAL HARDWARE OF A SEISMOMETER INSTRUMENT, TO TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVEL 6 (TRL 6) FOR THE POTENTIAL EUROPA LANDER MISSION. THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES WOULD  DEVELOP AND ADVANCE THE MATURITY OF SCIENCE INSTRUMENTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE FOCUSED ON THE DETECTION OF EVIDENCE OF LIFE, ESPECIALLY EXTANT LIFE, IN THE OCEAN WORLDS OF THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM  AND PROVIDE  SPACECRAFT TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRED TO ACCESS THE OCEANS. . THE SEISMOMETER WE ARE DEVELOPING WILL BE CAPABLE OF IDENTIFYING AND PHYSICALLY CHARACTERIZING THE MOST LIKELY HABITATS ON EUROPA. ITS UNIQUE ROBUSTNESS AND FLEXIBILITY WILL MITIGATE RISK FOR THE EUROPA LANDER MISSION AND PROVIDE A NEW TOOL FOR FUTURE EXPLORATION OF OTHER OCEAN WORLDS."

SOURCE DATA WOULD BE THE EXISTING RAW MASTCAM EDRS ARCHIVED IN THE PDS GEOSCIENCES NODE, AND OUTPUTS WOULD BE ROBUSTLY CALIBRATED AND VALIDATED RDRS THAT PROVIDE ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF RADIANCE AND RADIANCE FACTOR IN EACH MASTCAM FILTER.OUR TEAM HAS SUBSTANTIAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE PREVIOUS CREATION AND ARCHIVING OF I/F DATA SETS FROM MPF AND MER, AND WITH THE MODELING WORK NEEDED TO PROPERLY CALIBRATE THE MASTCAM DATA SETS. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE ACQUISITION OF THE MASTCAM IMAGES AND THEIR TAC-TICAL CALIBRATION, AND SO ARE INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH THE STARTING DATA SET FOR THIS PROJECT. WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE PROJECT WITH THE GEOSCIENCES NODE AND THEY HAVE AGREED TO ARCHIVE THE DATA SET."""

TESTING WITH THE HSI HAS BEEN CONDUCTED PREVIOUSLY DURING NASAS FIRST FUNDAMENTAL ICE CRYSTAL ICING TEST. DURING THAT TEST, THE HSI DEMONSTRATED CAPABILITY TO NON- ?INTRUSIVELY MEASURE THE PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION IN CHALLENGING CONDITIONS. THIS CAPABILITY IS ESSENTIAL TO MEASURING THE PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION WITHIN AN OPERATING ENGINE EXPOSED ICI CONDITIONS. NASA RESEARCHERS ARE PROPOSING THAT ARTIUM TECHNOLOGIES PROVIDE PARTICLE SIZE MEASUREMENT SERVICES DURING THE HONEYWELL ENGINE TEST, WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR JUNE 2017. THE NASA ICI RESEARCH TEAM PROPOSES THAT PARTICLE SIZE MEASUREMENTS BE TAKEN SIMULTANEOUSLY UPSTREAM OF THE FAN AND IN THE BY- ?PASS FLOW WITH THE HONEYWELL ENGINE DURING PORTIONS OF THE TESTING. ARTIUM SHALL WORK WITH NASA AND HONEYWELL PERSONNEL PRIOR TO THE SCHEDULE START DATE TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF THE HSI INSTRUMENTS DURING TESTING.

IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE PROPOSE TO USE ADVANCES IN COMPUTING POWER AND MODEL DEVELOPMENT TO EMPLOY NESTED SYNOPTIC-TO-MESOSCALE MODELING OF CLOUD SYSTEMS AND MOIST CONVECTION USING MASSIVELY PARALLEL COMPUTING. CRUCIALLY, WE PROPOSE TO FOCUS THE EFFORT ON WELL DOCUMENTED \GREAT WHITE SPOT\"" (GWS) CONVECTIVE CLOUD SYSTEMS ON SATURN. NOT ONLY IS THE MORPHOLOGICAL EVOLUTION OF THESE STORMS WELL OBSERVED USING IMAGING, BUT THERMAL AND TRACE PROCESS DATA EXIST FROM THERMAL OBSERVATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, PARA/ORTHO HYDROGEN OBSERVATIONS PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT CONSTRAINTS ON THE DISTRIBUTION AND VIGOR OF MOIST CONVECTION. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO UNDERSTAND THE PHYSICAL PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH CONVECTIVE STORMS AND THE DYNAMICAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN STORMS AND THE LARGE-SCALE DYNAMICS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE MOIST CONVECTION SCHEME THAT CHARACTERIZES THE WATER AND AMMONIA CLOUD DYNAMICS ON SATURN AND JUPITER AND INVESTIGATE THE FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF CONVECTIVE STORMS AT VARIOUS SCALES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH A NUMERICAL SCHEME WITHIN GLOBAL MODELS IS A CRITICAL PREREQUISITE FOR MAKING FURTHER PROGRESS ON UNDERSTANDING THE GENERAL CIRCULATION OF THE GAS GIANT ATMOSPHERES. WE PROPOSE TO USE IMAGING AND INFRARED OBSERVATIONS FROM CASSINI IN COMBINATION WITH OUR PLANETWRF MODEL TO EXAMINE MOIST CONVECTION, AND SPECIFICALLY THE WELL DOCUMENTED GWS TEST CASE, ON CLOUD RESOLVING SCALES AND ALSO THEIR INTERACTION WITH LARGER-SCALE FLOWS. THE NESTED CLOUD-RESOLVING TO GLOBAL SCALE CAPABILITY OF PLANETWRF MAKES IT A UNIQUELY CAPABLE MODEL IN THIS APPLICATION. THE RESULTS FROM THE USE OF PLANETWRF TO SYNTHESIZE AND GENERALIZED OBSERVATIONS OF MOIST CONVECTION WILL BE USED TO FORMULATE SIMPLIFIED PLUME MODELS OF MOIST CONVECTION THAT CAN BE INCLUDED IN PURELY GLOBAL MODELS OF INSUFFICIENT RESOLUTION TO DIRECTLY CAPTURE THESE PROCESSES. THE GENERAL CIRCULATION OF GAS GIANT ATMOSPHERES IS A MAJOR SCIENCE FOCUS FOR NASA, BOTH IN TERMS OF THE GAS GIANTS IN OUR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM, BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF GAS GIANT DYNAMICS FOR UNDERSTANDING EXTRA-SOLAR PLANETS."""

THE CHAMBER WILL USE A TWO-PIECE GRCOP-84 LINER THAT IS INSERTED AND MP WELDED INTO A ONE-PIECE INCONEL 625 STRUCTURAL JACKET. THE MPW STEP WILL BE USED TO PERMANENTLY JOIN THE TWO HALVES OF THE LINER AT THE THROAT AND THE LINER ITSELF TO THE JACKET IN A STRUCTURALLY SOUND, WATERTIGHT MANNER. OUR STRUCTURAL JACKET DESIGN INCLUDES INTEGRAL PROPELLANT MANIFOLDS, WHICH ELIMINATES THE TIME AND EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH MACHINING OR CASTING SEPARATE COMPONENTS AND WELDING THEM IN PLACE. THE BENEFITS OF SUCH A DESIGN ARE SUBSTANTIAL. FIRST, IT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT FOR COMPLICATED COMPONENTS LIKE A MODERN COMBUSTION CHAMBER, AN AM MANUFACTURING APPROACH CAN DRASTICALLY REDUCE COST (BY 50% OR MORE) AND LEAD TIME (WEEKS INSTEAD OF MONTHS). SECOND, OUR PARTICULAR DESIGN OVERCOMES WEAKNESSES OF OTHER ADDITIVE DESIGNS BY ENABLING EASY INSPECTION OF THE PRINTED PARTS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE TO UNDERGO CT SCANNING OR X-RAY INSPECTION, WHICH HAS PROVEN TO BE EXCEPTIONALLY DIFFICULT FOR COMPLEX INTERNAL GEOMETRIES LIKE REGENERATIVE COOLING CHANNELS AND PROPELLANT MANIFOLDS. THIRD, OUR BASIC MATERIAL AND MANUFACTURING APPROACH IS SCALABLE TO BOOSTER CLASS COMBUSTION CHAMBERS AT A RATE CONTROLLED SOLELY BY SCALING OF THE BUILD VOLUMES AVAILABLE IN COMMERCIAL SLM MACHINES (WHICH IS OCCURRING RAPIDLY).

INDEED, THESE OBSERVATIONS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT DISKS EXHIBIT DIVERSE MORPHOLOGIES, INDICATING THAT DISKS EVOLVE ALONG A MIRIAD OF PATHWAYS. A KEY NEXT STEP IS TO COMPLEMENT THE INFRARED DATA BY OBTAINING RESOLVED SUBMILLIMETER IMAGES OF THE DISKS. RESOLVED IMAGES BREAK MANY OF THE DEGENERACIES INHERENT IN INTERPRETING UNRESOLVED SPECTRAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS AND ENABLES DETERMINATION OF THE DISK SURFACE DENSITY, WHICH IS THE PRIMARY DETERMINANT OF WHEN AND WHERE PLANETS MAY FORM IN DISKS.

FIRST, WE WILL DETERMINE IF THE PLANET FORMATION IS IN FULL PROGRESS AT AGES OF #tilde# 1 MYR BY IMAGING A CAREFULLY SELECTED SAMPLE OF NINE DISKS AT THE HIGHEST RESOLUTION AVAILABLE WITH ALMA. SECOND, WE WILL MEASURE HOW THE DISK SURFACE DENSITY EVOLVES OF 5-10 MYR TIMESCALES BY CONTRASTING THE DISK PROPERTIES AROUND STARS WITH VARYING AGES.

OUR ADAP PROGRAM TO MEASURE THE MASS LOSS FROM THE AGB AND RSG STARS IN THE MAGELLANIC CLOUDS IS NEARING COMPLETION, AND WE WISH TO EXTEND THIS SUCCESSFUL STUDY TO THE GALACTIC BULGE OF THE MILKY WAY GALAXY. METALLICITY SHOULD DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF ELEMENTS AVAILABLE TO CONDENSE DUST IN THE STAR''S OUTFLOW, SO EVOLVED STARS OF DIFFERING METALLICITIES SHOULD HAVE DIFFERING MASS-LOSS RATES. BUILDING UPON OUR WORK ON EVOLVED STARS IN THE MAGELLANIC CLOUDS, WE WILL COMPARE THE MASS-LOSS RATES FROM AGB AND RSG STARS IN THE OLDER AND POTENTIALLY MORE METAL-RICH BULGE TO THE MASS-LOSS RATES OF AGB AND RSG STARS IN THE MAGELLANIC CLOUDS, WHICH HAVE LOWER METALLICITY, MAKING FOR AN INTERESTING CONTRAST. IN ADDITION, THE GALACTIC BULGE, LIKE THE CLOUDS, IS LOCATED AT A WELLDETERMINED DISTANCE (#tilde#8 KPC), THEREBY REMOVING THE DISTANCE AMBIGUITIES THAT PRESENT A MAJOR UNCERTAINTY IN DETERMINING MASS-LOSS RATES AND LUMINOSITIES FOR EVOLVED STARS. TO MODEL PHOTOMETRIC OBSERVATIONS OF OUTFLOWING DUST SHELLS AROUND EVOLVED STARS, WE HAVE CONSTRUCTED THE GRID OF RED SUPERGIANT AND ASYMPTOTIC GIANT BRANCH MODELS (GRAMS; SARGENT ET AL 2011; SRINIVASAN ET AL 2011) USING THE RADIATIVE TRANSFER CODE 2DUST (UETA AND MEIXNER 2003). OUR STUDY WILL APPLY THESE MODELS TO THE LARGE PHOTOMETRIC DATABASE OF SOURCES IDENTIFIED IN THE SPITZER SPACE TELESCOPE GLIMPSE SURVEY OF THE MILKY WAY AND ALSO TO THE VARIOUS INFRARED SPECTRA OF BULGE AGB AND RSG STARS FROM SPITZER, ISO, ETC. WE HAVE ALREADY MODELED A FEW GALACTIC BULGE EVOLVED STARS WITH GRAMS, AND WE WILL USE THESE RESULTS AS THE FOUNDATION FOR MODELING A LARGE AND REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF GALACTIC BULGE EVOLVED STARS IDENTIFIED AND MEASURED PHOTOMETRICALLY BY GLIMPSE. WE WILL USE OUR GRAMS GRID, EXPANDING AS NECESSARY TO ENABLE MODELING OF THE HIGHER METALLICITY EVOLVED STARS OF THE GALACTIC BULGE, ALONG WITH MODELS OF OTHER TYPES OF STARS, SUCH AS YSOS (ROBITAILLE ET AL 2006), TO IDENTIFY THE EVOLVED STARS IN THE GLIMPSE SAMPLE OF THE GALACTIC BULGE. WE WILL USE THESE WELL-TESTED GRAMS MODELS, WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY EXTENSIVELY APPLIED TO STUDY POPULATIONS OF MASS LOSING EVOLVED STARS IN THE MAGELLANIC CLOUDS, TO FIT THE SPECTRAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS (SEDS; PLOTS OF EMITTED POWER VERSUS WAVELENGTH) OF GLIMPSE GALACTIC BULGE SOURCES IDENTIFIED AS RSG STARS AND OXYGEN-RICH (O-RICH), CARBON-RICH (C-RICH), AND EXTREME AGB STARS. THIS MODELING WILL YIELD STELLAR LUMINOSITIES AND MASS-LOSS RATES, AS WELL AS GENERAL DUST CHEMISTRY (O-RICH VERSUS C-RICH) AND OTHER ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DUST PRODUCED BY EVOLVED STARS IN THE GALACTIC PLANE.

IT WILL COMBINE ANALYSIS OF NASA HELIOPHYSICS SYSTEM OBSERVATORY DATA PRODUCTS, AND RELEVANT DATA-DRIVEN MODELS INTO AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM FOR THE CHARACTERIZATION OF CORONAL WAVES AND SHOCKS AND THE EVALUATION OF THEIR CAPABILITY TO ACCELERATE SEPS. CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS (CMES) ARE ONE OF THE MAIN PHENOMENA THAT MODIFY SPACE WEATHER IN THE HELIOSPHERE. AMONG OTHER EFFECTS, DURING THEIR HELIOSPHERIC PROPAGATION THEY ROUTINELY DRIVE COLLISIONLESS SHOCKS, WHICH IN TURN MAY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT FLUXES OF SOLAR ENERGETIC PARTICLES (SEPS). RECENT STUDIES HAVE USED EXTREME UV (EUV) OBSERVATIONS TO SHOW THE CONNECTION OF CORONAL EUV WAVES TO METRIC RADIO TYPE II BURSTS IN THE CORONAL PHASES OF CMES. THIS SIGNIFIES THAT CME-DRIVEN SHOCKS CAN EXIST LOW IN THE CORONA, AND MAY ALREADY ACCELERATE SEPS AT THEIR VERY INITIAL STAGES. CHARACTERIZING CORONAL SHOCKS HAS ONLY BECOME POSSIBLE THROUGH REMOTE MEASUREMENTS FROM INSTRUMENTS ON THE SOHO, STEREO, AND SDO SPACECRAFT. EUV IMAGING WITH THE ATMOSPHERIC IMAGING ASSEMBLY(AIA) INSTRUMENT ON SDO HAS PROVED PARTICULARLY USEFUL FOR DETECTING LARGE-SCALE SHORT-LIVED CORONAL BRIGHT FRONTS, WHICH, COMBINED WITH RADIO OBSERVATIONS, HOLDS GREAT PROMISE FOR EARLY CME-DRIVEN SHOCK CHARACTERIZATION CAPABILITY. THIS CHARACTERIZATION CAN FURTHER BE AUTOMATED, AND RELATED TO MODELS OF PARTICLE ACCELERATION TO PRODUCE ESTIMATES OF PARTICLE FLUXES EARLY IN EVENTS. THE CASHEW FRAMEWORK WILL BE EXTENSIVELY TESTED AND VALIDATED ON A REPRESENTATIVE LIST OF CORONAL BRIGHT FRONT EVENTS. SOME OF THE SPECIFIC SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED THROUGH ANALYSES OF THE PROPOSED DATA PRODUCTS ARE 1) TO WHAT ENERGIES CAN CORONAL SHOCKS ACCELERATE SOLAR ENERGETIC PARTICLES? 2) HOW DOES CORONAL SHOCK ACCELERATION EFFICIENCY VARY WITH TIME AND LOCATION? 3) WHAT REMOTE OBSERVABLES ARE RELEVANT FOR DETERMINATION OF SHOCK ACCELERATION EFFICIENCY? THE PRODUCTS OF THE PROPOSED WORK WILL ENABLE AND FACILITATE FUTURE STUDIES OF CORONAL SHOCK WAVE PROPERTIES, AS WELL AS THEIR INFLUENCE ON SEP PRODUCTION AND HELIOSPHERIC CONNECTIVITY.

IN KEPLER GO PROGRAMS, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED TO DATE 3 SN IA (OLLING ET AL. 2015), 2 SN IIP (GARNAVICH ET AL. 2016; TUCKER ET AL., SUBMITTED), AND 1 SN IIN/IA-CSM (GARNAVICH ET AL., IN PREP.).

WE WILL ALSO COORDINATE MULTI-COLOR PHOTOMETRY AND SPECTRA TO CLASSIFY DISCOVERED TRANSIENTS USING LICK, GEMINI, AND KECK. IN CAMPAIGN C5 AND C6, WE SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFIED 4 SNE WITH DECAM OBSERVATIONS, OF WHICH WE CLASSIFIED 2 WITH GEMINI SPECTRA AS SN IA. THESE DATA, COUPLED WITH HIGH PRECISION 30 MINUTE K2 DATA WILL HAVE ENORMOUS LEGACY VALUE.

AN IMPORTANT GOAL OF SOLAR PHYSICS IS THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS OF SOLAR ACTIVITY, AS A PROBLEM IN ITS OWN RIGHT AND FOR ITS IMPORTANCE IN DETERMINING SPACE WEATHER. SOME CLUES TO THE PUZZLE SHOULD ARISE FROM STUDYING THE PHYSICAL PROCESSES IN THE DEEP CONVECTION ZONE SINCE IT IS THE MOTIONS IN THIS REGION THAT ARE THOUGHT TO REGENERATE THE POLOIDAL MAGNETIC FIELD FROM THE TOROIDAL MAGNETIC FIELD, AN ESSENTIAL PROCESS THAT ALLOWS THE SOLAR CYCLE TO CONTINUE. WHILE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED IN UNDERSTANDING SOLAR CONVECTION-ZONE DYNAMICS AND ITS RELATION TO SURFACE ACTIVITY, SOME IMPORTANT PROBLEMS STILL REMAIN, SUCH AS THE NATURE OF THE DEEP MERIDIONAL FLOW THAT DRIVES THE DYNAMO. RECENT MEASUREMENTS OF EQUATORWARD COMPONENT OF THE MERIDIONAL FLOW FROM HMI AND GONG DATA SHOW SIMILAR PATTERN OF GENERAL PICTURE OF THE FLOW PROFILE. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SOME CONTROVERSIAL RESULTS AS WELL. FOR EXAMPLE MULTI-CELL STRUCTURE OF THE MERIDIONAL FLOW (IN DEPTH AND LATITUDE) IS DIFFERENT IN TWO INDEPENDENT MEASUREMENTS. MOST OF THE DISAGREEMENTS MAY BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THESE MEASUREMENTS ARE NOT FROM STANDARD HMI OR GONG DATA PRODUCT. THEY ARE DERIVED USING DIFFERENT PROCESSING AND MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES. STANDARD PIPELINES DOES NOT PRODUCE SUCH TYPE OF DATA. MOREOVER, DEEP FLOW MEASUREMENTS ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO ANALYSIS METHODS AND PARAMETERS OF DATA PROCESSING E.G. PROJECTION, FILTERING ETC.

THE OST, A MID- TO FAR- INFRARED OBSERVATORY CONCEPT, IS BEING DEVELOPED AS A MAJOR NASA MISSION TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE NEXT DECADAL SURVEY WITH SUPPORT FROM NASA HEADQUARTERS. THE OBJECTIVE OF SUCH A FACILITY IS TO ALLOW RAPID SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEYS OF THE HIGH REDSHIFT UNIVERSE AT 420-800  M, USING ARRAYS OF INTEGRATED SPECTROMETERS WITH MODERATE RESOLUTIONS (R= #tilde#1000), TO CREATE A POWERFUL NEW DATA SET FOR EXPLORING GALAXY EVOLUTION AND THE GROWTH OF STRUCTURE IN THE UNIVERSE.

THESE OST SCIENCE OBJECTIVES ARE VERY EXCITING AND REPRESENT A WELL-ORGANIZED COMMUNITY AGREEMENT. HOWEVER, THEY ARE ALL IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH WITHOUT NEW DETECTOR TECHNOLOGY, AND THE OST CAN T BE RECOMMENDED OR APPROVED IF SUITABLE DETECTORS DO NOT EXIST. IN ALL OF THE ABOVE INSTRUMENT CONCEPTS, PHOTON-COUNTING DIRECT DETECTORS ARE MISSIONENABLING AND ESSENTIAL FOR REACHING THE SENSITIVITY PERMITTED BY THE CRYOGENIC ORIGINS SPACE TELESCOPE AND THE PERFORMANCE REQUIRED FOR ITS IMPORTANT SCIENCE PROGRAMS. OUR GROUP HAS DEVELOPED AN INNOVATIVE DESIGN FOR AN OPTICALLY-COUPLED KID THAT CAN REACH THE PHOTON-COUNTING SENSITIVITY REQUIRED BY THE AMBITIOUS SCIENCE GOALS OF THE OST MISSION. A KID IS A PLANAR MICROWAVE RESONATOR PATTERNED FROM A SUPERCONDUCTING THIN FILM, WHICH RESPONDS TO INCIDENT PHOTONS WITH A CHANGE IN ITS RESONANCE FREQUENCY AND DISSIPATION. THIS DETECTOR RESPONSE IS INTRINSICALLY FREQUENCY MULTIPLEXED, AND CONSEQUENTLY KIDS AT DIFFERENT RESONANCE FREQUENCIES CAN BE READ OUT USING STANDARD DIGITAL RADIO TECHNIQUES, WHICH ENABLES MULTIPLEXING OF #tilde#10,000S OF DETECTORS. IN OUR PHOTON-COUNTING KID DESIGN WE EMPLOY A SMALL-VOLUME (AND THIN) SUPERCONDUCTING AL INDUCTOR TO ENHANCE THE PER-PHOTON RESPONSIVITY, AND LARGE PARALLEL-PLATE NBTIN CAPACITORS ON SINGLE-CRYSTAL SILICON-ON-INSULATOR (SOI) SUBSTRATES TO ELIMINATE FREQUENCY NOISE. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A COMPREHENSIVE DESIGN DEMONSTRATING THAT PHOTON-COUNTING SENSITIVITY IS POSSIBLE IN A SMALL-VOLUME AL KID. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED ULTRA-HIGH QUALITY FACTORS IN RESONATORS MADE OF VERY THIN (#tilde#10 NM) AL FILMS WITH LONG ELECTRON LIFETIMES. THESE ARE THE CRITICAL MATERIAL PARAMETERS FOR REACHING PHOTON-COUNTING SENSITIVITY LEVELS. IN OUR PROPOSED WORK PLAN OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO IMPLEMENT THESE HIGH QUALITY FILMS INTO OUR OPTICALLYCOUPLED SMALL-VOLUME KID DESIGN AND DEMONSTRATE PHOTON-COUNTING SENSITIVITY. THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PHOTON-COUNTING TECHNOLOGY WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE SENSITIVITY OF THE OST MISSION, MAKING IT MORE SCIENTIFICALLY COMPETITIVE THAN ONE BASED ON POWER DETECTORS. PHOTON-COUNTING AT THE BACKGROUND LIMIT PROVIDES A X4 INCREASE IN OBSERVATION SPEED OVER THAT OF BACKGROUND-LIMITED POWER DETECTION, SINCE THERE IS NO NEED TO MEASURE AND SUBTRACT A ZERO POINT. PHOTON-COUNTING DETECTORS WILL ENABLE AN INSTRUMENT ON THE OST TO OBSERVE THE FINE STRUCTURE LINES OF GALAXIES WHICH ARE CURRENTLY ONLY OBSERVABLE AT REDSHIFTS OF Z#tilde#1, OUT TO REDSHIFTS OF Z=6, PROBING THE EARLY STAGES OF GALAXY, STAR AND PLANET FORMATION.

ONE KEY PATHWAY IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF FREE-FLOATING SUBSTELLAR OBJECTS THAT NOT ONLY SHARE COMMON TEMPERATURES WITH EXOPLANETS BUT ALSO COMMON MASSES AND THUS SURFACE GRAVITIES. IN RECENT YEARS, SEARCHES FOR EVER COLDER FREE-FLOATING OBJECTS HAVE STEADILY PUSHED THE CENSUS TO EVER LOWER MASSES AND FINALLY INTO THIS LONG-SOUGHT PLANETARY-MASS REGIME (5-15 JUPITER MASSES;  Y  DWARFS). THE EMPIRICAL BACKBONE OF THE EXPLORATION OF THESE NEW SUBSTELLAR SAMPLES IS THE ACCURATE MEASUREMENT OF DISTANCES VIA TRIGONOMETRIC PARALLAXES. DISTANCES ALLOW US TO MAKE EMPIRICAL SEQUENCES OF ABSOLUTE MAGNITUDE VERSUS COLOR AND SPECTRAL TYPE TO COMPARE TO BETTER STUDIED  NORMAL  BROWN DWARFS, AS WELL AS PROVIDING ABSOLUTE BOLOMETRIC FLUXES AND THEREBY LUMINOSITIES AND TEMPERATURES. HOWEVER, UNLIKE SIMPLE PHOTOMETRY OR SPECTROSCOPY, PARALLAX MEASUREMENTS ARE TIME CONSUMING AND PRONE TO LARGE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS WHEN ATTEMPTED BY COMBINING DATA FROM MULTIPLE TELESCOPES AND BANDPASSES. SPITZER/IRAC IS POISED TO DELIVER THE DEFINITIVE SAMPLE OF PARALLAX DISTANCES FOR THE COLDEST BROWN DWARFS. IT IS THE ONLY FACILITY CAPABLE OF MEASURING HIGH-PRECISION ASTROMETRY EFFICIENTLY FOR A LARGE SAMPLE OF SUCH FAINT SUBSTELLAR OBJECTS, AS VALIDATED BY OUR PAST WORK. SPITZER WAS NEVER INTENDED TO DELIVER HIGH QUALITY ASTROMETRY, BUT USING OUR CUSTOM BUILT ASTROMETRIC PIPELINE WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY PRODUCED THE FIRST PRECISE IRAC ASTROMETRY AND MEASURED DISTANCES FOR A SMALL INITIAL SAMPLE OF THE COLDEST BROWN DWARFS (DUPUY&KRAUS 2013). WE SHOWED THAT IN SPITE OF THE SEEMINGLY SUBTLE SPECTRAL CHANGES FROM T8 TO Y0 (ONLY 2 SUBTYPES), THE MEAN EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE PLUMMETS BY ALMOST A FACTOR OF 2, FROM #tilde#700 K FOR T8 DWARFS TO #tilde#400 K FOR Y0 DWARFS. EVEN IN THIS SMALL SAMPLE, WE FOUND SOME OBJECTS THAT SEEMED TO DEFY THE EXPECTATION THAT LATER SPECTRAL TYPE CORRESPONDS TO COOLER TEMPERATURE. THIS MAY POINT TO COMPLEXITY IN THE ATTEMPT TO SPECTRAL TYPE PLANETARY MASS OBJECTS, AS OTHER PARAMETERS LIKE GRAVITY OR NONEQUILIBRIUM CHEMISTRY COULD BECOME JUST AS IMPORTANT AS TEMPERATURE. HOWEVER, A SAMPLE LARGER THAN ONE OR TWO OBJECTS PER SPECTRAL TYPE BIN IS REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY DEFINITIVE STATEMENTS ABOUT PHYSICAL TRENDS. WE PROPOSE A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF THE COLDEST KNOWN BROWN DWARFS BY MEASURING ACCURATE DISTANCES FROM SPITZER PARALLAXES. WE WILL USE ALL DATA IN THE SPITZER ARCHIVE SUITABLE FOR PARALLAXES TO PERFORM A HOMOGENEOUS ANALYSIS OF A COMPLETE SAMPLE OF THE LATEST T AND Y DWARFS. OUR PROPOSED WORK WILL ROUGHLY TRIPLE THE SAMPLE SIZE AND FILL IN MAJOR GAPS AT THE T9.5 AND>Y0 SPECTRAL TYPES (#tilde#300-350 K) THAT PRODUCED SOME OF THE MOST PUZZLING RESULTS IN OUR PREVIOUS WORK. THE LONGER TIME BASELINE WILL ENABLE>3X MORE PRECISE PARALLAX MEASUREMENTS THAN IS POSSIBLE FROM THE GROUND FOR SIMILARLY FAINT OBJECTS. THE RESULTING EMPIRICAL SEQUENCES OF ABSOLUTE MAGNITUDE WILL PROVIDE A TOUCHSTONE FOR COMPARING BOTH MODELS AND DATA, E.G., FROM DIRECTLY IMAGED EXOPLANETS. WE WILL ALSO USE THE ABSOLUTE FLUXES TO DERIVE BOLOMETRIC LUMINOSITIES FOR OUR SAMPLE. COMBINING THESE WITH WELL-ESTABLISHED MODEL RADII WILL RESULT IN ROBUST TEMPERATURE DETERMINATIONS THAT WILL ALLOW DEEPER SCRUTINY OF WHETHER TEMPERATURE OR A MORE COMPLEX MIX OF PHYSICAL PROPERTIES DRIVES SPECTRAL VARIATIONS IN THE PLANETARY MASS REGIME. FINALLY, OUR ASTROMETRIC MONITORING WILL NATURALLY ALLOW US TO EXAMINE THE POPULATION S KINEMATICS, AND THE LONG TIME BASELINE WILL ALLOW A NOVEL SEARCH FOR LOWER MASS COMPANIONS VIA NONLINEAR PERTURBATIONS. OUR PROPOSED WORK WILL RESULT IN A DEFINITIVE BENCHMARK SAMPLE FOR BOTH THE BROWN DWARF AND EXOPLANET COMMUNITIES, PROVIDING CONTEXT FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE EFFORTS TO CHARACTERIZE BROWN DWARFS, DIRECTLY IMAGED PLANETS, AND THE COOL TRANSITING PLANETS PROBED BY SECONDARY ECLIPSE MEASUREMENTS."

HIRMES COMBINATION OF SENSITIVITY, WAVELENGTH RANGE, AND SPECTRAL RESOLVING POWER PROVIDES A CRITICAL NEW CAPABILITY. OVER THE COURSE OF 10 MILLION YEARS, ACCRETION DISKS AROUND PRE-MAIN SEQUENCE STARS TRANSFORM FROM GAS-RICH REMNANTS OF STAR FORMATION INTO YOUNG PLANETARY SYSTEMS. THE PRIMARY PLANET-FORMING REGION IN THESE PROTOPLANETARY DISKS IS LOCATED WITHIN 20 ASTRONOMICAL UNITS AU OF THE SYSTEM S CENTER. THIS REGION IS CHARACTERIZED BY A MIXTURE OF WARM AND COLD GAS, DUST AND ICE, AND HAS BEEN ANALYZED USING A RANGE OF MOLECULAR AND ATOMIC LINES AND SOLID-STATE FEATURES IN THE MID- TO FAR-INFRARED. HOWEVER TO DELVE MORE DEEPLY TOWARD UNDERSTANDING PLANET FORMATION AND THE CREATION OF PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES REQUIRES THE HIGH-RESOLUTION MID- TO FAR-INFRARED (IR) SPECTROSCOPY HIRMES PROVIDES. HIRMES IS DESIGNED TO PERFORM DETAILED STUDIES OF IMPORTANT DISK CONSTITUENTS: WATER VAPOR AND ICE THESE MATERIALS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN FORMING GIANT PLANET CORES AND PRODUCING HABITABLE CONDITIONS ON TERRESTRIAL PLANETS, AND NEUTRAL OXYGEN, AT TRACER OF DISK CHEMISTRY AND RADIAL STRUCTURE. HIRMES ALSO MEASURES MOLECULAR HYDROGEN THROUGH ITS TRACER, HYDROGEN DEUTERIDE HD WHICH SHOULD MAKE UP MOST OF A PROTOPLANETARY DISK MASS, BUT IS NOT ACCESSIBLE WITH EXISTING INSTRUMENTS. HIRMES, WITH ITS HIGH SPECTRAL RESOLUTION, RESOLVES NARROW EMISSION LINES AND INDEPENDENTLY DETERMINES THEIR ORIGIN IN A DISK FROM VELOCITY INFORMATION, THUS BREAKING DEGENERACIES IN COMPLEX DISK MODELS. HIRMES MEASUREMENTS TRACE DISK DENSITY, TEMPERATURE, AND VELOCITY STRUCTURE, AS WELL AS H2O VAPOR AND ICE TO LOCATE THE TRANSITION ZONE BETWEEN GASEOUS AND FROZEN WATER. OBSERVATIONS OF H2 OR BETTER YET ITS DEUTERATED COUNTERPART HD, CAN UNIQUELY DETERMINE THE DISK GAS MASS AND THE DEGREE OF SETTLING OF THE SOLID MATERIAL IN DISKS.

THE INFRARED SPECTROGRAPH IRS ON SPITZER PROVIDED DATA UP TO #tilde#37 M WITH A SPECTRAL RESOLVING POWER OF 600, WHICH IS TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE LESS THAN HIRMES AND INSUFFICIENT TO RESOLVE LINES FROM PROTOPLANETARY DISKS. HIRMES RANGE CONTAINS THE TWO WATER-ICE FEATURES THAT ARE THE ONLY EMISSION TRACERS OF ICE IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS AND HAVE BEEN POORLY COVERED BY PREVIOUS SPACE MISSIONS. THIS ENSEMBLE OF DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS, WHICH WILL BE UNIQUE TO SOFIA WHEN IT INCORPORATES HIRMES, PROMISES TO PROVIDE NEW INSIGHT INTO THE EVOLUTION OF PLANETARY SYSTEMS. HIRMES ON SOFIA CONTRIBUTES IN A UNIQUE WAY, EVEN IN THE ERA OF ATACAMA LARGE MILLIMETER ARRAY ALMA, JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE JWST, HERSCHEL, SPITZER, AND ALL CURRENT AND PLANNED SOFIA INSTRUMENTS. THE HERSCHEL/PHOTOCONDUCTOR ARRAY CAMERA AND SPECTROMETER PACS PROVIDED SPECTRAL DATA AT WAVELENGTHS>55 M, BUT ITS RELATIVELY LOW SPECTRAL RESOLVING POWER IS INSUFFICIENT TO OBTAIN LINE PROFILES FROM GALACTIC SOURCES.

WE PLAN TO ADDRESS THESE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS WITH A MAJOR STEP FORWARD IN OUR ABILITY TO ANALYZE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN GALAXIES AND THEIR CIRCUMGALACTIC GAS.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE SPEED AND PROFILE OF THE MERIDIONAL FLOW DETERMINES THE DURATION OF THE SOLAR CYCLE IN FLUX-TRANSPORT DYNAMO MODELS, ITS RISE AND FALL PATTERN, THE POLAR FIELD STRENGTH AND THE TIMING OF ITS REVERSAL. THE STRENGTH OF THE POLAR FIELD OF THE PREVIOUS MINIMUM PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN DETERMINING THE STRENGTH OF THE NEXT CYCLE. THEREFORE IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE EVOLUTION OF THE POLAR FIELD, WHICH IS LARGELY GOVERNED BY THE TRANSPORT BY MERIDIONAL CIRCULATION. WE PROPOSE TO STUDY THE MERIDIONAL FLOW IN THE SOLAR CONVECTION ZONE FROM THE SURFACE TO THE NEAR-SURFACE SHEAR LAYER USING RING-DIAGRAM ANALYSIS AND IN THE LOWER CONVECTION ZONE USING TIME-DISTANCE ANALYSIS ANALYZING SDO/HMI DOPPLERGRAMS. WE WILL THEN ASSIMILATE THE MERIDIONAL FLOW AND THE SURFACE MAGNETIC FIELD FROM SDO/ HMI INTO FLUX-TRANSPORT DYNAMO MODELS AND DRIVE THE MODELS WITH THE FLOWS. TO COVER MORE THAN ONE SOLAR CYCLE, WE WILL ANALYZE MDI DATA SETS. THE GOALS OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT ARE (I) TO DETERMINE THE INFLUENCE OF THE MERIDIONAL FLOW ON DYNAMO-GENERATED MAGNETIC FIELDS DURING DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE SOLAR CYCLE AND (II) TO USE THE RESULTS TO PREDICT THE POLAR FIELDS DURING THE UPCOMING CYCLE MINIMUM AND THE STRENGTH OF CYCLE 25. THIS IS TIMELY SINCE SDO/HMI OBSERVATIONS COVER SOLAR CYCLE 24 AND THE HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF HMI ALLOWS US TO MEASURE SUBSURFACE MERIDIONAL FLOWS AT HIGH LATITUDES TO ABOUT 75 DEGREE. BY ASSIMILATING MERIDIONAL FLOWS AND SURFACE MAGNETIC FIELDS FROM SDO/HMI INTO DYNAMO MODELS, WE WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE HOW WELL FLOW MEASUREMENTS CAN CONSTRAIN THE DYNAMO. RELEVANCE: THIS PROPOSAL DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE FIRST SCIENCE GOAL FROM THE HELIOPHYSICS DECADAL SURVEY:  DETERMINE THE ORIGINS OF THE SUN S ACTIVITY AND PREDICT THE VARIATIONS IN THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT . THE WORK PROPOSED HERE WILL GREATLY ENHANCE THE SCIENTIFIC RETURN OF THE SDO/HMI MISSION. METHODOLOGY: WE PROPOSE TO DETERMINE THE MERIDIONAL FLOW FROM SDO/HMI DOPPLERGRAMS USING TWO DIFFERENT HELIOSEISMIC TECHNIQUES. TO DETERMINE THE MERIDIONAL FLOW FROM THE SURFACE TO A DEPTH OF ABOUT 40 MM ON TIME SCALES OF DAYS AND MONTHS, WE WILL USE RINGDIAGRAM ANALYSIS WITH THREE TILE SIZES. TO DISCERN THE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ACTIVE REGIONS, WE WILL STUDY FLOWS FROM SMALL 5 DEGREE TILES. TO REACH DEPTHS OF ABOUT 40 MM AND STUDY THE INFLUENCE OF THE NEAR-SURFACE SHEAR LAYER, WE WILL USE FLOWS FROM 30 DEGREE TILES. WE WILL CROSS-VALIDATE THESE RESULTS WITH THOSE FROM THE STANDARD 15 DEGREE TILES COVERING DEPTHS FROM THE SURFACE TO ABOUT 16 MM. TO DETERMINE THE MERIDIONAL FLOW IN THE LOWER HALF OF THE CONVECTION ZONE ON TIME SCALES OF TWO YEARS, WE WILL USE A CUSTOMIZED TIMEDISTANCE ANALYSIS. THE KEY POINT IS TO PERFORM THE ANALYSIS IN SPHERICAL GEOMETRY, WHICH ALLOWS US TO ISOLATE ACOUSTIC WAVES PROPAGATING TO DEEP LAYERS. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO CONSTRAIN THE RETURN FLOW NEAR THE BASE OF THE CONVECTION ZONE AND THE NUMBER OF CELLS WITH DEPTH. WE WILL USE AN ENSEMBLE KALMAN FILTER TO ASSIMILATE THE SUBSURFACE MERIDIONAL FLOW AND THE SURFACE MAGNETOGRAMS INTO THE DYNAMO MODEL AND OPERATE THE MODEL IN THE ANALYSES AND THE FORECAST MODE, SO THAT WE CAN RESOLVE UNCERTAINTIES IN MODEL INGREDIENTS IN THE ANALYSES PHASE AND CORRECTLY HINDCAST AND FORECAST THE POLAR FIELDS AND PROPERTIES OF SOLAR CYCLES 24 AND 25 IN THE FORECAST PHASE. WE WILL CHECK THE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE MERIDIONAL FLOWS DETERMINED IN THE UPPER AND LOWER CONVECTION ZONE ON DIFFERENT TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL SCALES, AS WELL AS WHETHER THE MODEL WORKS BEST WITH HIGH OR LOW MAGNETIC DIFFUSIVITY. WE WILL DETERMINE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERIDIONAL FLOW AT HIGH LATITUDES FOR THE POLEWARD FLUX TRANSPORT AND POLAR FIELD FEATURES, AND IN TURN FOR THE CYCLE 25 AMPLITUDE"

MAGNETIC FIELDS FORM A FOUNDATION FOR ALL SOLAR ACTIVE PHENOMENA FROM TINY G-BAND BRIGHT POINTS TO SUNSPOTS AND CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS (CMES). THEY SERVE AS A RESERVOIR OF ENERGY FOR FLARES, PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN TRIGGERING MECHANISMS FOR CMES, AND PROVIDE THE MEANS OF TRANSPORTING ENERGY FROM THE PHOTOSPHERE TO CORONA. THUS, ARGUABLY, THE MAGNETOGRAPH SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A CRITICAL INSTRUMENT FOR EVERY HELIOPHYSICS MISSION THAT STUDIES THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE OR THE EFFECTS OF SOLAR ACTIVITY ON HELIOSPHERE. WHILE THE IMPORTANCE OF MAGNETOGRAPH INSTRUMENT IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED BY THE COMMUNITY, IN PRACTICE, THEIR INCLUSION AS A SPACECRAFT PAYLOAD IS OFTEN LIMITED DUE TO WEIGHT AND SIZE RESTRICTIONS. THE MAGNETOGRAPH CONCEPTS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY IN USE REQUIRE SAMPLING A MAGNETO-SENSITIVE SPECTRAL LINE AT DIFFERENT POSITIONS ACROSS SOLAR DISK. SPECTROGRAPH-BASED MAGNETOGRAPHS ARE SUPERIOR IN TERMS OF SPECTRAL SAMPLING, BUT REQUIRE SCANNING OF SOLAR IMAGE TO BUILD UP ITS MAGNETIC MAP. NARROW-BAND FILTER-BASED MAGNETOGRAPHS TAKE SIMULTANEOUS  SNAPSHOTS  OF EXTENDED AREA OF SOLAR SURFACE, BUT REQUIRE TAKING MULTIPLE OBSERVATIONS WITH DIFFERENT WAVELENGTH OFFSET BETWEEN SEPARATE FRAMES. BOTH APPROACHES MAY REQUIRE RELATIVELY LARGE NUMBER OF OPTICAL AND ELECTRO-MECHANICAL ELEMENTS FOR SPECTRAL TUNING AND/OR SPATIAL SCANNING. THESE ADDITION ELEMENTS TEND TO INCREASE THE OVERALL WEIGHT AND SIZE OF INSTRUMENT, AND THE ADDED COMPLEXITY MIGHT AFFECT THE RELIABILITY OF SYSTEM. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: AS THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS PROJECT, WE WILL EXPLORE A NOVEL ALTERNATIVE TO THE STANDARD FILTER BASED MAGNETOGRAPH, WHICH WE CALL THE SIMPLEST MAGNETOGRAPH. THE PROPOSED INSTRUMENT CONCEPT IS BASED ON MEASURING A BROAD-BAND POLARIZATION OVER THE WHOLE LINE PROFILE, WHICH COULD BE DONE WITHOUT MOVING OPTICAL ELEMENTS AND COMPLICATED OPTICAL SCHEMES. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS CONCEPT WILL LEAD TO CREATION OF EXTREMELY SIMPLE AND COMPACT LINE-OF-SIGHT (LOS) OR FULL VECTOR MAGNETOGRAPH SUITABLE FOR SPACE MISSIONS. SUCH INSTRUMENT COULD BE ESPECIALLY ATTRACTIVE FOR SPACE WEATHER-ORIENTED MISSIONS. THE METHODOLOGY: THE CONCEPT OF THE PROPOSED MAGNETOGRAPH IS BASED ON A WELL-KNOWN FACT THAT ZEEMAN SPLIT SPECTRUM LINES IN A LINEOF- SIGHT (LOS) FIELD ARE ASYMMETRIC, WITH ONE OF THE V STOKES PROFILE LOBES STRONGER THAN THE OTHER IN A WAY THAT SWITCHES WITH POLARITY. IN TRANSVERSE FIELD, THERE IS A NET LINEAR POLARIZATION AVERAGED ACROSS THE LINE PROFILE BECAUSE THE CENTRAL PART OF THE SPECTRUM LINE IS SATURATED RELATIVE TO THE WINGS SO THE WING POLARIZATION DOMINATES IN Q AND U POLARIZATION PROFILES. THUS, MEASURING NET POLARIZATION OVER THE ENTIRE SPECTRAL LINE PROFILE (WITHOUT SCANNING IN SPECTRAL OR SPATIAL DIRECTIONS) ALLOWS TO DETERMINE BOTH POLARITY AND THE FIELD STRENGTH (MAGNETIC FLUX) FOR EACH PIXEL OF IMAGE. PRELIMINARY TESTS WITH STOKES-V SPECTRA TAKEN WITH GONG INSTRUMENT SUPPORT THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS APPROACH. PROPOSED CONTRIBUTION: THE NSO TEAM WILL INVESTIGATE THE CONCEPT OF THIS SIMPLEST MAGNETOGRAPH BOTH VIA MODELING AND LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS. WE WILL ALSO BUILD A PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT. THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS MAGNETOGRAPH WILL BE TESTED AT THE GROUNDBASED TELESCOPES OPERATED BY THE NSO. IN ADDITION, THE PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT CAN BE PROPOSED FOR FLIGHT ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AND PERHAPS ALSO ON MISSION OF OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS THE UK/EU LAGRANGE L5 MISSION."

WE PROPOSE A PLAN THAT WILL MATURE THESE TECHNOLOGIES FOR CORONAGRAPHY WITH ON-AXIS SEGMENTED MIRROR TELESCOPES TO TRL 4 BY MID-DECADE WITH THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS: 1. NUMERICAL STUDIES FOR CORONAGRAPH OPTIMIZATION AND WAVEFRONT SHAPING TO YIELD HIGH-CONTRAST POINT SPREAD FUNCTION DARK ZONES. 2. PRECISION SEGMENT PHASING CONCEPTS AND ALGORITHMS THAT WILL IMPROVE THE STATE OF THE ART BY ONE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE, AND WILL BE APPLICABLE TO ANY SEGMENTED TELESCOPE. 3. A SYSTEM-LEVEL DEMONSTRATION INTEGRATING SEGMENT PRECISION PHASING, WAVEFRONT CONTROL AND SHAPING, TOGETHER WITH ADVANCED CORONAGRAPHY. SUCCESS OF THIS RESEARCH WILL BRING GAME-CHANGING SOLUTIONS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO THE FIELD OF HIGH-CONTRAST IMAGING AND OPTICAL ASTRONOMY. USING LIGHTWEIGHT, FOLDED AND SEGMENTED TELESCOPE DESIGNS, LARGER DIRECT IMAGING MISSIONS WILL BE POSSIBLE USING SMALLER LAUNCHERS, AND THEREFORE FEASIBLE AT A LOWER COST. IN ADDITION, THE CONCEPTS AND ALGORITHMS DELIVERED BY THIS RESEARCH WILL BENEFIT ANY SEGMENTED TELESCOPE THAT IS BUILT. OUR PLAN WILL BRING THESE TECHNOLOGIES TO TRL 4 IN FOUR YEARS; THIS IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE SCHEDULE RECOMMENDED BY THE DECADAL SURVEY TO INVEST IN TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT FOR A FUTURE HIGH-CONTRAST IMAGING MISSION DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE DECADE."

PRIMITIVE MATERIAL LEFT OVER FROM THE FORMATION OF OUR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM HAS FOR A LONG TIME YIELDED TANTALIZING CLUES TO A HETEROGENOUS NEBULA WITH INTRICATE DYNAMICAL, THERMAL AND CHEMICAL STRUCTURE THAT ULTIMATELY LED TO A GREAT DIVERSITY IN THE PLANETS AND PLANETESIMALS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. THE DISCOVERY OF A RICH CHEMISTRY IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS VIA A FOREST OF STRONG 3-40 MICRON MOLECULAR EMISSION LINES (H2O, OH, CO2, HCN, C2H2,...) ALLOWS US FOR THE FIRST TIME TO INVESTIGATE CHEMICAL DIVERSITY IN OTHER PLANET-FORMING ENVIRONMMENTS (SALYK ET AL. 2008; CARR&amp;NAJITA 2008). FURTHER EFFORTS, SUPPORTED BY THE ORIGINS PROGRAM, HAS ESTABLISHED THAT THIS MOLECULAR FOREST IS SEEN IN THE DISKS SURROUNDING MOST YOUNG SOLAR-TYPE STARS (PONTOPPIDAN ET AL. 2010).  WE PROPOSE A 3-YEAR PROGRAM TO ANALYZE OUR GROWING MULTI-WAVELENGTH DATABASE OF OBSERVATIONS OF WATER, OH AND ORGANIC MOLECULES IN THE SURFACES OF PROTOPLANETARY DISKS. THE DATABASE INCLUDES HIGH (R#tilde#25,000-100,000) AND MEDIUM RESOLUTION (R#tilde#600-3000) 3-200 MICRON SPECTRA FROM A WIDE RANGE OF FACILITIES (KECK-NIRSPEC, VLT-CRIRES, SPITZER-IRS, VLT-VISIR, GEMINI-MICHELLE AND HERSCHEL-PACS). OUR PREVIOUS EFFORTS HAVE FOCUSED ON DEMONSTRATING FEASIBILITY FOR OBSERVING WATER AND OTHER MOLECULES IN PLANET-FORMING REGIONS, BUILDING STATISTICS TO SHOW THAT THE MOLECULAR FOREST IS UBIQUITOUS IN DISKS AROUND LOW-MASS AND SOLAR-TYPE STARS AND TAKING THE FIRST STEPS IN UNDERSTANDING THE IMPLIED CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES. NOW, AS THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP, WE WILL COMBINE MULTI-WAVELENGTH DATA FROM OUR UNIQUE MULTI-WAVELENGTH DATABASE TO MAP THE RADIAL DISTRIBUTION OF, IN PARTICULAR, WATER AND ITS DERIVATIVES.  1)	WE WILL USE BOTH LINE PROFILE INFORMATION FROM THE HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTRA, AS WELL AS LINE STRENGTHS, FROM A COMBINATION OF HIGH AND LOW TEMPERATURE LINES TO CONSTRAIN THE RADIAL ABUNDANCE OF WATER VAPOR IN THE EMITTING SURFACES OF DISKS. DESPITE HIGH WATER ABUNDANCES INSIDE #tilde#1 AU, THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE DISK SURFACES ARE STRONGLY DEPLETED IN WATER BOTH FROM THE GAS AND ICE PHASES, BY AS MUCH AS 6 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE, BEYOND 1-2 AU. THIS MAY BE DUE TO THE SETTLING OF ICY GRAINS AS PART OF THE FORMATION OF ICY  PLANETESIMALS (MEIJERINK ET AL. 2009; BERGIN ET AL. 2010). WE WISH TO QUANTIFY THE DEPLETION FACTOR AND ESTABLISH WHETHER THIS IS A COMMON PROPERTY OF ALL PROTOPLANETARY DISKS.  2)	WE WILL PURSUE CRITICAL NEW DATASETS USING UPCOMING OBSERVATIONAL FACILITIES, INCLUDING SPECTRALLY RESOLVED ROTATIONAL WATER LINES IN THE MID-INFRARED. VLT-VISIR, WITH WHICH WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DETECTED WATER LINES AT HIGH RESOLUTION, IS UNDERGOING A SIGNIFICANT HARDWARE UPGRADE WITH A PLANNED COMMISSIONING AROUND JANUARY 2012. THE UPGRADE INCLUDES A MUCH LARGER AND MORE SENSITIVE DETECTOR BASED ON TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED FOR JWST-MIRI, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE ITS EFFICIENCY BY 1-2 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. ON A LONGER TIME SCALE, SOFIA-EXES, JWST-NIRSPEC AND MIRI WILL BECOME ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR MOVING THIS FIELD FORWARD. PONTOPPIDAN IS A JWST-NIRSPEC INSTRUMENT SCIENTIST AT STSCI.  3)	3) WE WILL SEARCH FOR VARIABILITY OF WATER LINES ON TIME SCALES OF MONTHS AND COMPARE THEM TO VARIATION ALREADY SEEN IN CO GAS TO INVESTIGATE ITS ORIGIN. ONE INTRIGUING POSSIBILITY IS DYNAMICAL INTERACTION WITH PROTOPLANETS.   THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS HIGHLY RELEVANT FOR THE ORIGINS OF SOLAR SYSTEMS PROGRAM AS DESCRIBED IN THE SOLICITATION DOCUMENT.

THE ROLE OF MAST EXTENDS BEYOND THE ARCHIVE BASICS OF PROVIDING STORAGE OF AND USER-FRIENDLY ACCESS TO THESE DATA. THE RAPID IMPROVEMENT IN INTEROPERABILITY PROTOCOLS, WEB SERVICES, AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES, COUPLED WITH THE INCREASE IN THE QUANTITY, QUALITY, AND CONSISTENCY OF ASTRONOMICAL DATA, HAVE LARGELY ELIMINATED THE ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS THAT ONCE PARTITIONED ASTRONOMY ACCORDING TO WAVELENGTH REGIMES AND TECHNIQUES. IN THE PAST 3 YEARS WE HAVE SEEN MANY ENHANCEMENTS TO INTEROPERABILITY AND A RAPID GROWTH IN OUR SCIENCE-READY DATA HOLDINGS THAT SUPPORT HIGH IMPACT INVESTIGATIONS IN EVERY AREA OF ASTROPHYSICS. OUR VISION IS TO ENSURE THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF SEAMLESS INTER-ARCHIVE ACCESS AND COLLABORATION FOR THE SCIENTIFIC BENEFIT OF OUR USER COMMUNITY AND TO MAXIMIZE THE RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT MADE BY THE U.S. PUBLIC IN OUR SPACE ASTROPHYSICS PROGRAMS. THE 160 TERABYTE MAST DATA ARCHIVE IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ASTRONOMICAL COLLECTIONS AVAILABLE TODAY, CONTAINING IMAGES, SPECTRA, AND LIGHT CURVES OF THE VARIED ASTROPHYSICAL PHENOMENA THAT DOMINATE THE OPTICAL/UV REGIONS OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM. THE VALUE OF MAST STEMS FROM ITS ABILITY TO CONNECT SCIENTISTS TO THESE DATA VIA A VARIETY OF USER-FRIENDLY INTERFACES. THE UTILITY OF MAST MISSIONS IS DEMONSTRATED BY THE PUBLICATION RATE OF 970 SCIENTIFIC PAPERS PER YEAR THAT MAKE SUBSTANTIAL USE OF THESE DATA.

BY FUNDING MAST, NASA RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE EFFORTS, THE NEED FOR CONTINUITY OF ADVANCED ARCHIVAL SERVICES ACROSS MISSIONS LARGE AND SMALL, AND THE IMPERATIVE TO PROVIDE, AND EVEN IMPROVE, DATA SETS WELL AFTER THE DATA ARE COLLECTED. IN OUR IN-GUIDELINE SCENARIO, WE SEEK $14.3M OVER THE PERIOD FY12-FY16 TO SUPPORT 11.5-11.9 FTES. THIS LEVEL OF FUNDING WILL ALLOW US TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT PROFESSIONAL ARCHIVE SERVICES WE HAVE PROVIDED SINCE INCEPTION.

MEASURING THE ENERGETICS OF OUTFLOWS IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR NASA''S SCIENCE OBJECTIVE OF UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECT OF ENERGETIC PROCESSES AROUND SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLES ON THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT IN GALAXIES, CLUSTERS AND THE INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM. THEREFORE, THE MOST IMPORTANT GOALS IN THE STUDY OF THESE OUTFLOWS ARE TO MEASURE THEIR MASS FLUX, KINETIC LUMINOSITY, AND CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES IN ORDER TO ASSESS THEIR IMPORTANCE TO AGN FEEDBACK ON THEIR ENVIRONMENT. THE BROAD RANGE OF REDSHIFTS AND THE ACCESS TO SHORT REST WAVELENGTHS MADE POSSIBLE BY FAR ULTRAVIOLET SPECTROSCOPIC EXPLORER (FUSE) OBSERVATIONS OF AGN OPENS A VAST DISCOVERY SPACE USING THE MANY MORE DIAGNOSTIC LINES (COMPARED TO LONGER WAVELENGTHS) IN THE 500-1050 A RANGE (REST WAVELENGTHS) THAT SHOW UP AS ABSORPTION TROUGHS IN AGN OUTFLOWS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR THE DENSITY-SENSITIVE EXCITED-STATE TRANSITIONS OF HIGHLY IONIZED ELEMENTS (E.G., OIV* 790) THAT CAN YIELD THE DISTANCE OF THE OUTFLOWS FROM THE CENTRAL SOURCE, AND THE INCREASINGLY HIGHER IONIZATION SPECIES (O VI, NE VIII, NA IX AND MG X) THAT SUPPLY THE CRUCIAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE UV AND XRAY (SO-CALLED WARM ABSORBERS) MANIFESTATION OF AGN OUTFLOWS. OVER THE COURSE OF ITS 10 YEARS OF OPERATION, FUSE OBSERVED NEARLY TWO HUNDRED ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI (AGN) AT REDSHIFTS FROM LESS THAN 0.01 TO NEARLY 3. WHILE A SELECT FEW OF THE BRIGHTEST INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS HAVE BEEN STUDIED IN DETAIL, THE SURVEYS OF THE OVERALL DATA SET DONE TO DATE EXAMINED ONLY THE LOWEST REDSHIFT OBJECTS (Z<0.15), AND ONLY USING DATA FROM THE FIRST 6 YEARS OR SO OF THE MISSION. OUR PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF THE FUSE ARCHIVE REVEALS DOZENS OF AGN WITH APPROPRIATE CHARACTERISTICS FOR US TO CARRY OUT OUR PROPOSED PROGRAM OF STUDY. MANY OF THE BEST OBJECTS ALSO HAVE HST SPECTRA AVAILABLE, AND WE WILL USE THESE DATA TO PROVIDE COMPLEMENTARY MEASUREMENTS OF ABSORPTION LINES AT LONGER WAVELENGTHS. FOR THOSE OBJECTS WITH AVAILABLE X-RAY OBSERVATIONS, WE WILL ALSO USE THOSE DATA TO HELP UNDERSTAND THE FULL RANGE OF IONIZATION STATES IN THE ABSORBING GAS. OUR WORK WILL INVOLVE FIVE STEPS TO OBTAINING REAL MEASUREMENTS OF THE MASS FLUX, KINETIC LUMINOSITY, AND THE ABUNDANCES IN A LARGE SAMPLE OF AGN: 1. WE WILL MEASURING RELIABLE IONIC COLUMN DENSITIES FROM THE OBSERVED ABSORPTION TROUGHS, USING THE HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTRA TO OVERCOME THE EFFECTS OF NON-BLACK SATURATION. 2. WE WILL USE PHOTOIONIZATION MODELS TO MEASURE THE IONIZATION STATE AND TOTAL OUTFLOWING COLUMN DENSITY, FACILITATED BY OUR MEASUREMENTS OF ABSORPTION IN MULTIPLE IONIC STATES IN THE FUSE (AND HST) SPECTRA. 3. WE WILL DETERMINE THE CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES, INCLUDING RELATIVE ABUNDANCES FROM THE PHOTOIONIZATION MODELS, AND ABSOLUTE ABUNDANCES (I.E., RELATIVE TO HYDROGEN) SINCE WITH FUSE (TOGETHER WITH HST WHEN AVAILABLE) WE MEASURE SEVERAL LINES IN THE LYMAN SERIES, ALLOWING FOR AN ACCURATE DETERMINATION OF HI. 4. WE WILL DETERMINE THE DISTANCE OF THE OUTFLOW FROM THE CENTRAL SOURCE BY MEASURING THE NUMBER DENSITY (N_H) VIA TROUGHS FROM METASTABLE LEVELS AND USING THE N_H AND IONIZATION PARAMETER (U) TO SOLVE FOR THE DISTANCE OF THE ABSORBING GAS. 5. WE WILL CONSTRAIN THE FRACTION OF SOLID ANGLE SUBTENDED BY THE OUTFLOW FROM THE CENTRAL CONTINUUM SOURCE BY USING THE FRACTION OF OUTFLOWS DETECTED IN OUR LARGE SAMPLE AS A PROXY FOR THE GLOBAL COVERING FRACTION. AS A PRODUCT OF OUR STUDY, WE WILL OPTIMALLY REPROCESS AND PRODUCE HIGH QUALITY MERGED SPECTRA FOR ALL THE FUSE OBSERVATIONS OF AGN, WHICH WE WILL SUBMIT TO THE MAST ARCHIVE FOR FURTHER USE BY THE ASTRONOMICAL COMMUNITY.

OUR NEW ALGORITHM, WHICH WE NAMED ADAPTIVE COMPENSATION OF APERTURE DISCONTINUITIES (ACAD), PROVIDES THE ABILITY TO COMPENSATE FOR APERTURE DISCONTINUITIES (SEGMENT GAPS AND/OR SECONDARY MIRROR SUPPORTS) BY CONTROLLING DEFORMABLE MIRRORS IN A NONLINEAR WAVEFRONT CONTROL REGIME NOT UTILIZED BEFORE BUT CONCEPTUALLY SIMILAR TO THE BEAM RESHAPING USED IN PIAA CORONAGRAPHY. WE PROPOSE HERE AN IN-AIR DEMONSTRATION AT 1E-7 CONTRAST, ENABLED BY ADDING A SECOND DEFORMABLE MIRROR TO OUR CURRENT TEST-BED. THIS EXPANSION OF THE SCOPE OF OUR CURRENT EFFORTS IN EXOPLANET IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES WILL ENABLING US TO DEMONSTRATE AN INTEGRATED SOLUTION FOR WAVEFRONT CONTROL AND STARLIGHT SUPPRESSION ON COMPLEX APERTURE GEOMETRIES. IT IS DIRECTLY APPLICABLE AT SCALES FROM MODERATE-COST EXOPLANET PROBE MISSIONS TO THE 2.4 M AFTA TELESCOPES TO FUTURE FLAGSHIP UVOIR OBSERVATORIES WITH APERTURES POTENTIALLY 16-20 M. SEARCHING FOR NEARBY HABITABLE WORLDS WITH DIRECT IMAGING IS ONE OF THE TOP SCIENTIFIC PRIORITIES ESTABLISHED BY THE ASTRO2010 DECADAL SURVEY. ACHIEVING THIS AMBITIOUS GOAL WILL REQUIRE 1E-10 CONTRAST ON A TELESCOPE LARGE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE ANGULAR RESOLUTION AND SENSITIVITY TO PLANETS AROUND A SIGNIFICANT SAMPLE OF NEARBY STARS. SUCH A MISSION MUST OF COURSE ALSO BE REALIZED AT AN ACHIEVABLE COST. LIGHTWEIGHT SEGMENTED MIRROR TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS LARGER DIAMETER OPTICS TO FIT IN ANY GIVEN LAUNCH VEHICLE AS COMPARED TO MONOLITHIC MIRRORS, AND LOWERS TOTAL LIFE-CYCLE COSTS FROM CONSTRUCTION THROUGH INTEGRATION&TEST, MAKING IT A COMPELLING OPTION FOR FUTURE LARGE SPACE TELESCOPES. AT SMALLER SCALES, ON-AXIS DESIGNS WITH SECONDARY OBSCURATIONS AND SUPPORTS ARE LESS CHALLENGING TO FABRICATE AND THUS MORE AFFORDABLE THAN THE OFF-AXIS UNOBSCURED PRIMARY MIRROR DESIGNS ENVISIONED IN MANY PAST MISSION CONCEPT STUDIES. BUT UNTIL RECENTLY, IT WAS BELIEVED THAT INTERNAL CORONAGRAPHS WERE INCAPABLE OF YIELDING VERY HIGH CONTRAST ON SEGMENTED OR OBSCURED TELESCOPES. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS NOW SHOW THAT THERE IS IN FACT A CLEAR PATH TO HIGH CONTRAST CORONAGRAPHY ON SUCH APERTURES. FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS WE HAVE BEEN PURSUING HIGH CONTRAST IMAGING DEVELOPMENT FOR SEGMENTED TELESCOPES, SUPPORTED IN PART BY APRA (AWARD NNX12AG05G, ROSES 2011). THE ACAD ALGORITHM, DEVELOPED IN THE COURSE OF OUR CURRENT APRA, IN PRINCIPLE APPEARS TO ENABLE HIGH CONTRAST CORONAGRAPHY ON OBSCURED APERTURES AS WE SET OUT TO ACHIEVE. THE PRACTICAL LABORATORY DEMONSTRATION OF THIS NEW ALGORITHM NOW REQUIRES ADDITIONAL RESOURCES NOT FORESEEN AT THE TIME OF OUR PRIOR PROPOSAL. CHIEF OF THESE IS THE NEED FOR A SECOND BOSTON MICROMACHINES DEFORMABLE MIRROR. THE ACAD ALGORITHM RELIES ON THE CONVERSION OF PHASE TO AMPLITUDE AS LIGHT PROPAGATES BETWEEN TWO DEFORMABLE MIRRORS AT DIFFERING OPTICAL CONJUGATES; A SECOND DM IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO ITS LABORATORY DEMONSTRATION AND VALIDATION. WE PROPOSE NOW TO DEMONSTRATE THE ACAD ALGORITHM IN AIR AT A CONTRAST OF #tilde#1E-7 IN NARROW SPECTRAL BANDS, AND EXTEND THAT PERFORMANCE THROUGH DEVELOPMENT OF BROAD BAND #tilde# 20%) OPTIMIZATION METHODS. NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS A PROPER SUBSET OF AN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL SUBMITTED TO SAT-TDEM BY OUR TEAM THAT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL HIGHER TRL DEMONSTRATIONS."

FLARES ARE OFTEN SEEN AS A TUMULTUOUS BREAKUP OF A PREVIOUSLY STABLE CONFIGURATION LEADING TO RELEASE OF A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ENERGY, MATERIAL ERUPTION, PARTICLE ACCELERATION, AND RESTRUCTURING OF MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION. THIS MAGNETIC RESTRUCTURING MAY BE A KEY FOR UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSICS OF PROCESSES TAKING PLACE THROUGHOUT THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE IN RESPONSE TO FLARES: MAGNETIC FIELD SUPPLIES ENERGY TO FLARES, AND SERVES AS A TRIGGER AND AS A CONDUIT OF ENERGY TRANSPORT. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO INVESTIGATE THE MAGNETIC RESTRUCTURING ASSOCIATED WITH FLARES AND ITS EFFECTS ON THERMODYNAMIC PROCESSES IN THE LOW SOLAR ATMOSPHERE. THE CHANGES IN THE MAGNETIC FIELD WILL BE EVALUATED IN RESPECT TO TWO ALTERNATIVE MODELS: CORONAL IMPLOSION AND TWIST REMOVAL MODEL. EITHER OF THESE SCENARIOS MAY TAKE PLACE IN FLARES, BUT THE TWO MODELS CAN BE DISTINGUISHED BASED ON EXPECTED MAGNETIC FIELD CHANGES. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS BASED ON FULL VECTOR MAGNETIC FIELD DATA FROM TWO NASA MISSIONS, SDO AND HINODE, AND SUPPLEMENTED WITH OBSERVATIONS FROM TWO GROUND-BASED INSTRUMENTS, GONG (LINE-OF-SIGHT ONLY) AND SOLIS (VECTOR DATA). THESE TWO AUXILIARY DATA SETS WILL ENHANCE THE INTERPRETATION OF SDO DATA, STRENGTHEN THE STATISTICS. THE AUXILIARY DATA SETS COULD BE CRITICAL IN FINDING THE PROPER INTERPRETATION IN CASES WHEN THE MAGNETIC FIELD DERIVATIONS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE POOR SPECTRAL RESOLUTION OF HMI, OR HAMPERED BY THE POOR TEMPORAL CADENCE OF SOT/SP. THESE DATA SETS WILL ALSO ALLOW INCLUDING FLARES PRIOR TO SDO LAUNCH FOR GREATER STATISTICAL SAMPLE, IF NEEDED. SOLIS CA II 854.2 NM LINE-OF-SIGHT (LOS) MAGNETOGRAMS WILL EXPAND THE STUDY TO THE CHROMOSPHERE. USING SDO VECTOR MAGNETOGRAMS WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE CHANGES IN ORIENTATION AND STRENGTH OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD AND THE ASSOCIATED CHANGES IN LORENTZ FORCE. FOR SELECTED CASES, WE WILL ALSO DERIVE PSEUDO-VECTOR FIELDS USING HIGH-CADENCE SDO/HMI AND GONG LINE-OF-SIGHT (LOS) MAGNETOGRAMS BASED ON THE APPROACH OF AZIMUTHAL AVERAGING. EVOLUTION OF THE DERIVED PSEUDO-VECTOR FIELDS DURING FLARES WILL BE INVESTIGATED AND VALIDATED WITH THE RESULT FROM SDO/HMI VECTOR MAGNETOGRAMS. TO INVESTIGATE CHANGES IN THERMODYNAMIC PARAMETERS ASSOCIATED WITH FLARES, WE WILL USE EXISTING OBSERVATIONS OF FLARING REGIONS WITH THE STOKES POLARIMETER ON HINODE. IN ADDITION, WE WILL USE EXISTING FLARE OBSERVATIONS WITH SOLIS FOR A FEW SELECTED FLARES AND CONDUCT NEW OBSERVATIONS IF NEEDED. AS A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT, SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL SOLIS OBSERVATIONAL FLARE CAMPAIGNS WERE CONDUCTED IN THE PAST. THE USE OF SOLIS DATA WILL ENHANCE THE INTERPRETATION OF SDO/HMI SPECTRAL DATA AS SOLIS/VSM HAS HIGHER SPECTRAL SAMPLING AS COMPARED WITH SDO/HMI DATA. CHANGES IN THERMODYNAMIC PARAMETERS WILL SHOW THE EFFECT OF FLARES THROUGH THE FORMATION HEIGHT RANGE OF THE FE I 630.1-630.2 NM PHOTOSPHERIC AND CA I 854.2 NM CHROMOSPHERIC SPECTRAL LINES. FINALLY, WE WILL COMPARE THE LOCATION OF FOOTPOINTS OF FLARE LOOPS DERIVED FROM RHESSI OBSERVATIONS IN AN ENERGY RANGE OF 50-300 KEV WITH THE LOCATIONS THAT SHOW SIGNIFICANT TOPOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE MAGNETIC FIELD. WE WILL EXAMINE THE RATE OF FLUX LOSS IN THE RECONNECTION EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH FLARES. WE EXPECT THAT THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY WILL BRING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF PHYSICS OF FLARE PROCESSES IN ACTIVE REGIONS AND CONSTRAIN SOME EXISTING FLARE MODELS."

THIS IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE HERSCHEL DEEP FIELDS FROM OTHER WAVELENGTHS.  THE PROJECT WILL USE EXISTING ALREADY-REDUCED DATA FROM HERSCHEL''S DEEPEST OBSERVATIONS, WHICH TARGETED THE CANDELS. THESE DATA HAVE A WEALTH OF OBSERVATIONS FROM HUBBLE, SPITZER, CHANDRA AND MANY OTHER TELESCOPES.  THE MAIN WORK WILL BE TO DEVELOP AND EMPLOY A NEW BAYESIAN TECHNIQUE THAT INCORPORATES SPECTRAL-ENERGY-DISTRIBUTION PRIORS TO CONSTRAIN THE RANGE OF LIKELY FAR-INFRARED  FLUXES FOR EACH SOURCE THAT IS DETECTED BY HUBBLE.  THE FAR-IR IMAGES ARE THEN SEGMENTED AND THE REGIONS WHICH ARE LIKELY TO SUFFER THE MOST CONFUSION ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY FIT, USING THE (BROAD) CONSTRAINTS ON THE LIKELY FAR-IR FLUXES AS A BAYESIAN PRIOR. THE FIRST PASS OF PHOTOMETRY WILL  YIELD RELIABLE PHOTOMETRY FOR SOURCES AT LEAST A FACTOR OF TWO FAINTER THAN EXISTING CATALOGS.

THE FORMER COULD POTENTIALLY BE EXPLAINED IF MANY OF THE DESCENDANTS OF UV-BRIGHT GALAXIES AT Z=4 HAVE TOO MUCH DUST BY Z=3 TO BE INCLUDED IN  LYMAN-BREAK SAMPLES. THE LATTER PROBLEM COULD BE RESOLVED IF THE FLUXES OF MANY FIR AND SUB-MM SELECTED GALAXIES ARE AFFECTED BY BLENDING.  THE PROJECT WILL EMPLOY STATE-OF-THE ART SEMI-ANALYTICAL MODELS FOR GALAXY EVOLUTION, BOTH FOR GUIDANCE IN DEVELOPING FLEXIBLE BAYESIAN PRIORS, AND FOR GUIDANCE ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS.

MAGNETIC FLUX SYNOPTIC CHARTS ARE CRITICAL FOR RELIABLE MODELING OF THE CORONA AND HELIOSPHERE. HOWEVER, CURRENT SYNOPTIC CHARTS HAVE SEVERAL LIMITATIONS. FIRST, THEY ARE PROVIDED WITHOUT ANY ESTIMATE OF UNCERTAINTIES. SECOND, THE SYNOPTIC MAPS ARE STILL CONSTRUCTED USING THE LINE-OF-SIGHT MAGNETOGRAMS UNDER A RESTRICTIVE ASSUMPTION THAT THE MAGNETIC FIELD IN THE PHOTOSPHERE IS VERTICAL. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP NEW DATA PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE UNCERTAINTY MAPS OF SYNOPTIC CHARTS, FULL VECTOR AND COMPOSITE MAPS (COMBINATION OF TRADITION SYNOPTIC MAPS AND FULL VECTOR FIELD MAPS), AND RADIAL FIELD SYNOPTIC MAPS OF CHROMOSPHERIC FIELD. THESE NEW SYNOPTIC MAP DATA PRODUCTS WILL ENABLE PROPER ESTIMATES OF UNCERTAINTIES, WHICH WILL IMPROVE THE MODELING OF SOLAR WIND SPEED, INTERPLANETARY MAGNETIC FIELD, SHAPE OF SOLAR CORONA, THE LOCATIONS OF SOURCE-SURFACE NEUTRAL LINES, THE BOUNDARIES OF CORONAL HOLES AND OTHER PARAMETERS OF HELIOPHYSICS SYSTEMS THAT RELY ON SYNOPTIC CHARTS FOR THEIR MODELING. THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS BASED ON MAGNETIC FIELD DATA FROM THE SDO/HMI, WHICH WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED BY THE OBSERVATIONS FROM A GROUND-BASED FACILITY (CHROMOSPHERIC MAGNETOGRAMS FROM SOLAR OPTICAL INVESTIGATIONS OF THE SUN, SOLIS FACILITY). MAGNETIC FIELD DATA TAKEN BY SOLIS/VSM IN CA II 854.2 NM CHROMOSPHERIC SPECTRAL LINE WILL PROVIDE A UNIQUE DATA PRODUCT CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FROM ANY NASA SPACECRAFT. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL BUILD ON RECENT EXPLORATORY WORK BY THE TEAM. WE DEVELOPED A CONCEPT FOR (SO CALLED) FIRST GENERATION ERROR (UNCERTAINTY) MAPS, IN WHICH UNCERTAINTIES ARE REPRESENTED BY SPATIAL VARIANCE OF THE MAGNETIC FLUX DISTRIBUTION THAT CONTRIBUTES TO EACH BIN IN THE SYNOPTIC CHART (BERTELLO ET AL., 2014). AS A SEPARATE DEVELOPMENT, WE ALSO EXPLORED THE CREATION OF FULL VECTOR FIELD SYNOPTIC MAPS (GOSAIN ET AL, 2013). THESE EARLY TESTS INDICATED ONE POSSIBLE DIFFICULTY IN CREATING THE VECTOR FIELD SYNOPTIC MAPS, I.E., A REDUCED SENSITIVITY OF VECTOR FIELD DATA IN QUIET SUN AREAS AND THE POLAR REGIONS. TO OVERCOME THIS LIMITATION, WE WILL DEVELOP THE COMPOSITE SYNOPTIC MAPS, WHICH COMBINE TRADITIONAL SYNOPTIC CHARTS FOR WEAK-FIELD AREAS WITH THE FULL VECTOR MAPS FOR AREAS OF STRONG MAGNETIC FIELD. THE USE OF COMPOSITE SYNOPTIC MAPS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE MODELING OF GLOBAL MAGNETIC FIELDS. FINALLY, WE WILL CREATE THE SYNOPTIC CHARTS OF (THE RADIAL COMPONENT OF) THE CHROMOSPHERIC MAGNETIC FIELD. DUE TO THE PREVALENCE OF FORCE-FREE FIELD CONDITIONS, THE CHROMOSPHERIC FIELDS ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE MUCH BETTER BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR THE EXTRAPOLATION MODELS. ONE DIFFICULTY THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE CREATION OF THESE MAPS IS THE DIVERGENCE OF MAGNETIC FIELD WITH HEIGHT AT THE CHROMOSPHERIC LEVEL, WHICH INVALIDATES THE ASSUMPTION OF VERTICALITY OF MAGNETIC FIELD UNDER WHICH THE PHOTOSPHERIC SYNOPTIC CHARTS ARE CONSTRUCTED. TO OVERCOME THAT DIFFICULTY, WE WILL EMPLOY THE MEAN CORRECTION FUNCTION DERIVED FROM THE OBSERVATIONS (JIN ET AL. 2013). ALL CODES DEVELOPED FOR THE CREATION OF THESE NEW DATA PRODUCTS WILL BE MADE PUBLIC BY PROVIDING THEM TO CCMC AND SDO/HMI TEAM. ALL DATA PRODUCTS WILL BE PUT INTO A PUBLIC DOMAIN VIA SDAC AND NSO DIGITAL LIBRARY."

WE WILL PURCHASE PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENTS THAT WILL BE PERMANENTLY LOANED TO THE HOST UNIVERSITIES, AND WE WILL TRAIN STUDENTS AT EACH UNIVERSITY THROUGH SEMESTER EMPLOYMENT WITH A LOCAL UNIVERSITY MENTOR, AND DURING A SUMMER INTERNSHIP. THE STUDENTS WILL LEARN TO COMPARE ECLIPSE DATA TO THE SPACE-BASED CORONAL DATA COLLECTED BY SEVERAL NASA HELIOPHYSICS MISSIONS LIKE SOHO/LASCO C2 AND SDO/AIA. THE STUDENTS WILL ALSO BE TRAINED TO USE THE TELESCOPES FOR NIGHT OBSERVATIONS FOR CITIZEN SCIENCE OBSERVATIONS OF COMETS.

HOWEVER, CURRENT TECHNIQUES TYPICALLY EMPLOY APPROXIMATE RADIATIVE TRANSFER METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS OF LOCAL THERMODYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM (LTE) TO RETRIEVE ABUNDANCES, LEADING TO UNCERTAINTIES OF ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE AND INCONCLUSIVE COMPARISONS TO CHEMICAL MODELS. ULTIMATELY, THE SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF THE HIGH QUALITY SPECTROSCOPIC DATA EXPECTED FROM THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE (JWST) WILL BE LIMITED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF RADIATIVE TRANSFER TOOLS FOR INFRARED MOLECULAR LINES. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A NUMERICALLY ACCURATE, NON-LTE 3D LINE RADIATIVE TRANSFER CODE, NEEDED TO INTERPRET MID-INFRARED MOLECULAR LINE OBSERVATIONS OF PROTOPLANETARY AND DEBRIS DISKS IN PREPARATION FOR THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE (JWST). THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY ADDING CRITICAL FUNCTIONALITY TO THE EXISTING MONTE CARLO CODE LIME, WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED TO SUPPORT (SUB)MILLIMETER INTERFEROMETRIC OBSERVATIONS. IN CONTRAST TO EXISTING INFRARED CODES, LIME CALCULATES THE EXACT STATISTICAL BALANCE OF ARBITRARY COLLECTIONS OF MOLECULAR LINES, AND DOES NOT USE LARGE VELOCITY GRADIENT (LVG) OR ESCAPE PROBABILITY APPROXIMATIONS. HOWEVER, TO USE LIME FOR INFRARED LINE RADIATIVE TRANSFER, NEW FUNCTIONALITY MUST BE ADDED AND TESTED, SUCH AS DUST SCATTERING, UV FLUORESCENCE, AND INTERFACES WITH PUBLIC STATE-OF-THE ART 3D DUST RADIATIVE TRANSFER CODES (E.G., RADMC3D) AND THERMO-CHEMICAL CODES (E.G, PRODIMO). INFRARED TRANSITIONS OF MOLECULES EXPECTED TO BE UBIQUITOUS IN JWST SPECTRA CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE GOOD DATABASES APPLICABLE TO ASTROPHYSICAL MODELING AND PROTOPLANETARY DISKS, INCLUDING WATER, OH, CO2, NH3, CH4, HCN, ETC. OBTAINING ACCURATE SOLUTIONS OF THE NON-LTE LINE TRANSFER PROBLEM IN 3D IN THE INFRARED IS COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE. WE PROPOSE TO BENCHMARK THE NEW CODE RELATIVE TO EXISTING, APPROXIMATE METHODS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY ARE ACCURATE, AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. WE WILL ALSO CREATE CONVERSION TABLES BETWEEN MID-INFRARED LINE STRENGTHS OF WATER, OH, CH4, NH3, CH3OH, CO2 AND OTHER SPECIES EXPECTED TO BE OBSERVED WITH JWST, AND THEIR RELATIVE ABUNDANCES IN PLANET-FORMING REGIONS. WE PROPOSE TO APPLY THE NEW IR-LIME TO RETRIEVE MOLECULAR ABUNDANCES FROM ARCHIVAL AND NEW SPECTROSCOPIC OBSERVATIONS WITH SPITZER/HERSCHEL/KECK/VLT OF CO, WATER, OH AND ORGANIC MOLECULES, AND TO PUBLISH COMPREHENSIVE TABLES OF RETRIEVED MOLECULAR ABUNDANCES IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS RELEVANT TO THE XRP CALL, SINCE IT ADDRESSES A CRITICAL STEP IN INFERRING THE CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES OF PLANET-FORMING MATERIAL, WHICH IN TURN CAN BE COMPARED TO THE OBSERVED COMPOSITIONS OF EXOPLANETS, THEREBY IMPROVING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ORIGINS OF EXOPLANETARY SYSTEMS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS PARTICULARLY TIMELY AS THE FIRST JWST SCIENCE DATA ARE EXPECTED TO BECOME AVAILABLE TOWARD THE END OF THE THREE-YEAR DURATION OF THE PROJECT."

THIS PROGRAM WILL CARRY OUT A DETAILED SPECTRAL ANALYSIS FOR SAMPLES OF BOTH FIELD M-DWARF STARS, ALONG WITH PLANET-HOSTING M-DWARFS UNCOVERED BY THE KEPLER MISSION, AND IN PARTICULAR THOSE HOSTING MULTIPLE SMALL PLANETS (EITHER EARTH-SIZE OR SUPER-EARTH SIZE).  HIGH-RESOLUTION NEAR-INFRARED SPECTRA WILL BE ANALYZED USING NEW MODEL ATMOSPHERES AND ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES PIONEERED HERE. THE FOCUS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS BOTH TO DERIVE ACCURATE STELLAR PARAMETERS AND METALLICITIES, AS WELL PIONEER THE STUDY OF DETAILED QUANTITATIVE CHEMICAL ANALYSES OF 15 KEY ELEMENTS IN COOL M-DWARFS THAT CANNOT BE OBTAINED FROM OPTICAL SPECTROSCOPY. THE KEPLER MISSION MDWARFS ARE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT IN BOTH TRANSIT AND RADIAL-VELOCITY SEARCHES FOR EXOPLANETS, THANKS TO THE ENHANCED DETECTABILITY OF SMALL PLANETS DUE TO THE LOW STELLAR MASSES OF M-DWARFS, THEIR LOW LUMINOSITIES, AND SMALL STELLAR RADII. IN ADDITION, M-DWARFS ARE THE MOST NUMEROUS STARS IN THE GALAXY. AS THE EXTENDED KEPLER MISSION (K2) UNCOVERS NEW M-DWARF PLANET-HOSTING STARS, THIS PROJECT WILL CONTINUE TO TARGET STRATEGIC SUBSETS OF NEWLY IDENTIFIED EXOPLANET-HOSTING M-DWARFS IN FUTURE YEARS. METHODOLOGY: OUR GROUP HAS DEVELOPED ACCURATE AND EFFICIENT TECHNIQUES FOR CHEMICALLY ANALYZING COOL RED GIANTS IN THE NEARINFRARED H-BAND (E.G., SMITH ET AL. 2013, APJ, 765, 16; CUNHA ET AL. 2015, APJL, 798, 41) AS A RESULT OF OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE SDSS III APOGEE AND SDSS IV APOGEE-2 (APACHE POINT OBSERVATORY GALACTIC EVOLUTION EXPERIMENT) SURVEYS. WE ARE CURRENTLY CONDUCTING AN ANCILLARY SCIENCE PROGRAM FOR APOGEE-2 TO TARGET ALL EXOPLANET-HOSTING M-DWARFS IN THE KEPLER FIELD AND WILL DEVELOP THE TECHNIQUES NECESSARY TO USE THE APOGEE ANALYSIS TOOLS TO INCLUDE M-DWARFS IN AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT MANNER. AS ADDITIONAL EXTENDED KEPLER MISSION (K2) M-DWARF HOSTS ARE UNCOVERED, WE WILL TARGET THESE IN THE FUTURE (APOGEE-2 RUNS THROUGH 2020). RELEVANCE TO EXOPLANET RESEARCH: THE PROPOSERS HERE HAVE THE EXPERTISE IN STELLAR ABUNDANCE ANALYSIS AND ARE WELL POSITIONED TO PROVIDE THE FIRST HIGH-RESOLUTION NIR SPECTROSCOPIC STELLAR PARAMETER AND ABUNDANCE ANALYSES OF CONFIRMED KEPLER M-DWARF SMALLPLANET SYSTEMS. POSSIBLE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN HOST-STAR CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS MASS OR CHEMICAL COMPOSITION, AND THE UNDERLYING NATURE OF DAUGHTER PLANETARY SYSTEMS, SUCH AS MASSES OR EVEN ORBITAL ARCHITECTURES, WILL BE EXTENDED TO THE REGIME OF THE M-DWARFS. LOW-RESOLUTION SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSES OF M-DWARFS CAN PROVIDE OVERALL ESTIMATES OF STELLAR PARAMETERS, BUT THESE CANNOT PROVIDE THE DETAILED CHEMICAL ABUNDANCE SIGNATURES WHICH CAN BE ANALYZED IN HIGH-RESOLUTION APOGEE SPECTRA, SUCH AS INDIVIDUAL C, N, O, NA, MG, AL, SI, S, K, CA, TI, MN, FE, OR NI ABUNDANCES, SOME OF WHICH PLAY FUNDAMENTAL ROLES IN PLANET FORMATION. THIS PROJECT OPENS A NEW WINDOW INTO A MAJOR CLASS OF STARS, WHOSE SIGNIFICANCE AS PLANET HOSTS WILL PLAY AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE FUTURE, SUCH AS REPRESENTING A LARGE FRACTION OF TARGETS FOR THE TESS MISSION."

THE MERIDIONAL FLOW PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN A BROAD RANGE OF SOLAR PHENOMENA FROM THE DYNAMO TO THE EVOLUTION OF POLAR MAGNETIC FIELDS AND THE PREDICTION OF THE SOLAR CYCLE. THE LATITUDINAL PROFILE OF THE MERIDIONAL FLOW IS A KEY INGREDIENT IN SURFACE FLUX-TRANSPORT MODELS AND GREATLY INFLUENCES THE POLAR FIELD EVOLUTION. THE MERIDIONAL FLOW IS THUS A CRUCIAL COMPONENT OF THE EVOLUTION OF SURFACE MAGNETIC FLUX. THE STRUCTURE AND THE STRENGTH OF THE MERIDIONAL FLOW SETS THE TIMING OF THE SOLAR CYCLE IN FLUX-TRANSPORT DYNAMO MODELS. THE MERIDIONAL FLOW AND ITS TEMPORAL VARIATION ARE THUS A CRUCIAL PART IN PREDICTING THE SOLAR CYCLE. WITH ITS COMPARABLY SMALL AMPLITUDE (ABOUT TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE SMALLER THAN THE SOLAR ROTATION RATE), THE MERIDIONAL FLOW IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO SYSTEMATICS AND ROBUST MEASUREMENTS ARE NOT EASILY AVAILABLE. WE PROPOSE TO CREATE A DATA PRODUCT THAT IS CORRECTED FOR SYSTEMATICS AND IS CONSISTENT DURING DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE SOLAR CYCLE. THE PROPOSED DATA PRODUCT CAN THUS BE USED AS INPUT DATA IN MODELING EFFORTS OR AS A BENCHMARK TO COMPARE MODEL PREDICTIONS AGAINST. MAKING THE CORRECTED SUBSURFACE MERIDIONAL FLOW AVAILABLE AS A DATA RESOURCE TO THE HELIOPHYSICS COMMUNITY WILL GREATLY ENHANCE THE SCIENTIFIC RETURN FROM SDO/HMI AND WILL BE CRUCIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING THE POLEWARD TRANSPORT OF MAGNETIC ACTIVITY AND PREDICTING THE SOLAR CYCLE. METHODOLOGY: WE WILL PRODUCE THE FOLLOWING DATA PRODUCT: THE MERIDIONAL FLOW AT SEVERAL DEPTHS IN THE SUBSURFACE LAYERS AS A FUNCTION OF LATITUDE AND TIME. THE INPUT MEASUREMENTS ARE THE SUBSURFACE FLOWS DERIVED FROM SDO/HMI DOPPLERGRAMS ANALYZED WITH THE RING-DIAGRAM TECHNIQUE FROM THE SURFACE TO A DEPTH OF 16 MM. FROM THE DAILY FULL-DISK FLOW MAPS (INPUT DATA), WE WILL CALCULATE THE AVERAGE MERIDIONAL FLOW (PROPOSED DATA PRODUCT) AVERAGED OVER EACH COMPLETE CARRINGTON ROTATION. WE WILL REMOVE SYSTEMATIC EFFECTS PRESENT IN THE SUBSURFACE FLOW MEASUREMENTS, SUCH AS SYSTEMATIC VARIATIONS WITH DISK POSITION AND ANNUAL VARIATIONS DUE TO THE B0 AND P ANGLE, AND AVERAGE THE CORRECTED FLOWS OVER EACH CARRINGTON ROTATION. THEN, WE WILL USE SOHO/MDI AND GONG DATA TO GENERATE THE CORRECTED MERIDIONAL FLOW FOR SOLAR CYCLE 23 IN ADDITION TO CYCLE 24 COVERED BY SDO/HMI DATA. WE HAVE ALREADY TESTED OUR METHOD ON EXISTING (ARCHIVED) SUBSURFACE FLOW DATA AND PLAN TO CREATE THESE DATASETS FIRST INCLUDING THEIR CALIBRATION AND DOCUMENTATION. WE WILL THEN CREATE NEW DATA PRODUCTS AS SOON AS A FULL CARRINGTON ROTATIONS OF SUBSURFACE FLOW MEASUREMENTS BECOME AVAILABLE FROM SDO/HMI (VIA JSOC) AND WILL ADD THEM TO THE DATA SET. IN THIS WAY, WE WILL CREATE A DATASET THAT CAN BE USED FOR STUDIES OF THE SOLAR CYCLE AS WELL AS FOR MODELING LATITUDINAL FLUX TRANSPORT OF THE CURRENT SUN."

THIS ONE METER TELESCOPE WILL CREATE A MONUMENTAL CHANGE IN FAINT NEA OBSERVATIONS, BECOMING THE LARGEST FULL TIME NEOO TELESCOPE IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE DEDICATED TO THE RECOVERY OF V23.0-24.0 MAGNITUDE NEOS. UTILIZING THIS ONE METER TELESCOPE FOR V23RD NEA RECOVERY WILL PROVIDE LONGER ORBITAL ARCS ON NEWLY DISCOVERED ASTEROIDS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO RECOVER V23RD MAGNITUDE SINGLE OPPOSITION NEAS. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL: 1) PRODUCE 2,000, V23RD MAGNITUDE MEASURES PER YEAR DURING DARK TIME AND, 2) PROVIDE A LARGE APERTURE TELESCOPE TO RECOVER FAINT NEOCP OBJECTS AND NEWLY DISCOVERED NEAS DURING FULL MOON. NEA FOLLOW-UP IS CRITICAL TO THE REDUCTION OF ORBITAL UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE FOLLOW-UP TELESCOPES UTILIZING BOTH NON-SIDEREAL TRACKING AND VECTOR CO-ADDING TECHNIQUES CAN OBSERVE ASTEROIDS MUCH FAINTER THAN THE DISCOVERY TELESCOPES IN DRIFT SCAN. THE ASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE HAS PERFECTED THIS TECHNIQUE ALLOWING 0.61-M TELESCOPES AT CTIO TO OBSERVE ASTEROIDS AS FAINT AS V23.0 WITH A 30 MINUTE VECTOR CO-ADDED IMAGE. THIS SAME TECHNIQUE WILL ALLOW CTIO S 1.0-M TO OBSERVE ASTEROIDS AS FAINT AS V24.0. APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY: CTIO S ONE METER CASSEGRAIN REFLECTOR BUILT BY BOLLER AND CHIVENS IN 1965 HAS BEEN OPERATIONAL AT CTIO SINCE 1974. THE TELESCOPE WILL BE AUTOMATED USING DAN GRAY S SIDEREAL TECHNOLOGIES HARDWARE AND WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE SKYNET REMOTELY OPERATED TELESCOPE NETWORK. CTIO S ONE METER TELESCOPE WILL BE CONTROLLED ALONGSIDE THE EXISTING NASA FUNDED PROMPT TELESCOPES ALLOWING A SINGLE OPERATOR TO MANAGE ALL OPERATIONS. THIS OBSERVING METHOD IS THE MOST COST EFFICIENT BECAUSE THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ASTEROID TARGETING, DATA REDUCTION, AND DATA TRANSFER ARE ALREADY FULLY AUTOMATED. UTILIZING A SINGLE TELESCOPE OPERATOR TO HANDLE ALL OF SSNEO S OPERATIONS MAXIMIZES THESE ASSETS PREVENTING DUPLICATION OF OBSERVATIONS AS WELL AS BETTER CONTROL OF THE TELESCOPE SYSTEM RELATIVE TO WEATHER PATTERNS. CTIO S 1.0-M TELESCOPE WILL CONCENTRATE ALL DARK OBSERVING TIME TO RECOVERY OF V23.0-24.0 MAGNITUDE NEOS AND NEAR FULL MOON WILL ASSIST IN FAINT NEOCP AND NEWLY DISCOVERED OBJECTS TO PREVENT THOSE NEAS FROM BECOMING LOST. SIGNIFICANCE OF PROPOSED WORK: AT THE FIRST AND SECOND IAWN COMMITTEE MEETING, T. SPAHR REPORTED THAT DEDICATED GROUND BASED TELESCOPE FOLLOW-UP TO #tilde#V24 WAS NEEDED, ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE. THE CTIO 1.0-M TELESCOPE WILL BE THE FIRST TELESCOPE TO PROVIDE THAT CAPABILITY ON A FULLTIME BASIS. CURRENTLY THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII 2.24-M TELESCOPE OPERATED BY D. THOLEN HAS PROVIDED THE MAJORITY OF FOLLOW-UP AND RECOVERY OBSERVATIONS FAINTER THAN V23.0. HOWEVER, ONLY A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME EACH YEAR IS DEDICATED TO THOSE OBSERVATIONS. FROM 2015 OCTOBER 1ST THROUGH 2016 MARCH 1ST THERE WERE 4,540 MEASURES FAINTER THAN 22ND MAGNITUDE REPORTED TO THE MINOR PLANET CENTER AND ONLY 476 FAINTER THAN V23.0. CTIO S 1.0-M TELESCOPE WILL PRODUCE #tilde#2,000, V23.0-V24.0 MEASURES PER YEAR RESULTING IN A 300% INCREASE IN THESE FAINT NEO OBSERVATIONS."

SCIENTIFIC: THE SOUTHERN SKY NEAR EARTH OBSERVATIONS (SSNEO) BEGAN APRIL 1ST, 2012 AND HAS SINCE PROVIDED OVER 80% OF ALL NEA MEASURES BELOW MINUS 20 DECLINATION. THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE REMAINS A CRITICAL AREA FOR NEA FOLLOW-UP TO PREVENT MANY ASTEROIDS FROM BEING LOST BY EXTENDING THEIR ORBITAL ARCS. WITH THE INCREASE IN NEA DISCOVERIES FROM PANSTARRS AND THE CATALINA SKY SURVEY (CSS) THE NUMBER OF NEAR-EARTH OBJECT CONFIRMATION PAGE (NEOCP) NEAS IN NEED OF ASTROMETRY HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER. THEREFORE, SSNEO IN PHASE 3 WILL DEDICATE THEIR EFFORTS TO PROVIDE AN EFFICIENT NEA ASTROMETRY AND RECOVERY PROGRAM. PANSTARRS AND CSS ARE CURRENTLY EXPENDING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF TIME CONDUCTING FOLLOW-UP OF THEIR OWN DISCOVERIES LIMITING THEIR ABILITY TO SEARCH FOR NEW NEAR-EARTH ASTEROIDS. IN PHASE 3 SSNEO WILL DECREASE THE NEED FOR SURVEYS TO FOLLOW-UP THEIR SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE TARGETS BY 25%. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY UTILIZING NEW HARDWARE AND A SCHEDULING SYSTEM WHICH WILL OBTAIN EPHEMERIS AND UNCERTAINTY INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM JPL S NEASCOUT WEBSITE. TECHNICAL: IN 2015, SSNEO EXPANDED THEIR PROJECT FROM ONE 0.41-M TELESCOPE TO TWO 0.61-M TELESCOPES AND ONE 0.41-M INSTRUMENT INCREASING THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE FOLLOW-UP OF NEOS TO MAGNITUDE V23.0. THIS PROPOSAL WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE THREE TELESCOPES AND WILL REQUEST FUNDS TO UPGRADE THE REMAINING 0.41-M TELESCOPE TO A 0.61-M INSTRUMENT. WITH THIS UPGRADE ALL THREE TELESCOPES WILL BE IDENTICAL WITH THE SAME IMAGE SCALE AND 23.9 ARC-MINUTE FIELD OF VIEW. SINGLE OPPOSITION NEAS TYPICALLY HAVE AN UNCERTAINTY WHICH IS LINEAR WITHIN A RANGE OF RIGHT ASCENSION AND DECLINATION. TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF RECOVERIES THE THREE TELESCOPES WILL HAVE A NEW FEATURE WHERE EACH TELESCOPE S CAMERA ROTATOR WILL AUTOMATICALLY ORIENT ITS POSITION SO THAT THE SKY ANGLE OF UNCERTAINTY ALIGNS WITH THE CCD S ARRAY DIAGONALLY. BECAUSE EACH TELESCOPE HAS A DIAGONAL IMAGE THAT IS 33.8 ARC-MINUTES, ALL THREE TELESCOPES TOGETHER CAN COVER 5,100 ARC-SECONDS OF UNCERTAINTY WORKING TOGETHER. THIS ADDITIONAL FEATURE IN TELESCOPE AUTOMATION TAKES ADVANTAGE OF EACH TELESCOPE''S IDENTICAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, A 3 SQUARE DEGREE UNCERTAINTY REGION CAN BE EASILY SEARCHED IN A SINGLE NIGHT. THE JPL NEASCOUT WEBSITE IS A NEW ASSET THAT WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO DAILY OPERATIONS. USING NEASCOUT BOTH NEOCP AND NEA S EPHEMERIS AND UNCERTAINTY OF AN OBJECT CAN BE DIRECTLY LINKED INTO SSNEO S AUTOMATION ROUTINES. THIS WILL ALLOW CALCULATIONS OF THE FIELDS TO BE TARGETED SO THE UNCERTAINTY AREA CAN BE EASILY SEARCHED. MANAGEMENT: FOLLOW-UP OBSERVATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE ASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE S SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE CONTROL OFFICE. ARI HAS SIX YEARS OF EXPERIENCE CONTROLLING TELESCOPES AT CTIO REMOTELY. THIS GRANT WILL CONTINUE TO BE MANAGED BY PI ROBERT HOLMES AND CO-I TYLER LINDER. CO-I LINDER WILL MANAGE THE DAILY OPERATIONS AND OVERSEE PROPER AUTOMATION ROUTINES PROVIDING IMPORTANT SUPPORT TO PANSTARRS AND CSS DISCOVERIES AS WELL AS EXTENDING THE ORBITAL ARCS ON AS MANY SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE TARGETS AS POSSIBLE."

OUR GOAL IN CONTINUING THIS RESEARCH IS  TO PROVIDE A DEDICATED COST EFFECTIVE NEO FOLLOW UP PROGRAM THAT WILL ALLOW NASA TO COMPLETE THEIR GOAL OF CATALOGING POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS NEAR EARTH OBJECTS TO 100 METERS.ARI HAS BEEN AN INTEGRAL PART OF NASAS NEOO PROGRAM FOR THE PAST NINE YEARS. UTILIZING FOUR TELESCOPES LOCATED AT THE INSTITUTE, OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO PROVIDE THE LONGEST POSSIBLE ORBITAL ELEMENTS SPECIFICALLY FOR OBJECTS FAINTER THAN MAGNITUDE 22.0.

OUR SECONDARY GOAL IN THIS RESEARCH WILL BE TO CONDUCT FOLLOW UP OBSERVATIONS OF FIRST OPPOSITION NEOS AND THOSE REQUIRING ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS AS SPECIFIED BY THE MINOR PLANET CENTER MPC. ARIS LOWEST PRIORITY IN PHASE IV WILL BE TARGETED FOLLOW UP OF MULTIOPPOSITION OBJECTS.AS THE LARGE SKY SURVEYS SUCH AS PANSTARRS AND THE MT. LEMMON SURVEY CONTINUE TO MAKE NEW DISCOVERIES OF OBJECTS FAINTER THAN 22ND MAGNITUDE, THE NEED FOR FAINT FOLLOW UP BECOMES MORE IMPERATIVE. DURING PHASE IV, ARI PLANS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS ON NEAS BRIGHTER THAN 22ND MAGNITUDE DUE TO THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE OBSERVERS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON THESE NEOS. IN 2015, ONLY SIX OBSERVATORIES REPORTED MORE THAN 250, 22ND MAGNITUDE MEASURES OF NEOS TO THE MPC. OF THESE SIX, ARI WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR 47.5 OF ALL THE OBSERVATIONS THAT WERE FAINTER THAN MAGNITUDE 22.0. IN 2015, H21 CONFIRMED 513 NEOS FOR THE SKY SURVEY DISCOVERY TEAMS AND RECOVERED TWENTY FIVE 22ND MAGNITUDE FIRST OPPOSITION OBJECTS. THREE OF THE FOUR INSTRUMENTS CURRENTLY IN OPERATION AT THE INSTITUTE ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF 22ND MAGNITUDE NEO OBSERVATIONS AND THE 1.3 M TELESCOPE IS CAPABLE OF RECOVERING 23RD MAGNITUDE NEOS. SHORTLY AFTER COMMISSIONING THE 1.3 M TELESCOPE IN SEPTEMBER 2014, NEO 2010 SV3 WAS RECOVERED AT UNFILTERED MAGNITUDE 24.2 WITH THREE MEASURES. THREE WEEKS LATER IT WAS CONFIRMED A SECOND TIME WITH THREE ADDITIONAL MEASURES. DURING THIS TELESCOPES FIRST 18 MONTHS OF OPERATION MORE THAN 105, 23RD MAGNITUDE NEOS HAVE BEEN MEASURED.SIGNIFICANCE OF PROPOSED WORKOBSERVATIONS IN PHASE IV WILL BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN ONLY A FEW FOLLOW UP FACILITIES ARE AVAILABLE DUE TO THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S. ANNUAL MONSOON SEASON. IN 2015 THE INSTITUTE AT WESTFIELD, ILLINOIS WORKED 63 NIGHTS DURING THE SUMMER PRODUCING 10,202 NEO MEASURES AND CONFIRMING 170 NEWLY DISCOVERED OBJECTS FOR THE DISCOVERY TEAMS.

WHILE SOFTWARE CAN HELP, WHAT IS REALLY NEEDED IS ADDITIONAL EYES, HANDS, AND MINDS. THESE ADDITIONAL PEOPLE ARE ALL AROUND US; THEY ARE OUR NEIGHBORS, OUR CHILDREN, AND THE PERSON IN FRONT OF US IN THE GROCERY STORE. THE COSMOQUEST VIRTUAL RESEARCH FACILITY HAS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH PUBLISHED RESEARCH RESULTS THAT CLASSROOM STUDENTS AND THE PUBLIC CAN, WITH PROPER TRAINING AND SUPPORT FROM SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS (SMES), FILL ROLES MORE TRADITIONALLY FILLED BY UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. WITH THIS PROPOSAL, WE SEEK A COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT TO PRODUCE A REGULAR SERIES OF CITIZEN SCIENCE PORTALS THAT SUPPORT SMD SCIENCE AND ENABLE STEM EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AND THE PUBLIC THROUGH ACTIVITIES THAT SUPPORT THE COSTEM NATIONAL EDUCATION GOALS [1]. THIS PROJECT IS LED BY DR. PAMELA L. GAY (ASP), AND INVOLVES AN INTERDISCIPLINARY CONSORTIUM OF INSTITUTES, LEVERAGING OUR EFFORTS THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS ACROSS A RANGE OF EXPERTISE AND GEOGRAPHY. THE RESEARCH QUESTION BEHIND COSMOQUEST S CREATION WAS SIMPLE: IF STUDENTS AND THE PUBLIC ARE PROVIDED A PROPERLY SCAFFOLDED EXPERIENCE THAT MIRRORS THAT OF RESEARCHERS, WILL THEY COME? AND CAN THEY RISE UP TO BE RESEARCH COLLABORATORS? IN CREATING COSMOQUEST, WE STARTED WITH A CORE OF CITIZEN SCIENCE PORTALS, EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS FOR BOTH STUDENTS AND LIFELONG LEARNERS, AND COLLABORATION AREAS. THESE THREE PRIMARY FOCUSES MIRROR THE RESEARCH, COURSES, AND COLLABORATION SPACES THAT FORM THE FOUNDATION OF A UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENT. WE THEN WENT ON TO ADD THE FEATURES THAT MAKE A CENTER STANDOUT   WE ADDED SEMINARS IN THE FORM OF GOOGLE HANGOUTS ON AIR, PLANETARIUM CONTENT THROUGH OUR SCIENCE ON THE HALF SPHERE PROGRAM, AND EVEN THE CHANCE TO VICARIOUSLY ATTEND CONFERENCES THROUGH LIVE BLOGGING BY OUR TEAM MEMBERS. WITH THIS DESIGN FOR A VIRTUAL RESEARCH FACILITY, THE ANSWER TO OUR FOUNDATIONAL QUESTION HAS BEEN A RESOUNDING YES; THE PUBLIC CAN AID US IN DOING SCIENCE, WHILE WE ALSO IMPROVE U.S. SCIENTIFIC LITERACY."

IN ORDER TO DISCERN HOW THESE FEATURES AROSE, WE MUST FIRST UNRAVEL THE EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE EARLIEST ANIMAL GROUPS AND IDENTIFY GENETIC MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING ADVANCED SYSTEMS SUCH AS NERVOUS AND MUSCULE TISSUE. A CANDIDATE GENE APPROACH HAS PROVIDED RESEARCHERS SOME INSIGHT AS TO IMPORTANT GENES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN INITIALLY IMPORTANT IN SHAPING NERVOUS AND MUSCULAR SYSTEMS, BUT OUR KNOWLEDGE IS LIMITED TO A FEW MODEL ANIMALS SPECIES.

THE FLOW PERTURBATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH STRONG FIELD-ALIGNED CURRENTS THAT COMMUNICATE THE MAGNETIC STRESSES TO THE IONOSPHERE AS ALFVEN WAVES, WHICH CAN COUPLE TO KINETIC SCALES LEADING TO FLOW BRAKING AND PARTICLE HEATING. A GROWING NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF KINETIC SCALE ALFVEN WAVES ON THE PLASMA SHEET-IONOSPHERE COUPLING. ALTHOUGH FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT, THE GENERATION, STRUCTURE, AND ROLE OF ALFVEN MODE WAVES IN THE TAIL ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. THE WAVE PROCESSES MAY TAKE PLACE IN REGIONS OF FAST FLOWS, FLOW BRAKING, AND THE DIPOLE-LIKE FIELD. GIVEN THE MULTI-SCALE AND NONLINEAR NATURE OF THE PROBLEM, COMPUTER SIMULATIONS THAT CAN DESCRIBE SCALES RANGING FROM GLOBAL DRIVERS TO THE ION GYRORADIUS GUIDED BY MULTIPOINT OBSERVATIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO REACH A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE COUPLING PROCESSES. THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED STUDY IS TO UNDERSTAND THE GENERATION AND DYNAMICS OF ALFVEN WAVES/KINETIC ALFVEN WAVES (KAWS) ASSOCIATED WITH THE TAIL FAST FLOWS IN THE SELF-CONSISTENT SOLAR WIND-MAGNETOSPHERE-IONOSPHERE COUPLING BY COMPARING OBSERVATIONS WITH GLOBAL HYBRID SIMULATIONS.THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC SCIENCE QUESTIONS: (1) WHAT ARE THE ROLES OF MAGNETIC RECONNECTION, COMPRESSIONAL WAVES, AND THE DIPOLE-LIKE FIELD IN THE GENERATION OF ALFVEN WAVES AND KAWS AND ARE THEY TYPICALLY OBSERVED AND GENERATED IN ASSOCIATION WITH MAGNETOTAIL FAST FLOWS? (2) HOW DO ALFVEN WAVE GENERATION, EVOLUTION, AND GLOBAL STRUCTURE DEPEND ON IMF CONDITIONS AND SOLAR WIND MACH NUMBERS? (3) WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTIC SPECTRA, GLOBAL DISTRIBUTIONS, POYNTING FLUX, AND FIELD ALIGNED CURRENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ALFVEN MODE WAVES IN THE NEAR-TAIL, AND WHAT DO THESE PROPERTIES IMPLY FOR ION HEATING AND ACCELERATION?METHODOLOGY: THE ABOVE SCIENCE QUESTIONS WILL BE ANSWERED USING DATA FROM THE THEMIS SPACECRAFT AND OMNI DATA SETS TOGETHER WITH NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS BASED ON A THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3-D) GLOBAL HYBRID MODEL. THE PRIMARY NUMERICAL METHODOLOGY IS THROUGH SIMULATIONS USING THE AUBURN 3-D GLOBAL HYBRID CODE THAT INCLUDES BOTH THE DAYSIDE AND NIGHT SIDE MAGNETOSPHERE UNDER VARIOUS SOLAR WIND CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH STORM/SUBSTORM. THE SIMULATION DOMAIN EXTENDS FROM THE SOLAR WIND AT GSM X=+20RE TO X=-60RE IN THE TAIL, WHICH ALLOWS US TO CONSIDER THE SOLAR WIND CONTROL OF TAIL DYNAMICS. THIS MODEL IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE PROPOSED SIMULATIONS AND CAN DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PROCESSES THAT COUPLE ENERGY FROM GLOBAL SCALE DRIVERS OF ALFVEN WAVES TO ION KINETIC SCALES. THE SIMULATION STUDY WILL BE COORDINATED WITH SATELLITE DATA ANALYSIS OF THE THEMIS MISSION AND OMNI DATA SETS. DATA FROM THE THEMIS MISSION IS AVAILABLE THROUGH A WEB INTERFACE AND COLLABORATION WITH MEMBERS OF THE THEMIS SCIENCE TEAM. OMNI IS AN OPEN DATA SET PROVIDED AT HTTP:// OMNIWEB.GSFC.NASA.GOV/FORM/OMNI_MIN.HTML. DATA AND RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS WILL BE PUBLISHED IN REFEREED JOURNALS.RELEVANCE TO NASA: THE PROPOSED TOPICS FIT IN THE BROAD CATEGORIES OF MAGNETOSPHERE UNDER THE NASA HELIOPHYSICS SUPPORTING RESEARCH PROGRAM (SOLICITATION NNH16ZDA001N-HSR), MOST RELEVANT TO THE SCIENCE AREA NO. 10, MAGNETOSPHERE-IONOSPHERE COUPLING/MAGNETOTAIL, BUT ALSO TOUCH NO. 8, SOLAR WIND-MAGNETOSPHERE COUPLING. THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATIONS ARE OF HIGH PRIORITY BECAUSE THEY COMBINE USE OF DATA FROM CURRENT NASA SPACECRAFT (THEMIS SPACECRAFT AND OMNI DATA SETS) TOGETHER WITH THEORY AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION (3-D GLOBAL HYBRID MODEL) TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC HELIOPHYSICS DECADAL SURVEY GOAL NO. 2.

OUR INNOVATIVE APPROACH IS TO COMBINE THE RETROSPECTIVE METHOD (USE HISTORICAL TMIS AND DELAYS ON SIMILAR DAYS FOR NEXT-DAY PREDICTION) WITH THE PREDICTIVE METHOD (USE FAST-TIME SIMULATION OF NEXT-DAY S WEATHER, TMIS AND RESULTING DELAYS, BASED ON THE TRANSLATED WEATHER FORECAST) INTO A SEAMLESS ENSEMBLE. UNTIL NOW, ONLY THE FIRST PART   HISTORICAL ANALYSIS   WAS USED FOR SUCH PREDICTIONS, AND EVEN THEN MOSTLY SHORT-RANGE. HOWEVER, AVMET HAS DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED A POWERFUL WEATHER-AWARE, SUPERFAST-TIME NAS SIMULATOR, DART, WHICH CAN REPRODUCE HISTORICALLY OBSERVED OUTCOMES OF A WIDE RANGE OF WEATHER-IMPACTED DAYS WITH A GOOD DEGREE OF ACCURACY AND PROCESS A COMPLEX DAY OF NAS OPERATIONS IN JUST OVER A MINUTE. OUR TECHNOLOGY ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AUTOMATE AND ACCELERATE SIMILAR-WEATHER SEARCHES. THIS OPENS THE DOOR TO AN ENSEMBLE APPROACH WHERE BOTH HISTORICAL AND SIMULATION-DRIVEN FORECASTING METHODS ARE COMBINED FOR NEXT-DAY DELAY PREDICTION AND TMI RECOMMENDATIONS. THE METHODOLOGY WILL BE DESIGNED AS A FULLY AUTOMATED TOOLCHAIN TO WORK YEAR-ROUND, PROCESSING CONVECTIVE AS WELL AS NON-CONVECTIVE (CEILINGS, WINTER WEATHER, WIND, ETC.) WEATHER IMPACTS. IT WILL USE A NUMBER OF INNOVATIVE WEATHER FORECAST TRANSLATION, TMI SIMULATION, AND ENSEMBLING TECHNIQUES. IT WILL ALSO USE NEW AND CREATIVE RANDOMIZATION METHODS TO GENERATE A RANGE OF POTENTIAL SCENARIOS BASED ON NEXT-DAY WEATHER FORECAST. WE BELIEVE THAT, BY TUNING THE BLEND OF RETROSPECTIVE AND PREDICTIVE ENSEMBLE METHODS, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THEIR STRENGTHS AND MITIGATE THEIR SHORTCOMINGS, AND DEMONSTRATE NOTICEABLY BETTER PREDICTIVE ACCURACY OF THIS AMALGAMATED ENSEMBLE VS. HISTORICAL-ONLY OR SIMULATED-ONLY METHODS."

UTILIZATION OF A FREQUENCY COMB REFERENCE ALLOWS COHERENT DETECTION AND DIGITIZATION OF THE OPTICAL FIELD WITHIN THE FULL SPECTRUM OF THE FREQUENCY COMB. THE BROADBAND, COHERENT NATURE OF THE FREQUENCY COMB ALLOWS NARROW FREQUENCY CHANNELS TO BE DOWN-CONVERTED TO AND MEASURED AT RF FREQUENCIES, AND COHERENTLY ADDED IN THE DIGITAL DOMAIN -- RESULTING IN AN SNR THAT IS COMPARABLE TO THAT OF TRADITIONAL DIRECT DETECTION INTERFEROMETERS, BUT WITHOUT THE NEED FOR NANOMETER SCALE OPTICAL PATH LENGTH CONTROL FOR BEAM COMBINATION PURPOSES OR THE TERABIT/SEC DATA RATES NECESSARY FOR SAMPLING THE OPTICAL FIELD DIRECTLY. SPECTRAL SENSITIVITY OF THE SYSTEM ALLOWS RADIAL VELOCIMETRY MEASUREMENTS SENSITIVE TO REDSHIFT ON THE ORDER OF SEVERAL HZ, WHICH IS SUFFICIENT TO RESOLVE RELATIVE VELOCITY CHANGE ON THE ORDER OF MM/SEC. DIRECT SPECTROSCOPIC MEASUREMENTS WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL BE SENSITIVE ENOUGH TO DETECT THE PRESENCE WATER, METHANE, AND OTHER COMPOUNDS WITH ABSORPTION FEATURES WITHIN THE FREQUENCY COMB SPECTRUM.

THE LOCAL CONTROL IS BASED UPON AN ARCHITECTURE KNOWN AS MODEL PREDICTIVE CONTROL (MPC).  MPC HAS FOUND USE IN MANY DIFFERENT COMPLEX SYSTEMS WHERE THE CONTROLLED SYSTEM IS CHARACTERIZED AS MULTIVARIABLE, WITH MULTIPLE CONSTRAINTS AND POSSIBLY NONLINEAR.  THESE INCLUDE ROBOTIC VISION SYSTEMS, CHEMICAL PROCESSING AND HAS BEEN PROPOSED FOR QUAD-ROTOR AND FORMATION FLYING SPACECRAFT.  MPC OPTIMIZES THE DATA COLLECTION AT EACH TIME STEP FROM HIGHER LEVEL CONSTRAINTS AND COMMANDS AND IS ENABLED BY THE INCREASED COMPUTATIONAL POWER NOW AVAILABLE IN FPGA IMPLEMENTATIONS.  WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP THE MPC ARCHITECTURE FOR ESFL AND USE MODELS TO VERIFY IT S CAPABILITY FROM SYNTHETIC SCENES AND FUSION WITH OTHER SENSORS.  ESFL HAS POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUALLY STEERABLE LASER BEAMLETS AND WHEN COMBINED WITH OTHER SENSOR POSES A LARGE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM WELL SUITED TO THE MPC APPROACH.  THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED UNDER THIS EFFORT IS APPLICABLE TO FORMATION FLYING SYSTEMS ALSO."

THE TRANSDISCIPLINARY BATTELLE TEAM IS ESPECIALLY QUALIFIED TO MANAGE AND IMPLEMENT THIS WORK IN A COST EFFECTIVE AND TECHNICALLY INNOVATIVE WAY. ENERGY SYSTEMS ARE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, WITH ELECTRICITY SERVING SOCIETY FROM COOKING AND LIGHTING TO COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORTATION. HOWEVER, IMPACTS FROM CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND CHANGE, SUCH AS EXTREME WEATHER OR SEA LEVEL RISE, THREATEN ENERGY RELIABILITY AND COMMUNITY RESILIENCE. HOWEVER, VULNERABILITIES AND NEEDS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR VARY WIDELY BY COMPONENT, REGION, AND GEOGRAPHY. A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY FOR ADDRESSING RESILIENCE PLANNING AND UPTAKE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY MUST INCLUDE ENGAGEMENT WITH UTILITY PROVIDERS WHO CAN BUILD SUCH ACTIONS INTO ROUTINE PLANNING AND MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES. FINDINGS FROM THE 2016 ENERGY MANAGEMENT WORKSHOP SUGGEST THAT THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN EARTH SCIENCE RESEARCHERS AND UTILITY END USERS MUST BE STRENGTHENED FOR NEW PRODUCTS, TOOLS, AND DATA PACKAGES TO MEET UTILITY USER NEEDS. THE BATTELLE TEAM WILL ENGAGE THE EARTH SCIENCE COMMUNITY, UTILITY END USERS, AND OTHER GOVERNMENT OR RESEARCH STAKEHOLDERS IN STRENGTHENING THE ABILITY OF UTILITY END USERS TO ACCESS AND USE EO DATA. THE PROPOSED APPROACH UTILIZES A CAPACITY BUILDING FRAMEWORK TO CONDUCT A THOROUGH NEEDS ASSESSMENT, UTILIZING THE UTILITY PARTNERSHIP AS A KEY ENTRY POINT TO ENGAGING WITH THE END USER COMMUNITY. AN ADVISORY GROUP OF TECHNICAL EXPERTS AND FEDERAL AGENCY REPRESENTATIVES WILL ALSO BE FORMED TO MAXIMIZE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT WILL SEEK TO QUANTIFY TECHNICAL CAPACITY AND GAPS, CURRENT EO DATA USAGE, AND ASPIRATIONAL GOALS ON POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM APPLICATION AREAS FOR EO UPTAKE. BASED ON THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT FINDINGS, A SERIES OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CAPACITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES WILL BE DEVELOPED. PRELIMINARY TRAINING TOPICS MAY INCLUDE SATELLITE DATA TYPES AND CURRENT APPLICATIONS FOR UTILITY APPLICATIONS; DATA PROCESSING, FORMATTING, AND VISUALIZATION FOR UTILITY APPLICATIONS; OR INCORPORATING EO DATA AND TOOLS INTO RESILIENCE PLANNING OR RENEWABLE ENERGY UPTAKE (ASSESSMENT, MONITORING, ETC.) FOR UTILITY APPLICATIONS. CASE STUDIES ON CURRENT AND ASPIRATIONAL EO APPLICATIONS OR EXISTING TOOLS AND PRODUCTS WILL BE DEVELOPED USING INFOGRAPHICS AND/ OR ESRI STORY MAPS AND DISTRIBUTED THROUGH TARGETED LISTSERVS AND SOCIAL MEDIA. A PRELIMINARY CASE STUDY TOPIC MAY INCLUDE USING NORMALIZED DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX (NDVI) FROM VIIRS AND MODIS, PRECIPITATION DATA FROM GPM AND SOIL MOISTURE DATA FROM SMAP DATA TO UNDERSTAND FLOOD RISK. THE BATTELLE TEAM WILL ALSO ENGAGE WITH THE EARTH SCIENCE COMMUNITY VIA PARTICIPATION IN TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND THROUGH THE DISTRIBUTION OF UTILITY DATA NEEDS VIA PUBLICATION IN KEY SCIENTIFIC AND POPULAR JOURNALS. GREATER INFORMATION SHARING NETWORKS ARE AN IMPORTANT STEP IN PROVIDING AND STRENGTHENING LINKAGES BETWEEN DATA PROVIDERS AND DATA USERS. THE PROPOSED WORK MEETS THE GROUP ON EARTH OBSERVATIONS  (GEO) STATED NEED TO IMPROVE THE AVAILABILITY, ACCESS, AND USE OF EOS TO INFORM DECISIONS AND BENEFIT SOCIETY. THE ATTENTION PAID TO SUSTAINED STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT, ONGOING EVALUATION, AND INFORMATION SHARING WITH BOTH SCIENTIFIC AND END-USER COMMUNITIES ALSO SUPPORTS GEO VISION FOR ENERGY (GEOVENER) BY CONTRIBUTING TO A PROCESS THAT IS BETTER-INFORMED TO SUPPORT END-TO-END PRODUCTION SYSTEMS AND RESULTS IN ACTIONABLE MEASURES TO ADDRESS CRITICAL GLOBAL AND REGIONAL CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES IN ENERGY SERVICES."

LONG TERM HUMAN MISSIONS REQUIRE SUSTAINED CREW HEALTH AND SAFETY. A RESEARCH AREA THAT IS IMPORTANT IN SUSTAINING CREW HEALTH IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF IMPROVED SPACEFLIGHT-SUITABLE METHODS FOR MICROBIOLOGICAL MONITORING, AS WELL AS CONTAMINATION CONTROL AND REDUCTION. THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS) IS A CONFINED AND ISOLATED HABITAT IN AN EXTREME, HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT. THE HUMAN AND HABITAT MICROFLORA VARIES IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ABOARD THE ISS. CHANGES IN THE MICROFLORA MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED HEALTH RISK FOR THE CREW. MICROORGANISMS INCLUDING MICROBIAL BIOFILMS HAVE BEEN FOUND ON VARIOUS HABITAT SURFACES, INSIDE THE AIR AND WATER HANDLING SYSTEMS AS WELL AS THE HARDWARE USED ON THE ISS. BIOFILMS ARE KNOWN TO CAUSE DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT FROM POLYMER DETERIORATION, METAL CORROSION AND BIO-FOULING. THE PRIMARY CONCERN REGARDING CREW HEALTH IS CHARACTERIZED BY ACTIVITY OF OPPORTUNISTIC PATHOGENIC MICROORGANISMS THAT HAVE BEEN NOTED TO ACCUMULATE IN THE CLOSED ENVIRONMENTS OF THE ISS AND OTHER SPACECRAFT ON LONG-DURATION MISSIONS. UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECTS OF THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT, ESPECIALLY ALTERED GRAVITY, ON MICROBIAL BIOFILMS IS CRUCIAL FOR THE SUCCESS OF LONG-TERM HUMAN SPACE MISSIONS. SURFACE-ASSOCIATED BIOFILM COMMUNITIES WERE ABUNDANT ON THE MIR SPACE STATION AND CONTINUE TO BE A CHALLENGE ON THE ISS. THE HEALTH AND SAFETY HAZARDS LINKED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIOFILMS ARE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN DUE TO THE SUPPRESSION OF HUMAN IMMUNE FUNCTION OBSERVED DURING SPACEFLIGHT. VARIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CERTAIN METALS REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CONTACT-MEDIATED MICROBIAL INFECTIONS. ANTIMICROBIAL SURFACES ARE DEFINED AS MATERIALS THAT CONTAIN AN ANTIMICROBIAL AGENT SUCH AS SILVER, COPPER AND THEIR ALLOYS THAT INHIBITS OR REDUCES THE ABILITY OF MICROORGANISMS TO GROW ON THE SURFACE OF A MATERIAL. ANTIMICROBIAL SURFACES ARE FUNCTIONALIZED IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PROCESSES. THE INTRODUCTION OF ANTIMICROBIAL SURFACES FOR MEDICAL, PHARMACEUTICAL AND INDUSTRIAL PURPOSES HAS SHOWN THEIR UNIQUE POTENTIAL FOR REDUCING AND PREVENTING MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION. THE CONTACT KILLING OF SEVERAL TYPES OF MICROORGANISMS BY COPPER HAS BEEN ASSESSED IN MULTIPLE LABORATORY INVITRO STUDIES. FOR SUSTAINED CREW HEALTH AND SAFETY ADDITIONAL STUDIES ON THE MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN THE FORMATION OF MICROBIAL BIOFILMS AND THEIR EFFICIENT DESTRUCTION UNDER SPACEFLIGHT CONDITIONS, I.E., LONG-TERM GROWTH AND ADAPTATION TO LOW GRAVITY ENVIRONMENTS, ARE NEEDED. THE HYPOTHESIS TO BE TESTED BY METALLICA IS THAT SURFACES CONTAINING COPPER AND/OR SILVER WILL INHIBIT BIOFILM FORMATION UNDER ALTERED GRAVITY REGIMES TO A LESSER EXTENT THAN IN 1 X G DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE INTERACTION WITH THE METAL IONS ON THE SURFACE IS SLOWER BECAUSE THEIR MOVEMENT AROUND THE CELL IS RESTRICTED TO DIFFUSION. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT AND THE RATE, IF ANY, OF COPPER AND/OR SILVER SURFACES ON MICROBIAL GROWTH RATE, TOTAL BIOMASS ACCUMULATION, AND BIOFILM FORMATION. THE GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A CONCEPTUAL MODEL DESCRIBING THE AFFECT OF MICRO-GRAVITY ON BIOFILM FORMATION GROWN ON NON-INHIBITING SURFACES AS WELL AS ON METAL SURFACES THAT ARE POTENTIAL BIOFILM GROWTH INHIBITORS. THE APPROACH WILL BE TO TEST THREE DIFFERENT MICROBIAL MODEL SYSTEMS (I.E., ESCHERICHIA COLI K12, A STAPHYLOCOCCUS SP. ISOLATE FROM THE ISS, AND THE HEAVY METAL RESISTANT STRAIN CUPRIAVIDUS METALLIDURANS CH34) FOR BIOFILM FORMATION ON VARIOUS COPPER- AND SILVER-SURFACES, AS WELL AS INERT SURFACES AS CONTROLS. THESE SURFACES DIFFER IN THEIR ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY BASED ON CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND/OR GEOMETRIC NANOSTRUCTURES. THESE SURFACES WILL BE TESTED FOR BIOFILM FORMATION RATES UNDER DIFFERENT SPACEFLIGHT RELEVANT GRAVITATIONAL REGIMES (E.G., MOON 0.16 X G, MARS 0.38 X G, G ISS AND 1 X G CONTROL). MICROBIAL GROWTH WILL OCCUR UNDER OPTIMAL BIOFILM-INDUCING CON"

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

THIS WILL PROVIDE A MORE GENERAL VIEW ON THE POSSIBLE EMERGENCE OF PREBIOTIC ENVIRONMENTS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. OUR TEAM HAS AN EXTENSIVE EXPERTISE IN THE CHEMISTRY, RADIATIVE TRANSFER, AND ATMOSPHERIC KINETIC PROCESSES RELEVANT TO THIS STUDY. OUR RECENT WORK HAS ANALYZED THE EMERGING ATMOSPHERES OF TERRESTRIAL PLANETS AFTER GIANT IMPACTS, USING A WELL-ESTABLISHED RADIATIVECONVECTIVE ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE CODE, WITH AN EXTENSIVE OPACITY DATABASE FOR ALL RELEVANT MOLECULES, AND THE CHEMISTRY SELF-CONSISTENTLY CALCULATED FOR VAPOR IN EQUILIBRIUM WITH A MAGMA OCEAN (LUPU ET AL. 2014). WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED THE CHEMISTRY CODE TO STUDY THE TRANSIENT IMPACT CHEMISTRY AND PHOTOCHEMISTRY, INCLUDING NEARLY ALL THE SMALL MOLECULES AND FREE RADICALS THAT CAN BE MADE FROM H, C, N, O, AND S. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ATMOSPHERIC CODE AND THE ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE CALCULATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED BY R. LUPU, S. VAHIDINIA AND M. MARLEY AT NASA AMES, AND BY T. ROBINSON AT UCSC. S. VAHIDINIA WILL ALSO PERFORM CALCULATIONS RELATED TO HAZE AND CLOUD AGGREGATE OPACITIES. R. FREEDMAN AT SETI INSTITUTE WILL ADVISE ON MOLECULAR OPACITY UPDATES.

DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE CHROMOSPHERE REQUIRES MORE THAN ONE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OF NON-THERMAL ENERGY MORE THAN THE ENTIRE CORONA, VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE HEATING MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR HEATING THIS LAYER. THE LACK OF INSIGHT INTO CHROMOSPHERIC ENERGETICS IS IN PART BECAUSE IT IS A HIGHLY DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPLEX REGION WITH VARIOUS PHYSICAL PROCESSES PLAYING AN IMPORTANT ROLE: RADIATIVE TRANSFER, SCATTERING, TIME DEPENDENT PARTIAL IONIZATION EFFECTS, ION-NEUTRAL INTERACTION EFFECTS (INIE), SUCH AS AMBIPOLAR DIFFUSION AND THE HALL TERM, AND THERMAL CONDUCTION ALONG THE MAGNETIC FIELD, WHICH IS IMPORTANT IN THE UPPER CHROMOSPHERE, TRANSITION REGION (TR), AND CORONA. MOREOVER, HINODE OBSERVATIONS HAVE REVEALED HOW PREVALENT SMALL-SCALE FLUX EMERGENCE (SSFE) IS IN THE SOLAR PHOTOSPHERE (SAINZ DALDA ET AL. 2012). WHILE CASE STUDIES SHOW THAT SOME OF THESE SSFE EVENTS EXPAND INTO AND IMPACT THE CHROMOSPHERE, IT IS STILL UNKNOWN HOW LARGE THE IMPACT IS OF THESE EVENTS ON CHROMOSPHERIC DYNAMICS AND ENERGETICS. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL EXPLOIT THE BEST FITTED NUMERICAL CODE FOR THIS MATTER AND INVESTIGATE, IN A REALISTIC MANNER, THE TWO PHYSICAL PROCESSES THAT HAVE POTENTIAL FOR INFLUENCING THE CHROMOSPHERIC ENERGY BALANCE: 1. AMBIPOLAR DIFFUSION, AND 2. SMALL SCALE FLUX EMERGENCE BY INTRODUCING IN A REALISTIC MANNER RANDOM, WEAK, SMALL-SCALE, EMERGING FLUX THROUGH THE BOTTOM BOUNDARY IN ADDITION MAGNETIC FIELD INCREASED BY THE LOCAL DYNAMO AS A RESULT OF THE HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF THE SIMULATIONS.  OUR COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH TO THE INIE WILL BE THE FIRST REALISTIC TREATMENT OF THE COMPLEX, HIGHLY NON-LINEAR THERMODYNAMICS AND IONIZATION THAT ARE CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF NEUTRALS. TO CONSTRUCT MODELS WE WILL USE THE BIFROST CODE (GUDIKSEN ET AL 2011), WHICH SOLVES THE 3D RADIATIVE MHD EQUATIONS AND INCLUDES REALISTIC APPROACHES TO MANY OF THE COMPLEX PHYSICAL EFFECTS MENTIONED ABOVE. THESE MODELS ARE SELF-CONSISTENT, I.E., THE SIMULATIONS INCLUDE THE UPPER CONVECTION ZONE AND THE CONVECTIVE MOTIONS STRESS THE MAGNETIC FIELD IN THE LOWER ATMOSPHERE, WHICH LEADS TO THE CURRENT DISSIPATION THAT ENERGIZES THE UPPER CHROMOSPHERE AND HEATS AND MAINTAINS A HOT CORONA. WE HAVE RECENTLY EXPANDED THE BIFROST CODE TO INCLUDE THE GENERALIZED OHM S LAW (HALL AND AMBIPOLAR DIFFUSION TERMS) IN THE INDUCTION EQUATION, AND THE INTRODUCTION OF SMALL-SCALE, MIXED POLARITY FIELDS ON GRANULAR SCALES. IN ADDITION, THE BIFROST CODE INCLUDES NON-EQUILIBRIUM HYDROGEN IONIZATION AND RADIATIVE TRANSFER USING A NON-GREY AND NON-LTE APPROXIMATION WITH COHERENT SCATTERING."

YET THEY ARE CRUCIAL FOR BETTER PREDICTIONS OF SEA ICE MELT AND RE-FREEZE IN SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM CLIMATE MODELING. WHILE CLIMATE MODELS AND SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER IN ACHIEVING LONG-TERM, REGIONAL COVERAGE OF THE ARCTIC CLIMATE SYSTEM, LARGE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THEM REMAIN IN THE CHARACTERIZATION OF BOUNDARY LAYER (BL) ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY, ACCURATE SURFACE PROPERTIES, AND BL CLOUDS, WHICH ARE INTIMATELY LINKED TO THE SURFACE ENERGY BALANCE. IN FACT, SURFACE RADIATIVE FLUX (SRF) ESTIMATIONS FROM SATELLITES (E.G. CERES) RELY HEAVILY ON MODELED FIELDS OF TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY, SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS AND CLOUDS. ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO MODEL PREDICTION BIASES IN THE ARCTIC IS THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT NEAR-SURFACE OBSERVATIONS THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR A MORE THOROUGH EVALUATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF TARGETED PARAMETERIZATIONS SUITABLE FOR THE ARCTIC REGION.  WE PROPOSE TO UTILIZE UNIQUE OBSERVATIONAL DATA SETS FROM TWO NASA AIRBORNE CAMPAIGN OVER THE ARCTIC: ARISE (ARCTIC RADIATION ICEBRIDGE SEA&ICE EXPERIMENT-FALL 2014) AND OIB (OPERATION ICE BRIDGE-SPRING AND 2014/2015 AND SUMMER 2016) TO QUANTIFY BIAS AND SENSITIVITY, AND TO IMPROVE PREDICTION OF BL CLOUDS AND SRF IN ARCTIC RE-ANALYSES AND FORECAST MODELS. KEY INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED SPECTRAL AND BROADBAND SPECTROMETERS FOR SHORTWAVE AND LONG WAVE FLUX MEASUREMENTS, ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE SENSORS, IN-SITU AND REMOTE-SENSING CLOUD SENSORS, LASER ALTIMETERS AND RADARS FOR SURFACE CHARACTERIZATION, AND A GEO-LOCATED DIGITAL CAMERA MAPPING SYSTEM. THIS WEALTH OF HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION DATA - TAKEN UNDER A WIDE VARIETY OF ATMOSPHERIC, CLOUD AND SURFACE CONDITIONS OVER THE ARCTIC OCEAN - WILL BE USED TO DERIVE GROUND-TRUTH MEASURES OF ATMOSPHERIC STATE, CLOUD VERTICAL PROFILES AND NEAR SURFACE RADIATIVE FLUX FIELDS. WITH THESE DERIVED MEASURES WE WILL OBJECTIVELY DEFINE THE BIAS AND SENSITIVITY OF THESE MODELS UNDER THE OBSERVED CONDITIONS, AND EVALUATE THEIR PREDICTION SKILL BY TESTING VARIOUS PARAMETRIZATION SCHEMES. SUCH INFORMATION PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PROCESS LEVEL ANALYSIS OF THE PHYSICAL SCHEMES MOST IMPORTANT FOR BL CLOUDS AND SRF PREDICTIONS, WITH THE OUTCOME OF SETTING GUIDELINES TOWARDS UPDATING SPECIFIC PARAMETERIZATION SCHEMES OVER THE ARCTIC. CONCRETELY, WE WILL ACHIEVE THIS THROUGH THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES: 1.DEVELOP SRF GROUND-TRUTH MEASURES FROM HIGH VERTICAL RESOLUTION AIRBORNE OBSERVATIONS USING RADIATIVE TRANSFER SIMULATIONS.  2.  DETERMINE RE-ANALYSES (MERRA/MERRA-2) AND FORECAST (POLAR-WRF) MODEL DISCREPANCIES AND BIAS-SENSITIVITY TO THE ATMOSPHERIC STATE, CLOUD REGIMES AND SURFACE TYPES.  3.  IMPROVE MODEL REPRESENTATIONS OF ARCTIC RELATIVE HUMIDITY FIELDS AND SEA-ICE ALBEDO USING OBSERVATIONS, AND EMBED THEM IN THE NASA GEOS-5 SINGLE COLUMN MODEL (SCM) TO ANSWER HOW OBSERVATION-DERIVED PARAMETERIZATIONS AFFECT MODEL PREDICTION SENSITIVITY AND SKILL.  4.TEST GEOS-5 AND POLAR-WRF PREDICTION SKILL SENSITIVITY TO VARIOUS PARAMETERIZATION SCHEMES BY GENERATING SCM SIMULATIONS DRIVEN BY MERRA/MERRA-2/ERA-I AND ASR RE-ANALYSES, UTILIZING OBSERVATIONALLY-DERIVED SRF AND BL CLOUD FIELDS IN THE ASSESSMENT, DETERMINING RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE OPTIMIZED PARAMETER SET FOR FUTURE USE.

PRELIMINARY WORK SHOWS THAT THE DIVISION BETWEEN SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES AND EXOPLANETS WITH AND WITHOUT ATMOSPHERES FOLLOW TRENDS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY CONSISTENT WITH TWO DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERIC ESCAPE PROCESSES. THE TWO MECHANISMS ARE IMPACT EROSION, WHEN GASES ARE LOST AS A RESULT OF LARGE BODY IMPACTS, AND HYDRODYNAMIC ESCAPE, WHEN ATMOSPHERES EXPAND AND ESCAPE BECAUSE OF HEATING BY STELLAR IRRADIATION. DATA SUGGEST THAT IMPACT EROSION OBLITERATES ATMOSPHERES WHEN MEDIAN IMPACT VELOCITIES EXCEED -5 TIMES THE ESCAPE VELOCITY. ALTERNATIVELY, THE OBSERVED DIVISION COULD BE INTERPRETED AS A POWER LAW WHERE STELLAR HEATING GOES AS THE FOURTH POWER OF ESCAPE VELOCITY, WHICH MIGHT BE EXPLAINED IF HYDRODYNAMIC ESCAPE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ATMOSPHERIC LOSS RATHER THAN IMPACT EROSION.

WE WILL USE FULLY NONGREY RADIATIVE-CONVECTIVE ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE CODES WITH CLOUD FORMATION AND VERTICAL MIXING, COMBINED WITH A SELF-CONSISTENT TREATMENT OF GAS CHEMISTRY ABOVE THE MAGMA OCEAN.

WE WILL DERIVE THE ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE AND ESCAPE RATES CONSIDERING BOTH VOLATILEFREE AND VOLATILE BEARING COMPOSITIONS, WHICH REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF HOT ROCKY PLANET ATMOSPHERES. OUR MODELS WILL INFORM FOLLOWUP OBSERVATIONS WITH JWST AND GROUND-BASED INSTRUMENTS, AID THE INTERPRETATION OF TRANSIT AND ECLIPSE SPECTRA, AND PROVIDE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF VOLATILE LOSS IN THESE ATMOSPHERES. SUCH RESULTS WILL HELP REFINE OUR PICTURE OF ROCKY PLANET FORMATION AND EVOLUTION. PLANETS IN ULTRA-SHORT PERIOD (USP) ORBITS ARE A SPECIAL CLASS OF HOT ROCKY EXOPLANETS. AS SHOWN BY KEPLER, THESE PLANETS ARE GENERALLY SMALLER THAN 2 EARTH RADII, SUGGESTING THAT THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE ROCKY AND COULD HAVE LOST THEIR VOLATILES THROUGH PHOTO-EVAPORATION. BEING CLOSE TO THEIR HOST STARS, THESE PLANETS ARE ULTRA-HOT, WITH ESTIMATED TEMPERATURES OF 1000-3000 K. A NUMBER OF USP PLANETS HAVE BEEN ALREADY DISCOVERED (E.G. KEPLER-78 B, COROT-7 B, KEPLER-10 B), AND THIS NUMBER IS EXPECTED TO GROW BY CONFIRMING ADDITIONAL PLANET CANDIDATES. THE CHARACTERIZATION OF PLANETS ON ULTRA-SHORT ORBITS IS ADVANTAGEOUS DUE TO THE LARGER NUMBER OF OBSERVABLE TRANSITS, AND THE LARGER TRANSIT SIGNAL IN THE CASE OF AN EVAPORATING ATMOSPHERE. MUCH ADVANCE HAS BEEN MADE IN UNDERSTANDING AND CHARACTERIZING HOT JUPITERS IN SIMILAR TRANSIT CONFIGURATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, NA HAS BEEN THE FIRST SPECIES TO BE DETECTED IN AN EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERE, BY OBSERVING THE EVAPORATING HOT-JUPITER HD209458B.

WE WILL EXPAND ON THIS WORK BY CONSIDERING A WIDER RANGE OF CHEMICAL COMPOSITIONS, ASSESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF CLOUDS AND GENERATING CLOUDY MODELS, AND DEVELOPING DIS-EQUILIBRIUM MODELS BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT VERTICAL MIXING AND PHOTOCHEMISTRY. PHOTO-EVAPORATION WILL BE CONSIDERED IN THE ENERGY BALANCE BETWEEN HEATING, COOLING AND MASS LOSS. WE ALSO HAVE IN-HOUSE CODES TO GENERATE HIGH-RESOLUTION ECLIPSE SPECTRA AND PREDICT TRANSIT DEPTHS AND OBSERVABLE SIGNATURES.

COMMONLY, THE INTERPLANETARY TRANSPORT OF SEPS IS DESCRIBED BY A KINETIC, FOKKER-PLANCK (FP) TYPE OF EQUATION. HOWEVER, DUE TO ITS DIFFUSIVE NATURE IN THE PERPENDICULAR TRANSPORT, THIS APPROACH FALLS SHORT IN EXPLAINING THE FAST ACCESS OF PARTICLES TO A WIDE RANGE OF LONGITUDES. WE PROPOSE TO EXTEND THE ANALYSIS OF WIDESPREAD SEP EVENTS TO INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF FIELD-LINE WANDERING IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE RELEVANT TRANSPORT PROCESSES IN THESE EVENTS. SCIENCE QUESTIONS: IN THIS PROPOSAL WE AIM TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING SCIENCE QUESTIONS: (1) HOW ARE SEPS ABLE TO QUICKLY ACCESS LONGITUDINALLY WIDELY SEPARATED LOCATIONS IN THE INNER HELIOSPHERE? (2) WHICH ROLE DOES INTERPLANETARY TURBULENCE PLAY IN CROSS-FIELD TRANSPORT OF PARTICLES AND HOW DO SPATIAL VARIATIONS IMPACT ON PARTICLE DISTRIBUTIONS? (3) WHAT IS THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE NEAR-SUN INJECTION REGION OF SEPS VS. INTERPLANETARY TRANSPORT EFFECTS FOR THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF SEPS? (4) HOW ARE ELECTRON ENERGY SPECTRA SHAPED DURING THEIR TRANSPORT FROM COMPACT FLARING REGIONS TO 1AU? METHODS: A COMBINATION OF MODELING AND DATA ANALYSIS WILL HELP TO UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DIFFERENT TRANSPORT PROCESSES INVOLVED IN SEP PROPAGATION. WE WILL USE A NOVEL, RECENTLY DEVELOPED TRANSPORT MODEL WHICH INCLUDES PARTICLE MOTION ALONG FIELD LINES THAT MEANDER AS A RESULT OF PLASMA TURBULENCE. SUCH A NON-DIFFUSIVE PROPAGATION MODE CAN BE SHOWN TO DOMINATE THE SEP CROSS-FIELD PROPAGATION EARLY IN THE SEP EVENT HISTORY. WE WILL COMPARE THE NEW MODEL RESULTS TO THE STANDARD MODELING USING ONLY A FOKKER- PLANCK EQUATION WITH DIFFUSIVE PERPENDICULAR TRANSPORT, USING BOTH IDEALIZED SEP EVENTS AND A DATASET OF SEP OBSERVATIONS. THESE WILL INCLUDE IN-SITU ELECTRON AND ION OBSERVATIONS AND CONTEXTUAL REMOTE OBSERVATIONS OF THE SUN AND SOLAR ATMOSPHERE. RELEVANCE: STUDYING THE TRANSPORT PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH ENERGETIC PARTICLES ARRIVING AT EARTH ORBIT IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE FOR SPACE EXPLORATION, SINCE SEPS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE RADIATION LEVELS IN THE NEAR-EARTH ENVIRONMENT, POTENTIALLY DAMAGING TECHNOLOGICAL ASSETS AND IMPACTING ON THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF HUMANS IN SPACE. OUR PROPOSAL DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE SCIENCE GOALS OF THE STEREO MISSION (\UNDERSTAND HOW SEPS ARE DISTRIBUTED SO EFFICIENTLY AROUND THE SUN\"") AND THREE OF THE FOUR DECADAL SURVEY GOALS. THIS RESEARCH IS TIMELY DUE TO THE OBSERVATIONS OF WIDESPREAD SEP EVENTS BY STEREO AND THE UPCOMING SOLAR PROBE PLUS AND SOLAR ORBITER MISSIONS, WHICH WILL ADD FURTHER TO OUR OBSERVATIONAL BASIS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND ENERGETIC PARTICLE PROPAGATION IN THE INNER HELIOSPHERE."""

WE PRESENT A RELEVANCY SCENARIO, EVENT-BASED HYDROMETEOROLOGICAL SCIENCE DATA ANALYSIS, WHICH HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR THESE FEATURES THAT WOULD MAXIMIZE THE POTENTIAL OF DERECHOS FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. PROPOSED SOLUTION: WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP DERECHOS, AN EXTENSION OF AES, THAT: (1) GENERALIZES THE UNDERLYING REPRESENTATION TO SUPPORT IRREGULARLY SPACED OBSERVATIONS SUCH AS POINT AND SWATH DATA, (2) INCORPORATES APPROPRIATE RE-GRIDDING AND INTERPOLATION UTILITIES TO ENABLE ANALYSIS ACROSS DATA FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES, (3) INTRODUCES NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION (NDR) TO FACILITATE IDENTIFICATION OF SCIENTIFIC RELATIONSHIPS AMONG HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATASETS, AND (4) INTEGRATES MOVING OBJECT DATABASE TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE TREATMENT OF CONTINUITY FOR THE EVENTS WITH COARSE REPRESENTATION IN TIME. WITH THESE FEATURES, DERECHOS WILL BECOME A POWERFUL ENVIRONMENT THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR A VERY WIDE VARIETY OF EARTH SCIENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS. RESEARCH STRATEGY: DERECHOS WILL BE CREATED BY INTEGRATING VARIOUS SEPARATELY DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES. IN MOST CASES THIS WILL REQUIRE SOME RE-IMPLEMENTATION TO EXPLOIT SCIDB, THE UNDERLYING DATABASE THAT HAS STRONG SUPPORT FOR MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCIENTIFIC DATA. WHERE POSSIBLE, SYNTHETIC DATA/INPUTS WILL BE GENERATED TO FACILITATE INDEPENDENT TESTING OF NEW COMPONENTS. A SCIENTIFIC USE CASE WILL BE USED TO DERIVE SPECIFIC INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS AND TO DEMONSTRATE INTEGRATION SUCCESS. SIGNIFICANCE: FRESHWATER RESOURCES ARE PREDICTED TO BE A MAJOR FOCUS OF CONTENTION AND CONFLICT IN THE 21ST CENTURY. THUS, HYDROMETEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY COMMUNITIES ARE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTED BY THE SUPERIOR RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH AES, WHICH HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED FOR TWO REAL-WORLD USE CASES.

HOWEVER, EVEN AFTER DECADES OF SPACEFLIGHT MISSIONS, WE DO NOT KNOW IF MEDICATIONS ACT THE SAME IN THE SPACEFLIGHT ENVIRONMENT AS THEY DO ON EARTH. ASPECTS OF THE SPACEFLIGHT ENVIRONMENT (LOW GRAVITY, RADIATION EXPOSURE, CLOSED ENVIRONMENT, STRESS) HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO ALTER HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY. FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES, SOME OF THESE PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES COULD BE EXPECTED TO ALTER EITHER PHARMACOKINETICS (PK, HOW THE BODY ABSORBS, DISTRIBUTES, METABOLIZE AND EXCRETES ADMINISTERED MEDICATIONS) OR PHARMACODYNAMICS (PD, RECEPTORS OR SIGNALLING SYSTEMS THAT ARE THE TARGETS OF MEDICATION ACTION). ANECDOTAL DATA HAS SUGGESTED THAT, AT LEAST FOR CERTAIN MEDICATIONS OR INDICATIONS, INFLIGHT MEDICATION EFFICACY IS POOR, AND SPACEFLIGHT CREW USE HIGH DOSES, REPEATED DOSES, OR EVEN EXPERIENCE APPARENT TREATMENT FAILURES; FORTUNATELY NONE OF THESE EPISODES HAS BEEN SERIOUS ENOUGH TO CAUSE INJURY OR EVACUATION FROM LOW-EARTH ORBIT (LEO). HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO PREPARE FOR EXPLORATION MISSIONS WHERE SPEEDY EVACUATION TO EARTH MAY NOT BE A POSSIBILITY, THE LIKELIHOOD OF UNEXPECTED MEDICATION ACTION MUST BE DETERMINED. NEW STUDIES HAVE YIELDED THE FIRST DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE OF APPARENT TREATMENT FAILURES IN LOW EARTH ORBIT. THESE INSTANCES COULD BE EXPLAINED BY ALTERATIONS IN PK OR PD. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT THE SPACEFLIGHT ENVIRONMENT ALTERS HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY IN WAYS THAT AFFECT HOW MEDICATIONS ULTIMATELY EXERT THEIR ACTIONS, EITHER BY CHANGING PK OR PD. SPECIFICALLY, WE PROPOSE TO: (1) TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PK FOLLOWING ADMINISTRATION OF A MEDICATION IS DIFFERENT DURING SPACEFLIGHT AS COMPARED TO GROUNDBASED DATA FROM THE SAME SUBJECT, AND (2) TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT MEDICATION ACTION (PD) IS DIFFERENT DURING SPACEFLIGHT AS COMPARED TO GROUND-BASED DATA FROM THE SAME SUBJECT.

THESE MEDICATIONS ALL HAVE TARGETS IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, AND SHARE ACTION ON SLEEP OR WAKEFULNESS, PERMITTING USE OF THE SAME SUITE OF PD MEASURES.

CIRCULATING CONCENTRATIONS IN THE BLOODSTREAM WILL BE MEASURED OVER TIME AFTER MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION, PERMITTING MODELED ESTIMATION OF ABSORPTION RATES AND METABOLISM/EXCRETION RATES. SAME-SUBJECT COMPARISONS USING PRE-FLIGHT AND POST-FLIGHT TEST SESSIONS WILL PERMIT MEASUREMENT OF SAME-SUBJECT VARIABILITY THAT WILL PROVIDE A BASELINE FOR DETERMINATION OF CLINICALLY RELEVANT CHANGES DURING SPACEFLIGHT. SPACEFLIGHT VS. GROUND DIFFERENCES IN MEDICATION-ASSOCIATED EFFECTS ON SLEEP, WAKEFULNESS, AND SEVERAL MEASURES OF COGNITIVE FUNCTION WILL BE USED AS MEASURES OF PHARMCODYNAMICS.THIS STUDY WILL DETERMINE IF THE LEO ENVIRONMENT OF THE ISS ALTERS THE ACTIONS OF THREE COMMON MEDICATIONS. A LIKELY OUTCOME, RELEVANT FOR NASA MISSIONS, IS OPTIMIZED DOSING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ONE OR MORE OF THESE MEDICATIONS.

RECENT ICE SHAPE LASER SCANNING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ICING RESEARCH TUNNEL (IRT) AT NASA GLENN RESEARCH CENTER HAVE ENABLED TRANSFORMATIVE INSIGHTS INTO THE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL EVOLUTION OF ROUGHNESS ON SYMMETRIC AIRFOILS IN LOW SPEED CONDITIONS. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL INCLUDE 1) CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF THE AIRFOIL ROUGHNESS EVALUATION SYSTEM (ARES) SOFTWARE FOR LASER SCAN POINT CLOUDS MEASURED ON SWEPT SURFACES OF VARYING CROSS SECTIONAL AREA, 2) ANALYSIS OF ICE ROUGHNESS ACCRETED ON LAMINAR FLOW WINGS AND BLENDED BODY SHAPES REPRESENTATIVE OF N+2 AND N +3 GEOMETRIES USING THE APPROACH OF MCCLAIN AND KREEGER (2013), AND 3) CHARACTERIZATION OF CONVECTION ON SURFACES USING REALISTIC UNWRAPPED ROUGHNESS AND MODEL ROUGHNESS IN A FLAT PLATE SUBSONIC WIND TUNNEL EMPLOYING THIN-FILM HEATERS AND INFRARED SURFACE TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS IN STEADY STATE CONDITIONS. PHASE I EFFORTS WILL FOCUS ON CHARACTERIZING ROUGHNESS EVOLUTION AND ENHANCED CONVECTION ON LAMINAR-FLOW AIRFOILS. PHASE II EFFORTS WILL COMPLETE THE LAMINAR-FLOW AIRFOIL INVESTIGATION AND INCLUDE THE INVESTIGATION OF ROUGHNESS EVOLUTION AND ENHANCED CONVECTION ON SWEPT WINGS AND BLENDED/HYBRID SURFACES. THE PROPOSED COLLABORATIVE ACTIVITIES WILL 1) ILLUMINATE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL ROUGHNESS EVOLUTION FOR N+2 AND N+3 GEOMETRIES AND FLIGHT ENVELOPES, 2) VERIFY PROPER ROUGHNESS SCALING APPROACHES FOR N+2 AND N+3 GEOMETRIES AND FLIGHT ENVELOPES, 3) REVEAL CONVECTIVE ENHANCEMENT CAUSED BY THE ROUGHNESS ON N+2 AND N+3 BASED GEOMETRIES, AND 4) VALIDATE CONVECTION MODELING APPROACHES BASED ON THE DISCRETE-ELEMENT ROUGHNESS APPROACH. THE ROUGHNESS CHARACTERIZATION EFFORTS ARE EXPECTED TO INCLUDE COLLABORATIVE WORK PERFORMED IN THE IRT. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE COST OF OPERATING THE IRT, A PARALLEL PROPOSAL COMPLEMENTING THIS EFFORT IS BEING SUBMITTED BY PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY (PSU) TO GENERATE ICE ROUGHNESS ON STRAIGHT LAMINAR-FLOW AIRFOILS SIMULATING N+2 AND N+3 TECHNOLOGIES USING THE AERTS FACILITY. FURTHER PARALLEL EFFORTS AT PSU WILL COMPLEMENT THE FLAT PLATE CONVECTION STUDIES PERFORMED AT BAYLOR UNIVERSITY BY CHARACTERIZING UNSTEADY CONVECTION FROM N+2 AND N+3 AIRFOIL GEOMETRIES WITH ROUGHNESS."

HOWEVER, MANY REEFS HAVE DETERIORATED DUE TO LOCAL HUMAN ACTIVITIES, AND THE REST MAY NOT BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND THE ADDED STRESSES BROUGHT BY CLIMATE CHANGE. PREDICTIONS ARE DIRE, BUT THE UNDERLYING DATA ARE SURPRISINGLY SPARSE. FOR THE HAWAIIAN ARCHIPELAGO, FROM THE BIG ISLAND TO KURE ATOLL, NO MORE THAN 5 PERCENT OF REEF AREA HAS BEEN QUANTITATIVELY SURVEYED IN THE PAST 10 YEARS. FURTHER, THE DATA THAT DO EXIST SHOW PATTERNS THAT ARE COUNTER TO PRESENT UNDERSTANDING OF HOW ENVIRONMENT IMPACTS REEFS. THE HYSPIRI PREPARATORY AIRBORNE ACTIVITIES BRINGING HIGH ALTITUDE AVIRIS FLIGHTS TO HAWAII IN 2016 IS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO FILL THE DATA GAP AND THEN TO REEVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CORAL REEF CONDITION AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS THAT ARE THOUGHT TO BE INFLUENTIAL. ADDITIONALLY, SINCE AVIRIS HAS PREVIOUSLY CONDUCTED A SIMILAR CAMPAIGN IN 2000, THERE IS VERY GOOD POTENTIAL TO INVESTIGATE HOW AT LEAST SOME OF HAWAII''S REEFS MAY HAVE CHANGED OVER A DECADE AND A HALF.  WE PROPOSE TO USE THE 2016 DATA TO QUANTIFY BENTHIC COVER AND PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY FOR ALL REEFS SURVEYED BY AVIRIS. WE WILL CONDUCT A MODEST FIELD STUDY IN KANEOHE BAY, OAHU FOR CALIBRATION AND VALIDATION OF THE REMOTE SENSING DATA AND PRODUCTS. WE WILL ANALYZE THE REMOTE SENSING DATA PRODUCTS AGAINST A SUITE OF BIO GEOPHYSICAL PARAMETERS READILY AVAILABLE FROM ANCILLARY SOURCES - OCEANOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS (SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE, SIGNIFICANT WAVE HEIGHT, ARAGONITE SATURATION), REEF GEOMORPHOLOGY AND AGE (INCREASING FROM THE BIG ISLAND TO KURE ATOLL), LAND COVER AND LAND-USE CHANGE, KNOWN PATTERNS OF BIODIVERSITY, AND LOCAL HUMAN THREATS (POLLUTION, DEVELOPMENT, OVERFISHING). PENDING AVAILABILITY AND SUITABILITY OF THE 2000 DATA SET, WE WILL INVESTIGATE HOW REEF CONDITION HAS CHANGED OVER TIME, AS WELL AS HOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REEF CONDITION AND THE ENVIRONMENT HAS CHANGED OVER TIME.  RESULTS WOULD BE IMPORTANT ON MANY LEVELS. ACHIEVING OUR OBJECTIVES REQUIRES DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A REMOTE SENSING DATA PROCESSING FLOW THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE MODIFIED FOR USE IN OTHER OPTICALLY SHALLOW WATER SYSTEMS BESIDES REEFS. THE MAPS OF REEF CONDITION WOULD PROVIDE A DENSE DATA SET OF REGION-SCALE REEF CONDITION, WHICH WOULD BE VALUABLE TO BOTH SCIENTISTS IN GENERAL AND HAWAII REEF MANAGERS IN PARTICULAR. THE ANALYSIS RELATING REEF CONDITION TO ENVIRONMENT WOULD PRODUCE A SET OF QUANTITATIVE, EMPIRICAL MODELS THAT CAN BE USED TO EVALUATE THE ROLES OF SPECIFIC DRIVERS OF CURRENT REEF CONDITION AND FORECAST REEF CONDITION UNDER PREDICTED SCENARIOS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. FINALLY, THE CHANGE ANALYSIS, WOULD BE, TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THE FIRST SYNOPTIC, AS OPPOSED TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF SMALL SITES, ANALYSIS OF CORAL REEF CHANGE AT THE REGION SCALE, POTENTIALLY IDENTIFYING BOTH BROAD REGIONAL TRENDS AND SITE-SPECIFIC AREAS OF CONCERN."

IT IS INCONTROVERTIBLY CLEAR THAT MANY REEFS ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DECLINE, OFTEN ATTRIBUTED TO DIRECT HUMAN IMPACTS. REEF ECOSYSTEMS MAY BE UNABLE TO WITHSTAND THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. HOWEVER, THE DATA ON  GLOBAL REEF CONDITION ARE VERY SPARSE: ONLY 0.01-0.1 OF THE WORLDS REEF AREA HAS BEEN SURVEYED, AND THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT GAP IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORAL REEFS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT. THE GOAL OF THE CORAL REEF AIRBORNE LABORATORY (CORAL) IS TO PROVIDE THE CRITICAL DATA AND NEW MODELS NEEDED TO ANALYZE THE STATUS OF CORAL REEFS AND TO PREDICT THEIR FUTURE. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, CORAL MAKES HIGH DENSITY OBSERVATIONS FOR A LARGE SAMPLE OF REEFS 8 PERCENT OF GLOBAL REEF AREA THAT OCCUR ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IMPLEMENTED IN EIGHT CAMPAIGNS ACROSS 10 CORAL REEF REGIONS IN THE INDIAN, PACIFIC, AND ATLANTIC OCEANS. CORAL ACQUIRES SPECTRAL IMAGE  DATA USING THE PORTABLE REMOTE IMAGING SPECTROMETER INSTRUMENT, OPERATED BY NASAS JET PROPULSION  LABORATORY, INSTALLED IN A POD UNDERNEATH A GULFSTREAM- III AIRPLANE, FLOWN BY NASAS JOHNSON SPACE CENTER. IN-WATER DATA ARE OBTAINED AT SELECT REEF SITES TO CALIBRATE AND VALIDATE THE REMOTE OBSERVATIONS AND PRODUCTS. FOR EACH REEF, THE SPECTRAL IMAGE DATA ARE PROCESSED TO PROVIDE THE REEF CONDITION DESCRIBED BY MEASURABLE QUANTITIES OF BENTHIC COVER OF CORAL, ALGAE, AND SAND PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; AND CALCIFICATION. CORAL IMAGE PRODUCTS ARE  ANALYZED AGAINST VALUES FOR BIOGEOPHYSICAL FORCINGS E.G. SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE, CARBONATE  CHEMISTRY, WHICH ARE ACQUIRED FROM PRE- EXISTING DATA SOURCES. THE RESULT IS A SET OF QUANTITATIVE, EMPIRICAL MODELS THAT CAN BE USED TO ESTIMATE CURRENT GLOBAL REEF CONDITION AND FORECAST REEF CONDITION UNDER SCENARIOS OF PREDICTED GLOBAL CHANGE. WITH THESE MODELS, SCIENTISTS,  RESOURCE MANAGERS, AND POLITICIANS CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW NATURAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC PROCESSES IMPACT REEFS, AND THUS MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS TOWARD THEIR CONSERVATION. CORAL OFFERS THE CLEAREST, MOST EXTENSIVE PICTURE TO DATE OF THE CONDITION OF A LARGE PORTION OF THE WORLDS CORAL REEFS FROM A UNIFORM DATA SET. THE DATA WILL REVEAL TRENDS BETWEEN CORAL REEF CONDITION AND  BIOGEOPHYSICAL FORCINGS, BOTH NATURAL AND THOSE ARISING FROM HUMAN ACTIVITIES. WITH THIS NEW UNDERSTANDING OF REEF CONDITION, WE CAN BETTER PREDICT THE FUTURE OF THIS GLOBAL ECOSYSTEM AND PROVIDE POLICY MAKERS WITH BETTER INFORMATION FOR THEIR DECISIONS REGARDING RESOURCE MANAGEMENT."

MOST PRIOR STUDIES HAVE RELIED ON DUAL ENERGY XRAY ABSORPTIOMETRY (DXA), A 2D TECHNIQUE USED TO ASSESS BONE MASS AT DIFFERENT SKELETAL SITES, TO ASSESS EFFECTS OF SPACEFLIGHT ON BONE STRENGTH AND FRACTURE RISK. HOWEVER, DXA BASED MEASUREMENTS ARE LIMITED IN SEVERAL REGARDS. FIRST, WHOLE BONE STRENGTH IS DETERMINED BY BONE MASS, BONE GEOMETRY AND INTRINSIC PROPERTIES OF THE BONE MATRIX AND DXA IS ONLY ABLE TO ASSESS BONE MASS. SECOND, DXA MEASUREMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO TECHNICAL ARTIFACTS DUE TO OVERLYING STRUCTURES (E.G., AORTIC CALCIFICATION), DEGENERATIVE CHANGES (E.G., OSTEOPHYTES), AND DIFFERENCES IN BODY SIZE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND WITHIN AN INDIVIDUAL OVER TIME. THIRD, DXA MEASUREMENTS ARE INADEQUATE FOR IDENTIFYING MECHANISMS UNDERLYING SKELETAL FRAGILITY, AS THEY CANNOT DISTINGUISH CHANGES IN TRABECULAR VERSUS CORTICAL BONE. NEWER TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING 3D QUANTITATIVE COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (QCT) ARE ABLE TO OVERCOME THE LIMITATIONS OF DXA. MOREOVER, QCT IMAGES CAN BE USED TO ESTIMATE BONE STRENGTH USING A STANDARD ENGINEERING APPROACH CALLED FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS. INDEED, QCT IMAGES HAVE BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY TO DEMONSTRATE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SPACEFLIGHT ON HIP BONE DENSITY AND STRENGTH. HOWEVER, A SIMILAR EXAMINATION OF THE EFFECTS OF SPACEFLIGHT ON VERTEBRAL STRENGTH HAS NOT BEEN PERFORMED. THUS THE DEGREE OF SPINAL DECONDITIONING AND SUBSEQUENT RISK OF VERTEBRAL FRACTURE FOLLOWING LONG DURATION SPACEFLIGHT REMAINS UNKNOWN. OUR CENTRAL OBJECTIVE IS TO ADDRESS THIS GAP IN KNOWLEDGE BY ASSESSING CHANGES IN VOLUMETRIC BONE DENSITY AND STRENGTH OF LUMBAR VERTEBRAE USING PREVIOUSLY COLLECTED QCT SCANS FROM LONG DURATION ISS CREWMEMBERS. IN ADDITION, SINCE BONE FRACTURES OCCUR WHEN THE FORCES APPLIED TO THE BONE EXCEED ITS STRENGTH, WE WILL ALSO ESTIMATE THE RISK OF SPINE FRACTURE BY COMPUTING A LOAD TO STRENGTH RATIO IN EACH ASTRONAUT FOR DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. VERTEBRAL STRENGTH WILL BE MEASURED USING AN FDA APPROVED METHOD THAT EMPLOYS FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSES OF QCT SCANS, AND HAS BEEN VALIDATED AGAINST IN VITRO BONE STRENGTH TESTING AS WELL AS IN LARGE, POPULATION BASED STUDIES OF SPINE FRACTURE. WE WILL ESTIMATE LOADS APPLIED TO THE SPINE USING A MUSCULOSKELETAL MODEL OF THE LUMBAR AND THORACIC SPINE THAT CAN BE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE ASTRONAUTS HEIGHT, WEIGHT, SPINAL SHAPE AND SPECIFIC TRUNK MUSCLE ANATOMY ALL FACTORS THAT ARE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS TO SPINAL LOADING. THIS WORK IS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT TO NASA AS BONE LOSS AND INCREASED FRACTURE RISK FOLLOWING LONG DURATION SPACEFLIGHT REMAIN KEY OPERATIONAL CONCERNS. SPECIFICALLY, THE PROPOSAL DIRECTLY ADDRESSES SEVERAL RISKS OUTLINES IN THE HUMAN RESEARCH PROGRAM (HRP) PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT FROM 2009  1) RISK OF INJURY FROM DYNAMIC LOADS 2) RISK OF BONE FRACTURE AND 3) RISK OF EARLY ONSET OSTEOPOROSIS DUE TO SPACEFLIGHT.  FURTHER, THE PROPOSED WORK ADDRESSES SEVERAL GAPS IDENTIFIED IN THE INTEGRATED RESEARCH PLAN, INCLUDING 1) OP5 WE DO NOT KNOW THE EXTENT TO WHICH SPACEFLIGHT DECONDITIONING DECREASES INJURY TOLERANCE FOR DYNAMIC LOADS 2) FRACTURE 3 WE NEED A VALIDATED METHOD TO ESTIMATE THE RISK OF FRACTURE BY EVALUATING THE RATIO OF APPLIED LOADS TO BONE FRACTURE LOADS AND 3) OSTEO 3 WE NEED A VALIDATED CLINICALLY RELEVANT METHOD FOR ASSESSING THE EFFECT OF SPACEFLIGHT ON OSTEOPOROSIS OR FRACTURE RISK IN LONG DURATION ASTRONAUTS. IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECTS OF SPACEFLIGHT ON VERTEBRAL FRAGILITY AND SPINAL LOADING WILL ALLOW DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE COUNTERMEASURES TO REDUCE THE RISK OF BONE FRACTURE IN ASTRONAUTS, AND MAY LEAD TO IMPROVEMENTS IN ASSESSMENT OF SPINE FRACTURE RISK IN OLDER ADULTS."

REMOVAL OR REDUCTION OF MECHANICAL LOADING PRECIPITATES MUSCLE ATROPHY AND BONE LOSS. THUS, DESPITE RIGOROUS EXERCISE PROTOCOLS AND OTHER COUNTERMEASURES, MUSCLE ATROPHY AND BONE LOSS ARE STILL VIRTUALLY INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCES OF SPACEFLIGHT. ONE APPROACH FOR AMELIORATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE UNTOWARD CONSEQUENCES OF SPACE TRAVEL IS BY THE INDUCTION OF ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY DURING SPACEFLIGHT VIA CENTRIFUGATION. THE STRENGTH OF THE ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY DEPENDS BOTH ON THE SPEED OF ROTATION AND DIAMETER OF THE SHIP. WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE EQUIVALENT 1.0G, IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT LOWER LEVELS OF FORCE MAY ALSO BE EFFECTIVE FOR PREVENTING MUSCLE ATROPHY AND IRREVERSIBLE BONE LOSS. IN THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSE TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY FOR THE PREVENTION OF MUSCLE ATROPHY AND WEAKNESS AND BONE LOSS BY STUDYING RATS USING AN INNOVATIVE SYSTEM FOR PARTIAL UNLOADING THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED PREVIOUSLY FOR MICE BY MEMBERS OF OUR TEAM. WE WILL STUDY THE MUSCULOSKELETAL RESPONSE OF ADULT MALE RATS (N=L 4 I GROUP) FOLLOWING EXPOSURE TO DIFFERENT DEGREES OF UNLOADING REPRESENTING 0.2G, 0.4G, AND 0. 7G AS WELL AS FULLY LOADED ANIMALS FOR 1, 2 AND 4 WEEKS. WE WILL STUDY THE IMPACT OF THIS PARTIAL GRAVITY ANALOG ENVIRONMENT ON MUSCLE AND BONE STMCTURE AND FUNCTION, INCLUDING PERFORMING HISTOLOGICAL ANALYSES, IN SITU FORCE MEASUREMENT OF MUSCLE CONTRACTION, AS WELL AS MEASUREMENT OF BONE MASS, MICROARCHITECTURE AND STRENGTH. IN ADDITION, WE WILL PERFORM BOTH SEROLOGICAL AND TISSUE MOLECULAR ANALYSES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS AND TIME COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT OF THESE CHANGES AT DIFFERENT DEGREES OF UNLOADING. THIS WORK WILL ALSO ALLOW US TO MORE EFFECTIVELY UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MUSCLE ATROPHY AND WEAKNESS AND BONE DETERIORATION AT VARYING LEVELS OF ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS STUDY, WE WILL HAVE DEFINED THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF PARTIAL ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY FOR PREVENTION OF MUSCULOSKELETAL DYSFUNCTION AND DETERIORATION.

A FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE IS TO PREDICT WHETHER NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION (NETPP) IN THIS REGION WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE UNDER CHANGING NORTHERLY AND SOUTHERLY ADVECTIVE FLOWS. HERE, WE SUGGEST THAT THE BALANCE WILL DEPEND ON REGIONAL BOTTOM-UP DRIVERS (E.G., STRATIFICATION, NUTRIENT AND LIGHT AVAILABILITY, COMMUNITY COMPOSITION) AND TOP-DOWN DRIVERS (E.G., GRAZING). . A GROWING UNDERSTANDING OF THE SURFACE AND DEEP OVERFLOWS, COUNTERFLOWS, AND RECIRCULATION PATTERNS WITHIN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC IS EMERGING THAT INDICATES STRONGER INFLUENCES OF THE ATLANTIC SURFACE WATER (AW) AND ARCTIC-ORIGIN WATER (ARW) ON EACH OTHER AND ON THE AVERAGE CIRCULATION PATTERNS WITHIN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. WE DEFINE THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC AS THE REGION ENCOMPASSED BY THE GREENLAND-ICELAND-NORWEGIAN (GIN), IRMINGER AND LABRADOR SEAS, WHERE WARMER AND SALTIER AW LADEN WITH NUTRIENTS, PLANKTON AND DETRITUS MOVES NORTH IN MULTIPLE BRANCHES INTO THE LABRADOR SEA, INTO THE GIN SEAS AND, EVENTUALLY, INTO THE ARCTIC OCEAN. FRESHER AND COLDER ARW WITH SEA ICE, LOW NUTRIENTS, LOW PLANKTON AND HIGH COLORED DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER MOVES SOUTHWARDS ALONG THE EDGE OF THE EASTERN GREENLAND AND WESTERN LABRADOR SEAS AND INTO THE N.

(Q2) WHAT ARE THE CONTROLS OF SEASONAL AND SUB-SEASONAL VARIABILITIES AND TRENDS IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC? (Q3) WHAT IS THE BALANCE BETWEEN LOCAL AND ADVECTED NETPP IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC DURING THE GROWTH SEASON? .

MODEL SIMULATIONS WILL BE DONE IN CONCERT WITH MINING HISTORICAL FIELD AND SATELLITE DATA TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF NETPP AND ITS PHYSICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CONTROLS OVER AN AVERAGE ANNUAL CYCLE IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC. . OUR RESULTS WILL SHED LIGHT IF THE MAGNITUDE OF NETPP WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE DUE TO ENHANCED STRATIFICATION (WARMER AW OR FRESHER ARW CONDITIONS, LESS NUTRIENTS) AND GRAZING (IMMIGRATING OR RETURNING ZOOPLANKTON). ALTERNATIVELY, LESS SEA ICE IN FRAM STRAIT AND THE GREENLAND SEA MAY RESULT IN MORE AND EARLIER OPEN WATERS AND LESS STRATIFICATION THAT MAY LEAD TO HIGHER NETPP VALUES, AS HAS BEEN PREDICTED NORTH AND EAST OF SPITSBERGEN.

IT DETECTS CACO3 OF COCCOLITHOPHORES DUE TO THEIR RELATIVELY HIGH ABUNDANCE IN THE SEA AND THEIR EXTREMELY HIGH PIC-SPECIFIC OPTICAL BACKSCATTERING.

OUR APPLICATION OF MISR TO COCCOLITHOPHORE STUDIES WILL ALLOW SMALLER-SCALE MEASUREMENTS OF BLOOMS AT #tilde#1/4 THE SPATIAL SCALE OF MODIS, WHICH WILL PROVIDE INSIGHTS ABOUT THE VARIOUS PHYSICAL PROCESSES AFFECTING THEIR DISTRIBUTION IN SPACE AND TIME. THE ADVENT OF AQUARIUS SALINITY DATA, WHEN COMBINED WITH MODIS SST DATA, NOW ALLOWS THE ESTIMATION OF SEA SURFACE DENSITY AND, USING GRADIENT FINDING ALGORITHMS, WILL ALLOW US TO DETERMINE WHETHER STEEP GRADIENTS IN COCCOLITHOPHORE DENSITY FALL AT MAJOR OCEAN HYDROGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES. VARIOUS OTHER DATA SETS AVAILABLE FROM THE CURRENT CONSTELLATION OF EARTH OBSERVING SATELLITES (E.G., WIND SPEED) WILL ALSO ALLOW BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPORTANCE OF FRONTAL BOUNDARIES AND WIND MIXING (USING AMSR-E; AQUARIUS), AS THEY INFLUENCE GLOBAL CALCITE PRODUCTION IN THE SEA. THIS PROPOSED WORK DIRECTLY FOCUSES ON TWO OF NASA''S FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS IN EARTH SCIENCE: (A) \""HOW IS THE GLOBAL EARTH SYSTEM CHANGING?\"" AND (B) \""WHAT ARE THE SOURCES OF CHANGE IN THE EARTH SYSTEM, THEIR MAGNITUDES, AND TRENDS?\"" THE WORK ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO OTHER CRITICAL NASA EARTH SCIENCE GOALS: TO QUANTIFY GLOBAL PRODUCTIVITY, BIOMASS, AND CARBON FLUXES; AND TO UNDERSTAND HOW MARINE ECOSYSTEMS (OF WHICH PIC IS A MAJOR PART OF THE GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE) ARE CHANGING.

WE PROPOSE TO USE A COMBINATION OF SATELLITE AND GNATS DATA (SHIPBOARD AND AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE MEASUREMENTS) TO CONSTRAIN A COUPLED PHYSICAL/ECOSYSTEM MODEL OF THE GOM CARBON CYCLE. THE OVERALL SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS IS THAT GNATS HAS PROVIDED CRITICAL CALIBRATION/VALIDATION DATA FOR SEAWIFS, MODIS, AND VIIRS SENSORS, AS WELL AS INSIGHTS ABOUT THE LONG-TERM OCEANOGRAPHIC CARBON CYCLE CHANGES IN THE GOM, A SEMI-ENCLOSED SHELF SEA, WITH STRONG LAND-SEA CONNECTIONS VIA 25 SURROUNDING WATERSHEDS. WE DIRECT THIS PROPOSAL TO THE SECOND RESEARCH THEME OF THE NASA ROSES 13 CARBON CYCLE SCIENCE PROGRAM: CARBON DYNAMICS ALONG TERRESTRIAL-AQUATIC INTERFACES, INCLUDING LAND-OCEAN, LAND-FRESHWATER, AND COASTAL OCEAN REGIONS. THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE MAJOR IMPORTANCE OF RIVER RUNOFF TO THE PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, OPTICAL AND BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY OF THE GOM, INCLUDING ITS CARBON CYCLE. THIS WORK IS PRIMARILY RELEVANT TO NASA (GIVEN THE NASA-CENTRIC GNATS SAMPLING) AND SECONDARILY TO NOAA, SPECIFICALLY FOR WORK ON PRODUCTIVITY, ALGAL BIOMASS, AND PHYTOPLANKTON FUNCTIONAL GROUPS OF U. S. COASTAL WATERS, AS WELL AS CALIBRATION/VALIDATION OF THE NPP/VIIRS SENSOR. ALONG WITH A WHOLE HOST OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES, GNATS MEASURES ALL FOUR PARTS OF THE MARINE CARBON CYCLE: PARTICULATE ORGANIC CARBON (POC), PARTICULATE INORGANIC CARBON (PIC; CALCITE), DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC), AND DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON (DIC; E.G., CO2, HCO3-, AND CO3=, WHICH ARE COUPLED TO PH AND ALKALINITY). THESE FOUR PARTS OF THE CARBON CYCLE (INCLUDING RESERVOIRS AND FLUXES) PROVIDE INSIGHTS ABOUT THE MAJOR PROCESSES AFFECTING THE COASTAL OCEAN, FROM CHANGES IN PRODUCTIVITY (I.E. POC VARIABILITY THROUGH TIME ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN HYDROGRAPHY, DIFFERENT PHYTOPLANKTON FUNCTIONAL GROUPS, ETC.), LAND-SEA CARBON TRANSPORT (I.E. DOC AND POC VARIABILITY CAUSED BY MAJOR RIVERINE FLOOD EVENTS AND DROUGHTS), AND CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH OCEAN ACIDIFICATION (I.E. VARIABILITY IN DIC AND PIC CAUSED BY CHANGES IN CARBONATE SATURATION). SIMPLY PUT, THE ONLY WAY TO PREDICT CHANGES TO ALL FOUR PARTS OF THE MARINE CARBON CYCLE AS A FUNCTION OF LONG-TERM CLIMATE CHANGE WILL BE THROUGH A COMBINED MEASUREMENT AND MODELING APPROACH. THE ECOSYSTEM MODEL TO BE USED FOR THE GULF OF MAINE CARBON CYCLE CONSISTS OF SIZE-STRUCTURED CARBON POOLS OF DETRITAL MATERIAL, PHYTOPLANKTON FUNCTIONAL TYPES RANGING FROM PICOPLANKTON TO MICROPLANKTON, AND A SIZE-BASED ZOOPLANKTON PREDATOR GROUP. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN COMPONENTS WILL BE DETERMINED BY BOTH SIZE AND FUNCTIONAL ROLE, AND THE MODEL WILL BE FORCED BY GOM PHYSICAL CONDITIONS. WE WILL VALIDATE THE MODEL AGAINST GNATS DATA, AND TEST THE ABILITY OF REMOTELY-SENSED PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS, COUPLED WITH THE ECOSYSTEM MODEL, TO REPRODUCE THE OBSERVED DYNAMICS. WE WILL THEN USE THE MODEL TO TEST HYPOTHESES REGARDING THE FATE OF CARBON RESULTING FROM CLIMATE-DRIVEN CHANGES SUCH AS INCREASED PRECIPITATION AND TEMPERATURE. ANTICIPATED SCIENTIFIC OUTCOMES FROM THIS WORK WILL BE A) A LONGER DURATION, NASA-CENTRIC, COASTAL TIME SERIES THAT CAN RESOLVE CLIMATOLOGICAL PHENOMENA SPANNING TIME SCALES OF DAYS TO DECADES AND B) A COUPLED PHYSICAL/ECOSYSTEM MODEL BASED ON GNATS THAT USES REMOTELY-SENSED, SHIP AND AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE DATA TO CONSTRAIN THE MODEL AND TEST HYPOTHESES RELEVANT TO EACH PART OF THE GOM CARBON CYCLE AND THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE."

THE MERGED TWO-BAND/THREE-BAND ALGORITHM IS FUNDAMENTALLY A CASE I ALGORITHM; THAT IS, IT IS DESIGNED FOR AREAS WHERE SUSPENDED SEDIMENTS,RIVER-BORN SEDIMENTS OR COLORED DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OCEAN OPTICAL PROPERTIES. THE PIC ALGORITHM ACCOUNTS FOR 78% OF THE VARIANCE IN FIELD-MEASURED PIC AND THE STANDARD ERROR OF PIC DETERMINATIONS (COMPARED TO SHIPBOARD VALIDATION DATA) IS +/-0.08MMOL M^-3, COMPARABLE TO THE PIC CONCENTRATIONS FOUND IN OLIGOTROPHIC GYRES. BUT THERE IS STILL CONSIDERABLE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE PIC ALGORITHM. THESE STATISTICS CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED IF THE SATELLITE DATA ARE BINNED IN SPACE AND TIME (RELATIVELY EASY TO DO WITH SATELLITE DATA, BUT THIS OBVIOUSLY COMPROMISES TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION). IN CASE I WATERS, ERRORS IN THE ALGORITHM RESULT FROM: (A) THE CALCITE-SPECIFIC BACKSCATTERING CROSS-SECTION ATTRIBUTED TO COCCOLITHOPHORES; (B) ERRORS IN THE CHLOROPHYLL-DEPENDENT BACKSCATTERING ATTRIBUTED TO PHYTOPLANKTON; AND (C) PRESENCE OF OTHER SCATTERING MINERALS, SUCH AS BIOGENIC SILICA FROM DIATOM FRUSTULES, WHICH DO NOT SCATTER AS INTENSELY AS PIC, BUT NONETHELESS CAN CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANT OPTICAL BACKSCATTERING. I PROPOSE TO CONTINUE EVALUATING NEW DATA SETS FOR PIC (GENERATED FROM OTHER ONGOING STUDIES) IN ORDER TO REVISE PIC ALGORITHM COEFFICIENTS AND LOOK-UP TABLES. REGARDING THE FIRST SOURCE OF ERROR, I WILL FOCUS ON BETTER DEFINING THE BACKSCATTERING CROSS-SECTION OF CALCITE COCCOLITHS GEOGRAPHICALLY. IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR ESTIMATE OF THE BACKSCATTERING CROSS-SECTION FOR CALCITE COCCOLITHS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF THE PIC ALGORITHM. REGARDING THE SECOND SOURCE OF ERROR, I WILL EXPERIMENT WITH NEW ALGORITHMS FOR DERIVING CHLOROPHYLL CONCENTRATION (E.G., THE REFLECTANCE DIFFERENCING ALGORITHM OF HU ET AL., 2012). THIS WILL PROVIDE A BETTER DERIVATION OF THE BACKSCATTERING ASSOCIATED WITH CHLOROPHYLL CONTAINING PHYTOPLANKTON, WHICH, IN TURN, WILL ALLOW IMPROVED ESTIMATES OF PIC. THIS WORK WILL BE IN COLLABORATION WITH DR. CHUAMIN HU (UNIV. SOUTH FLORIDA). REGARDING THE THIRD SOURCE OF ERROR, I WILL CORRECT FOR THE PRESENCE OF BIOGENIC SILICA, WHICH IS UBIQUITOUS OVER THE GLOBE AND A POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT LIGHT SCATTERING CONTRIBUTOR IN ITS OWN RIGHT. MOREOVER, BIOGENIC SILICA CAN NOW BE ESTIMATED REMOTELY (BALCH ET AL., 2010). ACCOUNTING FOR THIS COMPONENT OF THE BACKSCATTERING SIGNAL WILL ALLOW BETTER ESTIMATES OF PIC BACKSCATTERING AND DERIVATION OF PIC CONCENTRATION. I WILL COMPARE ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION FOR BOTH MODIS AQUA AND MODIS TERRA SATELLITES AND PERFORM FULL ERROR ANALYSES OF THE REVISED ALGORITHM IN THE INTEREST OF PROVIDING SEAMLESS, CLIMATE-QUALITY, PIC DATA. ALTHOUGH THE FOCUS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS ON CONTINUITY OF THE TERRA AND AQUA PIC PRODUCT, THE ALGORITHM CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO VIIRS IMAGERY. DR. HOWARD GORDON (UNIV.

THIS WORK  HAS THREE CENTRAL OBJECTIVES:   A) PIC ALGORITHM IMPROVEMENTS:  THERE ARE SEVERAL SOURCES OF ERROR  WITHIN THE PIC ALGORITHM THAT NEED IMPROVEMENT: DERIVATION OF THE DIFFUSE ATTENUATION COEFFICIENT  USED IN THE MODEL, DETERMINATION OF THE COCCOLITH BACKSCATTERING CROSS-SECTION AND DERIVATION OF  THE BACKSCATTERING ATTRIBUTABLE TO PHYTOPLANKTON CHLOROPHYLL.  THIS PROPOSED WORK WILL INVESTIGATE  ALL THREE ASPECTS WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR AN IMPROVED VIIRS PIC ALGORITHM. THIS WORK ALSO WILL RESULT  IN AN UPDATED PIC ALGORITHM THEORETICAL BASIS DOCUMENT (ATBD).   B) PIC ALGORITHM EVALUATION:  THE  MAJOR CHALLENGE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF THE PIC ALGORITHM IN THE SUOMI NPP ERA IS THE STILL-LIMITED  SEA-TRUTH PIC DATA TAKEN SINCE THE LAUNCH OF NPP IN OCTOBER, 2011, AVAILABLE FOR PRODUCT  EVALUATION. THE PIC ALGORITHM HAS BEEN BASED ON AN EVER-INCREASING, BUT STILL RELATIVELY SMALL, SET  OF FIELD MEASUREMENTS (SMALL AS COMPARED TO THE CHLOROPHYLL VALIDATION DATA SET, WHICH CONTAINS  #tilde#350X MORE DATA SIMPLY BECAUSE MORE INVESTIGATORS HAVE SAMPLED IT FOR SEVERAL MORE DECADES).

THIS WORK WILL PROVIDE  COLLECTION/ANALYSIS OF OTHER VARIABLES, TOO: CHLOROPHYLL CONCENTRATION AND PARTICULATE ORGANIC  CARBON (POC), INHERENT OPTICAL PROPERTIES (IOPS; E.G. PARTICLE ABSORPTION AND SCATTERING) AND  APPARENT OPTICAL PROPERTIES (AOPS; FOR VALIDATING VIIRS NORMALIZED WATER-LEAVING RADIANCE  MEASUREMENTS), ALL IN SUPPORT OF THEIR EVALUATION AS VIIRS EDRS AND CDRS.  NASA WILL INCUR NO SHIP  TIME EXPENSES FOR THE FIELD WORK; ALL THREE CRUISES ARE PART OF THE ATLANTIC MERIDIONAL TRANSECT  PROGRAM, LONG SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF THE U.K.  C) CONTINUITY  OF THE PIC SCIENCE DATA PRODUCT:  THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO SEAMLESSLY TRANSITION THE  PIC SCIENCE DATA PRODUCT FROM THE EOS ERA TO THE SUOMI NPP ERA (AND ULTIMATELY TO THE JPSS AND PACE  ERAS).  CRITICAL IN THIS GOAL IS DEFINING THE ERROR BUDGETS OF THE VIIRS PIC ALGORITHM FOR  COMPARISON TO THE SAME PRODUCT DERIVED FROM MODIS AND TRACEABLE TO THE ATBD.

THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP A MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF MICROBIAL IRON OXIDATION USING COMPARATIVE GENOMICS AND TRANSCRIPTOMICS, AS WELL AS CONSTRAIN THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM BY ASSESSING THE DIVERSITY OF MECHANISMS CURRENTLY DISPLAYED BY MODERN FE-OXIDIZING BACTERIA. WITHIN THIS CONTEXT, A MAJOR TECHNICAL CHALLENGE WILL BE DEVELOPMENT OF A ROBUST PIPELINE FOR ANALYZING SINGLE CELL TRANSCRIPTOMES FROM BACTERIA. SINGLE CELL TRANSCRIPTOMICS IS A NOVEL APPROACH THAT WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION, NOT ONLY ABOUT THE GENETIC POTENTIAL OF UNCULTIVATED MICROBES, BUT ALSO ABOUT WHAT GENES THEY ARE ACTUALLY EXPRESSING, PROVIDING DIRECT INSIGHT TO IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS THE BACTERIA ARE CARRYING OUT. IN ADDITION, IN TARGETING A POORLY UNDERSTOOD METABOLISM LIKE FE-OXIDATION, TRANSCRIPTOMIC ANALYSIS MAY PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION AS TO THE SPECIFIC GENES OR GENE FAMILIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN ENERGY CONSERVATION FROM FE-OXIDATION. WHILE THE SINGLE CELL GENOMICS CENTER AT BIGELOW HAS PROVEN ITS SUCCESS AT ACQUIRING DNA AND GENOMIC SEQUENCES FROM SINGLE CELLS, THE ACQUISITION OF MRNA AND DETERMINATION OF MRNA SEQUENCES HAS NOT BEEN DONE BEFORE ON ENVIRONMENTAL MICROORGANISMS. THUS, THIS APPROACH WILL OFFER SEVERAL TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES THAT, IF SUCCESSFULLY MET, WILL GREATLY ENHANCE OUR CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND DIVERSE MICROBIAL METABOLISMS, INDEPENDENT OF OUR ABILITY TO CULTIVATE THE MICROBES RESPONSIBLE. IN ADDITION TO THIS SINGLE CELL TRANSCRIPTOMICS APPROACH, WORK WILL CONTINUE WITH THE EXPLORATION OF GENOMES FROM CURRENTLY AVAILABLE SINGLE AMPLIFIED GENOMES OF BOTH FRESHWATER AND MARINE FEOB, AS WELL AS ANALYSIS OF IN-SITU HABITATS USING MORE CONVENTIONAL METAGENOMIC AND METATRANSCRIPTOME METHODS. DUE TO THE UNIQUE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF THESE TWO MAJOR GROUPS OF FE-OXIDIZERS, THIS KIND OF COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS COULD WELL INFORM US ABOUT MODES OF MICROBIAL EVOLUTION RELATED TO IRON METABOLISM. THE FEOB ARE AN EXCELLENT GROUP OF MICROBES TO TEST THESE METHODS ON DUE TO THEIR UNIQUE PHYSIOLOGY, DIVERSE, BUT CONSERVED PHYLOGENY AND EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY, AS WELL THERE BEING A GROUP OF CULTURED REPRESENTATIVES WITHIN A MUCH LARGER GROUP OF UNCULTIVATED MEMBERS. THIS PROJECT COULD CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO ADVANCING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR BIOLOGY, AND, PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY PROVIDE NEW TOOLS FOR ASTROBIOLOGISTS, AND OTHER MICROBIAL ECOLOGISTS AND PHYSIOLOGISTS INTERESTED IN LEARNING ABOUT NOVEL MICROBIAL PROCESSES."

IN MARINE AND COASTAL SYSTEMS, MANY KEY ECOLOGICAL EVENTS MIGRATIONS, REPRODUCTION, AND EXPLOITATION OF BLOOMS RELY ON THE PHENOLOGY OF THE UNDERLYING ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES. THE SOCIOECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THESE ECOSYSTEMS DERIVED FROM NATURAL RESOURCE EXTRACTION/PROCESSING AND RECREATION TOURISM ARE ALSO CLOSELY TIED TO THE TIMING OF SEASONAL EVENTS. CHANGES IN TIMING CAN OFTEN BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN CHANGES IN MAGNITUDE TO THE AFFECTED ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES.  THERE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES OF PHENOLOGICAL CLIMATE INDICATORS IN THE NATIONAL CLIMATE ASSESSMENT, BUT THERE IS A NEED TO INCORPORATE PHENOLOGY INTO CLIMATE ASSESSMENTS MORE BROADLY. WE PROPOSE A STUDY THAT IDENTIFIES KEY PHENOLOGICAL PROPERTIES AND ANALYZES HOW THEY VARY OVER REGIONAL AND OCEAN BASIN SCALES, EVALUATES THESE INDICES AGAINST IMPORTANT ECOLOGICAL SHIFTS TO DETERMINE A SUBSET OF PHENOLOGICAL INDICES THAT ARE MOST INFORMATIVE TO SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT, AND DEVELOPS INTERACTIVE VISUALIZATION TOOLS FOR VIEWING PHENOLOGICAL INFORMATION.  BASIN AND REGIONAL SCALE ANALYSIS OF PHENOLOGICAL TIME SERIES. FOR SOME MEASUREMENTS, EXTRACTING PHENOLOGICAL INDICES IS FAIRLY STRAIGHT FORWARD, SUCH AS THE DATE OF MAXIMUM WARMING. HOWEVER, SOME MEASUREMENTS, SUCH AS OCEAN COLOR, HAVE EXHIBITED COMPLEX SHIFTS IN PHENOLOGICAL PATTERNS, SUCH AS THE DIVISION OF ONE SEASONAL PEAK INTO MULTIPLE SEASONAL PEAKS. IN SUCH CASES, SIMPLE INDICES WILL NOT EFFECTIVELY REPRESENT THE PHENOLOGY. WE WILL DEVELOP AND TEST ROBUST ANALYTICAL METHODS FOR IDENTIFYING AND QUANTIFYING KEY PHENOLOGICAL PROPERTIES THAT CAN BE APPLIED GENERALLY TO NON STATIONARY TIME SERIES WITH BOTH SIMPLE AND COMPLEX SEASONAL PATTERNS.

SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL EVALUATE HOW OCEAN PHENOLOGY INDICATORS RELATE TO CHANGES IN SPAWNING MIGRATION TIMING OF ANADROMOUS FISH, INCLUDING SALMON, RIVER HERRING, AND STRIPED BASS. THESE SPECIES ARE IMPORTANT ECOLOGICAL LINKS IN MARINE ECOSYSTEMS, AND MANY SUSTAIN VALUABLE FISHERIES. MANY POPULATIONS ARE THREATENED OR ENDANGERED, SO THERE IS SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN UNDERSTANDING HOW ANADROMOUS SPECIES ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS. WE WILL ASSESS THE PHENOLOGICAL INDICES POTENTIAL FOR PROVIDING EARLY WARNING FOR KEY PHENOLOGICAL SHIFTS.   VISUALIZATION TOOLS FOR PHENOLOGICAL SERIES OF GEOSPATIAL DATA. COMMUNICATING TEMPORAL PROPERTIES ACROSS SPATIAL FIELDS CAN BE CHALLENGING. WITH INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS, DATA PRODUCTS WILL BE DEVELOPED TO VISUALIZE AND COMMUNICATE THE PHENOLOGICAL INDICES.

A FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE IS TO PREDICT WHETHER NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION (NETPP) IN THIS REGION WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE UNDER CHANGING NORTHERLY AND SOUTHERLY ADVECTIVE FLOWS. HERE, WE SUGGEST THAT THE BALANCE WILL DEPEND ON REGIONAL BOTTOM-UP DRIVERS (E.G., STRATIFICATION, NUTRIENT AND LIGHT AVAILABILITY, COMMUNITY COMPOSITION) AND TOP-DOWN DRIVERS (E.G., GRAZING). A GROWING UNDERSTANDING OF THE SURFACE AND DEEP OVERFLOWS, COUNTERFLOWS, AND RECIRCULATION PATTERNS WITHIN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC IS EMERGING THAT INDICATES STRONGER INFLUENCES OF THE ATLANTIC SURFACE WATER (AW) AND ARCTIC-ORIGIN WATER (ARW) ON EACH OTHER AND ON THE AVERAGE CIRCULATION PATTERNS WITHIN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. WE DEFINE THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC AS THE REGION ENCOMPASSED BY THE GREENLAND-ICELAND-NORWEGIAN (GIN), IRMINGER AND LABRADOR SEAS, WHERE WARMER AND SALTIER AW LADEN WITH NUTRIENTS, PLANKTON AND DETRITUS MOVES NORTH IN MULTIPLE BRANCHES INTO THE LABRADOR SEA, INTO THE GIN SEAS AND, EVENTUALLY, INTO THE ARCTIC OCEAN. FRESHER AND COLDER ARW WITH SEA ICE, LOW NUTRIENTS, LOW PLANKTON AND HIGH COLORED DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER MOVES SOUTHWARDS ALONG THE EDGE OF THE EASTERN GREENLAND AND WESTERN LABRADOR SEAS AND INTO THE N. ATLANTIC. HERE, WE WILL FOCUS ON THE BALANCE OF NETPP IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC AS AFFECTED BY (I) ADVECTIVE LOSSES AND GAINS WITHIN THIS REGION AT LARGE-SCALES INTERACTION WITH RESPECT TO BOUNDARY CONDITIONS IN THE TEMPERATE N. ATLANTIC AND ARCTIC OCEANS; (II) LATERAL AND VERTICAL EXPORT PRODUCTION WITHIN SUB-REGIONS OF THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC AT INTERMEDIATE SCALES; AND (III) ADVECTIVE AND LOCAL PROCESSES CONTROLLING NETPP IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC REGION. OUR QUESTIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: (Q1) WHAT BOTTOM-UP (PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL) FACTORS CONTROL THE NETPP LEVELS IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC, WHERE AND WHEN? (Q2) WHAT ARE THE CONTROLS OF SEASONAL AND SUB-SEASONAL VARIABILITIES AND TRENDS IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC? (Q3) WHAT IS THE BALANCE BETWEEN LOCAL AND ADVECTED NETPP IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC DURING THE GROWTH SEASON? WE PROPOSE TO USE A HIERARCHY OF MODELS INCLUDING A FULL 3D, COUPLED, BIOGEOCHEMICAL-PHYSICAL MODEL AT REGIONAL SCALE (SINMOD) AND A SPECIALIZED 1D SATELLITE OCEAN COLOR MODEL FOR PHYTOPLANKTON NETPP (UQAR-TAKUVIK), BOTH OF WHICH ARE EXCEPTIONALLY WELL TUNED TO HIGH LATITUDES. MODEL SIMULATIONS WILL BE DONE IN CONCERT WITH MINING HISTORICAL FIELD AND SATELLITE DATA TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF NETPP AND ITS PHYSICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CONTROLS OVER AN AVERAGE ANNUAL CYCLE IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC. OUR RESULTS WILL SHED LIGHT IF THE MAGNITUDE OF NETPP WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE DUE TO ENHANCED STRATIFICATION (WARMER AW OR FRESHER ARW CONDITIONS, LESS NUTRIENTS) AND GRAZING (IMMIGRATING OR RETURNING ZOOPLANKTON). ALTERNATIVELY, LESS SEA ICE IN FRAM STRAIT AND THE GREENLAND SEA MAY RESULT IN MORE AND EARLIER OPEN WATERS AND LESS STRATIFICATION THAT MAY LEAD TO HIGHER NETPP VALUES, AS HAS BEEN PREDICTED NORTH AND EAST OF SPITSBERGEN. A NORTHWARDS SHIFT IN NETPP DUE TO ENHANCED AW ADVECTION IS EXPECTED.

COASTAL OCEANS CONTRIBUTE ABOUT 1/3 OF THE TOTAL MARINE PRODUCTIVITY ACROSS THE GLOBE (OR ABOUT 16 PG (1PG =1E15G)). THEY RECEIVE ABOUT 1PG FROM TERRESTRIAL DISCHARGE VIA RIVERS. THEY CONTRIBUTE ABOUT HALF OF THE TOTAL GLOBAL OCEAN NEW PRODUCTION (3.6PG). THESE ARE BIG NUMBERS YET WE STILL DO NOT KNOW WHETHER COASTAL MARGINS ARE NET SOURCES OR SINKS FOR CARBON. THERE ARE FOUR COMPONENTS OF THE CARBON CYCLE PARTICULATE ORGANIC CARBON (POC), PARTICULATE INORGANIC CARBON (PIC), DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC), AND DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON (DIC). THE FIRST THREE CARBON FRACTIONS (POC, PIC, AND DOC) CAN BE ESTIMATED USING OPTICAL PROXIES WHILE THE FOURTH (DIC, ASSOCIATED WITH OCEAN ACIDIFICATION) IS BEST MEASURED CHEMICALLY. THERE ARE FEW COASTAL TIME SERIES THAT ASSESS ALL OF THESE COMPONENTS. THIS PROPOSAL IS A SUCCESSOR PROPOSAL FOR THE GULF OF MAINE NORTH ATLANTIC TIME SERIES (GNATS), AN 18-YEAR TRANSECT TIME SERIES ACROSS THE GULF OF MAINE (GOM) USING FERRIES, SMALL RESEARCH VESSELS, AND GLIDERS TO MEASURE ALL FOUR PARTS OF THE CARBON CYCLE. DURING SEVERAL ANOMALOUSLY WET YEARS, GNATS DOCUMENTED SOME FUNDAMENTAL SHIFTS IN THE GOM SUCH AS SIGNIFICANT DROPS IN PRIMARY PRODUCTION (ASSOCIATED WITH POC AND PIC PRODUCTION) AND THE APPEARANCE OF UNEXPECTED HIGHLY SCATTERING PARTICLES<0.2UM DIAMETER (HENCE DOC), WELL OUT TO SEA. WE HAVE ALSO OBSERVED WINTER DIC CONCENTRATIONS ACROSS THE GOM, LOW ENOUGH THAT THE ENTIRE GOM CAN SHOW LOW ARAGONITE SATURATION VALUES<1.6 LEVELS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE INHIBITORY TO CALCIFICATION BY CERTAIN MARINE ORGANISMS. HERE WE ARE PROPOSING TO (A) CONTINUE THE GNATS FOR THREE YEARS WITH EIGHT CRUISES PER YEAR (SIX ABOARD A COMMERCIAL FERRY AND TWO ABOARD A SMALL RESEARCH VESSEL) FOCUSING ON THE FOUR PARTS OF THE GOM CARBON CYCLE, (B) FURTHER VALIDATE SATELLITE OCEAN-COLOR SENSORS FOR RADIANCE AND OTHER PRODUCTS IN THIS COMPLEX OPTICAL ENVIRONMENT, (C) MAKE GNATS INTO AN EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATORY BY TESTING A RANGE OF HYPOTHESES ON CHANGING PRODUCTIVITY AND THE SOURCE OF SUBMICRON SCATTERING PARTICLES, (D) CONSTRUCT CARBON CYCLE MODELS OF THE GOM BASED ON BIOGEOCHEMICAL FLUXES AND ALLOMETRIC SCALING PERFORMING MODEL INTERCOMPARISON AND HYPOTHESIS TESTING USING THE MODELS, AND (E) CONTINUE A COLLABORATION IN WHICH WE ARE DEPLOYING AN ABOVE-WATER LIDAR (LIGHT DETECTION AND RANGING) FROM THE GNATS, ASSESSING THE LIDAR''S ABILITY TO PROFILE OPTICAL PROPERTIES DEEPER THAN ONE OPTICAL DEPTH. WE INCLUDE PREVIOUS RESULTS DEMONSTRATING THAT WE CAN TRACK WATER MASSES USING TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY, THEN DOCUMENT CO-VARYING CHANGES IN POC (BASED ON AN OPTICAL PROXY TO PARTICLE BACKSCATTERING), OXYGEN, AND CHLOROPHYLL IN THESE WATER MASSES; THESE ALLOW THE ESTIMATION OF NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION (NPP) AND NET COMMUNITY PRODUCTION. WE ALSO SHOW HOW ALLOMETRIC SCALING MODELS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THESE ESTIMATIONS. WE ARE REQUESTING FUNDS TO UPGRADE ONE OF OUR SLOCUM GLIDERS TO CARRY A SUNA NITRATE SENSOR THAT WILL ALLOW US TO MORE ACCURATELY ESTIMATE NITRATE DEPLETION AND NPP. THESE GLIDER RESULTS WILL ALLOW US TO BETTER DISCERN AND QUANTIFY WHETHER THE GOM IS A NET SOURCE OR SINK FOR CARBON. ALONG WITH A WHOLE HOST OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES, GNATS PROVIDES CRITICAL INSIGHTS ABOUT THE MAJOR PROCESSES AFFECTING ALL ASPECTS OF THE CARBON CYCLE IN THIS TEMPERATE COASTAL REGION: CHANGES IN PRODUCTIVITY, HYDROGRAPHY, PHYTOPLANKTON FUNCTIONAL GROUPS, LAND-SEA CARBON TRANSPORT CAUSED BY MAJOR RIVERINE FLOOD EVENTS AND DROUGHTS, PLUS POTENTIAL CHANGES DUE TO OCEAN ACIDIFICATION. SUCH RESULTS WILL PROVIDE INSIGHTS TO OTHER TEMPERATE COASTAL ZONES AROUND THE GLOBE. SIMPLY PUT, A SUSTAINED, COMBINED MEASUREMENT AND MODELING APPROACH, SUCH AS THE KIND WE ARE PROPOSING HERE, IS THE OPTIMAL WAY FOR NASA TO PREDICT CHANGES TO ALL FOUR PARTS OF THE MARINE CARBON CYCLE AS A FUNCTION OF LONG-TERM CLIMATE CHANGE IN THIS COMPLEX COASTAL Z"

RECENT DISCOVERIES BY THE KEPLER MISSION AND GROUND-BASED SURVEYS HAVE SHOWN THAT DYNAMICALLY STABLE PLANETARY SYSTEMS EXIST AND ARE ABUNDANT AROUND MANY BINARY STARS. FUTURE MISSIONS, SUCH AS TESS AND PLATO, WILL DISCOVER NEARBY PLANETS IN BINARY SYSTEMS, WHICH COULD BE FURTHER CHARACTERIZED SPECTROSCOPICALLY WITH JWST. THE RECENTLY LAUNCHED GAIA ASTROMETRY TELESCOPE, WHICH OBSERVES 1 BILLION STARS IN OUR GALAXY (1% OF THE GALACTIC STELLAR POPULATION), IS PROVIDING UNPRECEDENTED POSITIONAL AND RADIAL VELOCITY MEASUREMENTS THAT CAN REVEAL FURTHER PLANETS IN BINARY SYSTEMS. AS WITH PLANETS AROUND SINGLE STARS, THESE PLANETS IN BINARY SYSTEMS CONTINUE TO RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR POTENTIAL HABITABILITY. PREVIOUS STUDIES OF THE HABITABLE ZONE (HZ) OF BINARY SYSTEMS CONSIDERED ONLY THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN THE PEAK OF THE COMBINED SPECTRAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTION (SED) OF THE TWO STARS; HOWEVER, THE SPECTRAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTION (SED) FOR PLANETS IN BINARY SYSTEMS SHOULD BE A SUPERPOSITION OF BOTH HOST STARS. HABITABILITY IS DEFINED AS THE ABILITY OF A TERRESTRIAL PLANET TO SUSTAIN LIQUID WATER ON ITS SURFACE, WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE ENERGY BALANCE OF A PLANET S ATMOSPHERE. GREENHOUSE GASES LIKE WATER VAPOR AND CARBON DIOXIDE ABSORB RADIATION AT BOTH LONG (INFRARED) AND SHORT (ULTRAVIOLET) WAVELENGTHS, WHICH MAKES THE CLIMATE SENSITIVE TO THE FULL COMBINED SED OF BOTH STARS. WE EXPECT THAT THE HZ FOR PLANETS IN BINARY SYSTEMS SHOULD BE A FUNCTION OF THE SED OF THE BINARY SYSTEM, WHICH WILL DEPEND UPON THE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF EACH STELLAR SYSTEM. WE WILL ALSO STUDY THE DIFFERENCES IN DIURNAL PATTERNS OF SOLAR INSOLATION CAUSED BY BOTH P-TYPE AND S-TYPE PLANETARY ORBITS WITHIN BINARY SYSTEMS. WE EXPECT THE ORBITAL CONFIGURATIONS OF BINARY SYSTEMS TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE DEFINITION OF HABITABLE ZONES. METHODS THIS RESEARCH WILL CONSTRAIN THE HZ FOR PLANETS IN BINARY SYSTEMS BY USING A HIERARCHY OF EXISTING CLIMATE MODELS. WE WILL USE OBSERVED STELLAR SPECTRA AND STELLAR EVOLUTIONARY MODELS TO DEVELOP SEVERAL SCENARIOS FOR THE COMBINED SED OF BOTH P-TYPE AND S-TYPE BINARY SYSTEMS. WE WILL FIRST STUDY THE EFFECT OF SUPERPOSITION OF MULTIPLE STELLAR SPECTRA USING A LINE-BY-LINE RADIATIVE TRANSFER MODEL. THESE CALCULATIONS WILL SET BENCHMARKS FOR EVALUATION OF THE CORRELATED-K RADIATIVE TRANSFER CODES USED SUBSEQUENTLY. WE WILL THEN EVALUATE THE HZ FOR BINARY SYSTEM IN COMBINATIONS OF F, G, K, AND M TYPES USING A ONE-DIMENSIONAL RADIATIVE CONVECTIVE CLIMATE MODEL, WHICH WILL PROVIDE A BASIS OF COMPARISON AGAINST CLASSIC SINGLE-STAR HZ CALCULATIONS IN THE LITERATURE. WE WILL NEXT USE THIS 1-D MODEL TO PARAMETERIZE THE RADIATIVE TRANSFER IN A 2-D LATITUDINAL ENERGY BALANCE MODEL, WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO CONSIDER THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO HABITABILITY OF NON-CIRCULAR ORBITS AND ICE-ALBEDO FEEDBACK. WE WILL THEN EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF BINARY SED ON ATMOSPHERIC DYNAMICS BY USING FULL THREE-DIMENSIONAL GENERAL CIRCULATION MODELS TO QUANTIFY CHANGES IN LARGE-SCALE CIRCULATION THAT AFFECT HABITABILITY. BY USING THESE 3-D MODELS, WE CAN SELF-CONSISTENTLY SIMULATE ALL ASPECTS OF CLIMATE, WHICH INCLUDES GEOPHYSICAL AND ORBITAL PROPERTIES, RADIATIVE TRANSFER, DYNAMICS, AND CLOUDS. RELEVANCE THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH IS RELEVANT TO NASA S HABITABLE WORLDS PROGRAM AS A THEORETICAL STUDY OF THE CLIMATES OF EXTRASOLAR TERRESTRIAL PLANETS AND THEIR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN THE PRESENCE OF WATER. THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH WILL HELP  TO IDENTIFY THE CHARACTERISTICS AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF POTENTIALLY HABITABLE ENVIRONMENTS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND BEYOND  (C.4-1) BY USING A HIERARCHY OF EXISTING CLIMATE MODELS TO CONSTRAIN THE HZ OF PLANETS IN BINARY STAR SYSTEMS. THE SCOPE OF THIS RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE HABITABILITY OF EXTRASOLAR PLANETS, SO THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT RELEVANT TO THE EMERGING WORLDS PROGRAM, THE EXOBIOLOGY PROGRAM, OR ANY EXISTING DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAMS."

A FUNDAMENTAL GOAL IN THE STUDY OF THE ORIGIN OF LIFE IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW METABOLISM EMERGED IN THE PREBIOTIC ENVIRONMENT. THIS PROPOSAL IS ROOTED IN THE SEARCH TO EXPLAIN THE PREBIOTIC ORIGIN OF METABOLIC INTERMEDIATES IN A CITRIC ACID CYCLE-TYPE PREDECESSOR. THE PROPOSAL FOLLOWS ON A RECENT REPORT ON THE DETECTION OF MANY (NON-ENZYMATIC) CITRIC ACID CYCLE INTERMEDIATES IN CARBONACEOUS METEORITES AND, SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE LABORATORY DEMONSTRATION THAT PYRUVATE (A CITRIC ACID CYCLE PRECURSOR) LEADS TO THE FORMATION OF SEVERAL OF THESE KEY COMPOUNDS WITHOUT ENZYMES. HOWEVER, THE CHEMICAL MECHANISMS OF HOW SUCH ABIOTIC REACTIONS PROCEED ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN. THE PROPOSED WORK INVOLVES DETAILED LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS AND WILL (1) ATTEMPT TO ELUCIDATE THE CHEMICAL MECHANISMS OF PYRUVATE CHEMISTRY THAT LEAD TO OXALOACETATE, MALATE, FUMARATE, AND OTHER CITRIC ACID CYCLE COMPOUNDS AND (2) PERFORM QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES OF THE CORRESPONDING METEORITIC COMPOUNDS. METEORITIC ANALYSES WILL ALSO INCLUDE SEARCHES FOR (AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF) INTERMEDIATES IN THE FORMATION OF THE ABOVE COMPOUNDS. IF THE MOLECULAR AND ABUNDANCE PROFILES OF THIS SUITE OF METEORITIC COMPOUNDS ARE CONSISTENT WITH LABORATORY PYRUVATE CHEMISTRY, THE RESULTS WOULD LEND EVIDENCE TO THE SUGGESTION THAT EARLY IN THE HISTORY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM PYRUVATE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF SEVERAL (CURRENTLY KNOWN) METABOLIC INTERMEDIATES. BY FOLLOWING THE TIME-COURSE OF ISOTOPE-LABELED LABORATORY REACTIONS THE STEADY STATE ABUNDANCES OF THE COMPOUNDS CAN ALSO BE ASSESSED, E.G., COULD RELATIVELY FRAGILE COMPOUNDS SUCH AS OXALOACETATE HAVE PERSISTENT LONG ENOUGH ON THE ANCIENT EARTH FOR INCORPORATION INTO PROTO-CELLS? THIS PROPOSAL WILL INVOLVE BOTH SYNTHETIC AND ANALYTICAL EXPERIMENTATION TO INVESTIGATE THE SCENARIO THAT PYRUVATE MAY HAVE BEEN THE PRECURSOR OF KEY METABOLIC INTERMEDIATES ON THE EARLY EARTH AS WELL AS EXTRATERRESTRIAL SETTINGS. THE MAJOR ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES WILL BE GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-MASS SPECTROMETRY (GC-MS), LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY-MS AND NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE (NMR). GC-ISOTOPE RATIO MASS SPECTROMETRY (GC-IRMS) WILL BE USED FOR COMPOUND-SPECIFIC ISOTOPE (13C) ANALYSIS IN YEAR THREE OF THE PROPOSAL. RELEVANCE OF PROPOSED WORK: INCLUDED IN NASA''S STRATEGIC PLAN IS THE OBJECTIVE OF UNDERSTANDING HOW LIFE BEGINS AND EVOLVES. CARBONACEOUS METEORITES PROVIDE THE ONLY RECORD YET AVAILABLE FOR THE LABORATORY STUDY OF A WIDE RANGE OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS THAT WERE PRESENT ON (DELIVERED TO) THE EARLY PLANETS. ORGANIC COMPOUNDS IN ANCIENT EXTRATERRESTRIAL BODIES ARE INDICATORS OF CHEMICAL PROCESSES THAT OCCURRED BEFORE THE DAWN OF LIFE AND POSSIBLY LEAD TO LIFE ITSELF. BY STUDYING CARBONACEOUS METEORITES AND THE FATE OF THEIR ORGANIC COMPOUNDS, WE START TO UNDERSTAND THE APPARENTLY GENERAL PROCESS OF CHEMICAL EVOLUTION OF MOLECULES FROM INTERSTELLAR SPACE TO THEIR INCORPORATION INTO PLANETESIMALS, I.E., OTHER SOLAR SYSTEMS. THIS INCREASES OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROCESSES IN THE DISTANT PAST (AND TODAY) THAT LEAD TO LIFE THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE."

THE DEVELOPED DESIGN CONSISTS OF THREE MODULES: A COGNITIVE ENGINE, A SOFTWARE-DEFINED RADIO (SDR)PLATFORM AND A RECONFIGURABLE RF FRONT-END. THE KEY MODULE THAT MAKES THE RADIO A WACR IS THE COGNITIVE ENGINE THAT ACTS AS THE BRAIN OF THE SYSTEM. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE II PROJECT IS TO PROTOTYPE A SPACE TELECOMMUNICATIONS RADIO SYSTEM (STRS)-COMPLIANT PLUG-N-PLAY COGNITIVE ENGINE, CALLED THE RADIOBOT 1.0, THAT CAN TRANSFORM ANY SUITABLY DESIGNED SDR IN TO A WACR. DURING PHASE II, BLUECOM WILL BUILD ON THE SUCCESS OF PHASE I TO DEVELOP A SUITE OF ALGORITHMS THAT WILL MAKE UP THE COGNITIVE ENGINE: ALGORITHMS FOR SPECTRUM KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITIONAND PROTOCOLS FOR COGNITIVE COMMUNICATIONS. THE LATTER WILL SPECIFICALLY BE AIMED AT NETWORKS FORMED BY CLUSTERS OF SMALLER SATELLITES SUCH AS CUBESATS. NEXT, THESE ALGORITHMS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ON AN FPGA SYSTEM-ON-CHIP (SOC). RADIOBOT 1.0 PROTOTYPE WILL BE COMPLETED BY DEVELOPING A PLUG-N-PLAY INTERFACE BETWEEN THE FPGA-IMPLEMENTED COGNITIVE ENGINE AND ANY STRS-COMPLIANT SDR. WACR TECHNOLOGY OPERATION WILL BE DEMONSTRATED BY INTEGRATING THIS RADIOBOT 1.0 COGNITIVE ENGINE WITH SUITABLE SDR PLATFORMS AND IN PARTICULAR THOSE THAT OPERATE IN KA BAND. BEYOND OBVIOUS BENEFITS TO NASA IN REALIZING AUTONOMOUS AND INTELLIGENT COMMUNICATION NETWORKS REQUIRED TO EXPLOIT THE FULL POTENTIAL OF NETWORKED CLUSTERS OF CUBESATS, RADIOBOT1.0 WILL ALSO FIND COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS IN FIRST-RESPONDER/EMERGENCY/PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS, AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS AND DRONES AS WELL AS MANY OTHER MILITARYCOMMUNICATIONS."

BLUHAPTICS HAS SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED BOTH THE FEASIBILITY AND POTENTIAL IMPACT OF USING OUR DEFT CONTROL SOFTWARE (DCS) TO PROVIDE PILOT ASSISTANCE TO ENABLE SAFE, INTUITIVE AND EFFICIENT REMOTE TELEOPERATION OF NASA S ROBOTIC SYSTEMS. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF OUR PHASE II EFFORT IS TO DEVELOP AND DELIVER A SOLUTION THAT ENABLES INTUITIVE TELE-ROBOTIC CONTROL IN DYNAMIC SCENARIOS, SUCH AS WHEN TARGETS AND POSSIBLY INTERFERING OBJECTS ARE MOVING IN THE WORKSPACE. THIS PROPOSED APPROACH COMBINES 3D SENSING AND NOVEL MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS WITH SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION AND MAPPING (SLAM) FOR WORKSPACE VISUALIZATION SLAM, TO OBTAIN REAL-TIME TRACKING THAT PROVIDES PILOT GUIDANCE. BY INCREASING SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND IMPLEMENTING SAFETY FEATURES SUCH AS COLLISION-AVOIDANCE, DCS CAN GARNER PILOT TRUST, IMPROVE SAFETY, MITIGATE TRAINING TIME AND SUPPORT RAPID TASK SWITCHING. WE WILL PERFORM PHYSICAL EXPERIMENTS AND TASK DEMONSTRATIONS USING TWO SEPARATE ROBOTIC PLATFORMS THAT ARE READILY AVAILABLE TO OUR TEAM: (1) MANTIS -- A COMPACT AND HIGHLY DEXTEROUS MANIPULATOR DESIGNED TO FIT INSIDE AN EXPRESSRACK LOCKER; AND (2) SCHILLING TITAN4 -- A WORK-CLASS HYDRAULIC MANIPULATOR COMMONLY USED IN OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS.

SINCE THE CURIOSITY ROVER LANDED IN GALE CRATER, A DIVERSE RANGE OF COMPOSITIONS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN IGNEOUS FLOAT ROCKS, SEDIMENTARY ROCKS, AND IGNEOUS CLASTS WITHIN SEDIMENTARY ROCKS THAT HAD NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED IN SITU ON MARS. THESE ROCKS EXHIBIT A VARIETY OF TEXTURES AND MINERALOGIES, AND HAVE BULK COMPOSITIONS RANGING FROM MAFIC TO FELSIC, WITH A RANGE OF ALKALI ENRICHMENTS. THESE RECENTLY OBSERVED COMPOSITIONS PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THE CRUST OF MARS IS NOT EXCLUSIVELY BASALTIC, BUT ALSO DISPLAYS FELSIC AND ALKALINE COMPOSITIONS.

CAREFUL DATA MINING WITH WELL-DEFINED SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES HOLDS THE KEY TO ADDRESS OPEN QUESTIONS IN GRB PHYSICS, SUCH AS JET COMPOSITION, RADIATION MECHANISM, PROGENITOR AND CENTRAL ENGINE PHYSICS. WE PROPOSE TO PERFORM DATA ANALYSES IN THE FOLLOWING THREE DIRECTIONS. 1. THE TIME RESOLVED GRB SPECTRA HAVE A DOMINANT COMPONENT THAT CAN BE FIT WITH A PHENOMENOLOGICAL ``BAND'''' FUNCTION. THE PHYSICAL MEANING OF THIS FUNCTION REMAINS UNCLEAR. RECENTLY WE MADE A BREAKTHROUGH IN THEORETICAL MODELING, AND SHOWED THAT FAST-COOLING SYNCHROTRON RADIATION OF ELECTRONS IN A DECREASING MAGNETIC FIELD CAN MIMIC THE BAND FUNCTION IN DETECTOR''S BANDPASS, BUT DIFFERS FROM BAND FUNCTION SLIGHTLY. WE PROPOSE TO APPLY THIS HYSICALLYMOTIVATED MODEL TO SYSTEMATICALLY FIT THE GRB PROMPT EMISSION DATA COLLECTED BY FERMI GBM AND LAT, AND TEST WHETHER THE DOMINANT GRB EMISSION MECHANISM IS FAST COOLING SYNCHROTRON RADIATION. WE WILL ALSO FIT TIME-DEPENDENT SPECTRA WITH A TIME-DEPENDENT MODEL TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER A QUASI-THERMAL \PHOTOSPHERE'''' EMISSION COMPONENT IS INDEED NEEDED TO FIT THE OBSERVED SPECTRA.

BY FITTING THE TIME RESOLVED SPECTRA, WE WILL ALSO CONSTRAIN IMPORTANT PHYSICAL PARAMETERS OF GRB PROMPT EMISSION, SUCH AS THE EMISSION SITE OF GRBS, THE STRENGTH OF MAGNETIC FIELDS, AS WELL AS THEIR EVOLUTION WITH RADIUS. 2. RECENT GRB MULTI-WAVELENGTH OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT IT IS NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD TO DEFINE THE PHYSICAL CATEGORY OF A GRB BASED ON THE TRADITIONAL CLASSIFICATION IN THE \""DURATION''''-\""HARDNESS'''' DOMAIN. SOME LONG-DURATION GRBS MAY NOT HAVE A MASSIVE STAR ORIGIN, WHILE SOME SHORT-DURATION GRBS MAY INSTEAD HAVE A MASSIVE STAR ORIGIN.

THE ANHYDROUS NATURE OF MERRILLITE HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN INTERPRETED AS EVIDENCE OF WATER-LIMITED LATE-STAGE MARTIAN MELTS.

CHARACTERIZE THE MINERALOGY OF SHOCKED AND UNSHOCKED SYNTHETIC WHITLOCKITE, MERRILLITE, AND NATURAL MARTIAN METEORITIC MERRILLITE, WITH A SUITE OF ANALYTICAL METHODS, INCLUDING ADVANCED METHODS SUCH AS SYNCHROTRON X-RAY DIFFRACTION, TO DETERMINE IF MARTIAN MERRILLITES CONTAIN ADDITIONAL PHASES, FOR EXAMPLE MONETITE, WHICH MAY BE INDICATORS OF PAST MINERALOGICAL CONDITIONS.

THIS CALL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROCESSES THAT AFFECT THE SURFACES, INTERIORS, ATMOSPHERES, EXOSPHERES, AND MAGNETOSPHERES OF PLANETARY BODIES.\ THE LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYTICAL STUDIES OF SYNTHETIC AND NATURAL MARS-RELEVANT MATERIALS THAT WE PROPOSE WILL IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROCESSES THAT AFFECT THE SURFACE AND INTERIOR OF MARS AND MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR PAST MARTIAN ATMOSPHERIC AND CLIMATOLOGICAL (I.E.

HARRIS, UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA THE LIFE HISTORY AND SYSTEMS BIOLOGY OF FUNGAL-ALGAL MUTUALISMS EXTREMOPHILES ARE WIDELY RECOGNIZED AS ORGANISMS THAT CAN LIVE IN ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE INHOSPITABLE TO MOST FORMS OF LIFE. THESE ENVIRONMENTS OFTEN EXHIBIT EXTREMES OF TEMPERATURE AS WELL AS WATER AVAILABILITY, AND MAY ALSO FEATURE UNUSUALLY HIGH LEVELS OF RADIATION, METALS, ACIDS, AND OTHER TOXIC COMPOUNDS. ALTHOUGH THE BEST STUDIED EXAMPLES OF EXTREMOPHILES ARE PROKARYOTIC, AN INCREASINGLY DIVERSE ARRAY OF EUKARYOTIC FUNGI HAVE BEEN FOUND THAT THRIVE IN EXTREME COLD, DRY, SALTY, OR ACIDIC HABITATS. EXTREMOPHILIC FUNGI POSSESS A NUMBER OF ADAPTATIONS THAT ENABLE THE COLONIZATION OF HARSH ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING THE ACCUMULATION OF PROTECTIVE PIGMENTS, SIMPLIFIED CELLULAR MORPHOLOGIES, AND VERY SLOW GROWTH. NEVERTHELESS, THERE IS MUCH THAT REMAINS TO BE UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THE LIFE HISTORY AND SYSTEMS BIOLOGY OF THESE FUNGI. WE PROPOSE TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT EXTREMOPHILIC FUNGI ENGAGE IN MUTUALISTIC ASSOCIATIONS WITH ALGAE (OR CYANOBACTERIA) TO SUPPORT THEIR COLONIZATION OF EXTREME HABITATS. IN PARTICULAR, THESE  TRANSIENT SYMBIOSES  PROVIDE AN ACCESSIBLE SOURCE OF NUTRITION AND MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO STRESS TOLERANCE. WE WILL TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS BY PURSUING TWO SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES. FIRST, WE WILL USE IMAGE ANALYSIS AND MICROSCOPY TO DETERMINE THE RELATIVE TIMING OF EVENTS UNDERLYING THE MUTUALISTIC ASSOCIATION OF THE EXTREMOPHILE FUNGUS EXOPHIALA DERMATITIDIS WITH THE ALGA CHLORELLA SOROKINIANA. TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROFILING AND BIOCHEMICAL ANALYSES WILL BE USED TO INVESTIGATE THE RESPONSES OF EACH PARTNER AS THEY INTERACT. SECOND, WE WILL EMPLOY CULTURE-BASED AND META-GENOMIC APPROACHES TO ASSESS THE DIVERSITY OF FUNGI AND ALGAE THAT COLONIZE ROCK SURFACES IN A BOREAL BIOME (PRE-CAMBRIAN SHIELD). ISOLATED FUNGI AND ALGAE WILL BE SYSTEMATICALLY TESTED FOR THE CAPACITY TO ENGAGE IN MUTUALISTIC ASSOCIATIONS. OUR PROPOSED RESEARCH FALLS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE NASA EXOBIOLOGY PROGRAM EMPHASIS AREA  EARLY EVOLUTION OF LIFE AND THE BIOSPHERE . FOR EXAMPLE, OUR RESULTS WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE PHYSIOLOGY OF EXTREMOPHILIC MICROORGANISMS THAT ARE ADAPTED TO ENVIRONMENTS THAT SHARE FEATURES IN COMMON WITH EARLY EARTH (AND PERHAPS OTHER PLANETS). NOTABLY, WE EXPECT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE CELLULAR SYSTEMS OF INTERACTING FUNGI AND ALGAE EVOLVE IN RESPONSE TO THESE ENVIRONMENTS. IN ADDITION, OUR RESULTS WILL ALSO SHED LIGHT ON HOW THE COMPOSITION OF MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES AND THEIR CONSTITUENT INTERACTIONS IMPACTS THE GEOCHEMISTRY OF ROCK SURFACES. FOR OUR FIRST OBJECTIVE, WE HAVE A DEVELOPED A PROTOCOL FOR THE SUCCESSFUL CO-CULTIVATION OF E. DERMATITIDIS WITH C. SOROKINIANA. RNA-SEQ WILL BE USED TO GENERATE TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROFILES AT MULTIPLE STAGES OF CO-CULTIVATION. THESE PROFILES WILL BE CORRELATED WITH MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF FUNGAL MORPHOLOGY AS WELL AS BIOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF FUNGAL LIPIDS. IN TOTAL, WE EXPECT THESE EXPERIMENTS TO PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHT INTO THE STRATEGIES EMPLOYED BY EXTREMOPHILE FUNGI TO ACQUIRE NUTRIENTS IN ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF EARLY EARTH. FOR OUR SECOND OBJECTIVE, WE WILL SAMPLE EXPOSED ROCK OUTCROPS AT THREE SPECIFIC LOCATIONS IN THE PRE-CAMBRIAN SHIELD OF CANADA. A ROUTINE CULTURE-BASED SELECTION WILL BE USED TO RECOVER EXTREMOPHILIC FUNGI AND ALGAE (OR CYANOBACTERIA) FROM ROCK SURFACES AS WELL AS FROM PULVERIZED FRAGMENTS. DNA SEQUENCE ANALYSIS WILL BE USED TO ESTABLISH THE IDENTITY OF EACH ISOLATE. IN PARALLEL, DNA EXTRACTED FROM PULVERIZED ROCKS WILL BE SEQUENCED TO PROVIDE A META-GENOMIC OVERVIEW OF FUNGAL AND ALGAL COMMUNITIES.

THREE TYPES OF METEOROLOGICAL FORCING IN THE FORECAST PERIOD WILL BE TESTED: (1) METEOROLOGICAL FIELDS DRAWN FROM GEOS-5 FORECAST AND DOWNSCALED TO NORTH AMERICAN LAND DATA ASSIMILATION SYSTEM PHASE 2 (NLDAS-2) RESOLUTION (12.5KM) THROUGH BAYESIAN MERGING WITH HISTORICAL NLDAS-2 FIELDS; (2) A HYBRID STATISTICAL-DYNAMICAL METEOROLOGICAL FORECAST GENERATED THROUGH ANALOG DOWNSCALING, IN WHICH LARGE SCALE ATMOSPHERIC FIELDS FROM THE GEOS-5 FORECAST ARE PATTERN-MATCHED TO DAYS IN THE HISTORIC GEOS-5 ARCHIVE AND METEOROLOGICAL FIELDS ARE DRAWN FROM NLDAS FOR THOSE ANALOG DATES; AND (3) AS THE CONTROL,  NULL FORECAST  SIMULATIONS THAT ARE DRIVEN BY CLIMATOLOGY IN THE FORECAST PERIOD. THE SIMULATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT GRACE DATA ASSIMILATION IN THE RETROSPECTIVE PERIOD IN ORDER TO GAUGE ITS IMPACT. FURTHER, WE WILL QUANTIFY THE CONTRIBUTION OF EACH ASPECT OF THE FORECAST SYSTEM MEMORY IN THE LAND SURFACE MODEL, GRACE DATA ASSIMILATION, GEOS-5 FORECAST METEOROLOGY, AND GEOS-5 FORECAST OF LARGE SCALE ATMOSPHERIC PATTERNS TO SKILLFUL PREDICTION OF DROUGHT AND FLOOD. THE BEST PERFORMING CONFIGURATION WILL BE USED FOR THE FINAL FORECAST SYSTEM. THE LOW LATENCY GRACE TERRESTRIAL WATER STORAGE DATA ARE A UNIQUE ASPECT OF THIS PROPOSAL THAT GREATLY INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR GRACE AND GRACE FO TO ADD VALUE TO THE FORECASTS. THEY WERE DEVELOPED UNDER THE DIRECTION OF ONE OF THE CO-INVESTIGATORS, AND WE HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TESTING THEM AS INPUTS TO OUR DROUGHT MONITORING PRODUCTS. OUR TEAM INCLUDES PARTNERS FROM NDMC, NOAA S NORTH CENTRAL RIVER FORECAST CENTER, AND THE U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, WHO WILL DISTRIBUTE, TEST, AND MAKE USE OF THE RESULTING 30-90 DAY FORECASTED, 0.125  GRIDDED GROUNDWATER, SOIL MOISTURE, SNOW, AND OTHER FIELDS AND ASSOCIATED WETNESS INDICATORS. CONSIDERING THE STRENGTH OF OUR TEAM, OUR CONNECTIONS TO THE BROADER DROUGHT, RIVER FLOW, AND FLOOD COMMUNITIES, AND OUR PAST SUCCESS IN DELIVERING HIGH QUALITY WETNESS INDICATORS WHICH HAVE BEEN EMBRACED BY THE DROUGHT COMMUNITY, WE BELIEVE THE FORECAST DATA THAT RESULT FROM THIS PROJECT WILL BE QUICKLY ADOPTED BY AND HIGHLY VALUABLE TO END USERS. IF THIS PROPOSAL IS FUNDED, WE WILL APPLY FOR SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT AN ASSESSMENT OF THE VALUE OF THE INFORMATION TO END USERS, TO BE LED BY OUR PARTNERS ON AN ONGOING NASA APPLIED SCIENCES PROGRAM PROJECT WHOSE GOAL IS TO DO THE SAME FOR OUR CURRENT SUITE OF DROUGHT INDICATORS."

USING NOVEL COMBINATIONS OF MODIS BANDS (INCLUDING NEW CHLOROPHYLL:CAROTENOID INDICES, CCIS), WE WILL DEVELOP A NEW LIGHT-USE EFFICIENCY (LUE) MODEL. 2.  THE NEW LUE MODEL TERMS AND PRODUCTS (E.G. GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY, GPP) WILL BE COMPARED TO GROUND VALIDATION SITES WHERE FLUX AND OPTICAL DATA ARE AVAILABLE. 3.  WE WILL COMPARE THE NEW LUE MODEL TO OTHER MODELS, INCLUDING THE BENCHMARK MOD17 GPP PRODUCTS AND EMERGING GPP PRODUCTS FROM SOLAR-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE (SIF) METHODS (OCO2 SATELLITE SENSOR). 4.  USING THESE METHODS, WE WILL EVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GROWING SEASON LENGTH AND PRODUCTIVITY TO INVESTIGATE REPORTED BROWNING AND GREENING AND THEIR CAUSES AND IMPLICATIONS FOR DIFFERENT ECOSYSTEMS WITHIN THE ABOVE DOMAIN.  METHODS/TECHNIQUES: TO ACCOMPLISH THESE OBJECTIVES, WE WILL USE SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS COUPLED WITH GROUND VALIDATION TO INVESTIGATE CHANGING GROWING SEASON LENGTH AND ITS IMPACT ON THE CARBON BUDGET OF BOREAL AND ARCTIC REGIONS. A PRIMARY APPROACH WILL BE TO DEVELOP A NEW LIGHT-USE EFFICIENCY (LUE) MODEL OF ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY, BASED ON A NEW COMBINATION OF SATELLITE INDICES PROVIDED BY REPROCESSED MODIS PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION TO STANDARD MODIS PRODUCTS (E.G. NDVI) WE WILL UTILIZE NEWLY AVAILABLE CHLOROPHYLL:CAROTENOID INDICES (CCIS, DERIVED FROM NOVEL COMBINATIONS OF MODIS TERRESTRIAL&OCEAN BANDS CAPABLE OF INVISIBLE PHOTOSYNTHETIC PHENOLOGY IN EVERGREENS). OUR INITIAL EOGRAPHIC FOCUS WILL BE ON BOREAL REGIONS WHERE PHOTOSYNTHETIC DOWN REGULATION RESTRICTS PHOTOSYNTHETIC ACTIVITY, WHICH HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WITH CONVENTIONAL MEANS. BY THE END OF THE PROJECT PERIOD, MODELING WILL SPAN THE FULL RANGE OF ECOSYSTEMS ACROSS THE ABOVE DOMAIN, AND VALIDATION WILL INVOLVE BOTH GROUND NETWORKS AND INDEPENDENT SATELLITE-BASED PRODUCTIVITY ESTIMATES.  TO VALIDATE SATELLITE SENSOR AND LUE MODEL PRODUCTS WITH GROUND OBSERVATIONS, WE WILL UTILIZE EXISTING DATA FROM AN EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF GROUND STATIONS, CONSISTING OF FLUX TOWER AND OPTICAL PHENOLOGY STATIONS SPANNING THE ABOVE DOMAIN AND COVERING A RANGE OF CONDITIONS AND ECOSYSTEM TYPES. VALIDATION WILL CONSIDER BOTH SATELLITE OPTICAL INDICES AND THEIR MODELED FLUX PRODUCTS, AND WILL EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF SPATIAL SCALE, SAMPLING ANGLE, SPECTRAL SCALE, AND TEMPORAL AGGREGATION ON THE INTERPRETATION OF OPTICAL SIGNALS.  GROUND VALIDATION WILL ALSO CLARIFY THE CONFOUNDING EFFECTS OF CLOUDS, SNOW, ICE, AND STANDING WATER ON KEY VEGETATION OPTICAL INDICES, INCLUDING NDVI AND CCIS. ADDITIONAL VALIDATION WILL COMPARE SATELLITE PRODUCTS (E.G. GPP) TO THE STANDARD MODIS GPP PRODUCT (MOD17) WITH INDEPENDENT ESTIMATES FROM OCO2 FLUORESCENCE PRODUCTS AND ATMOSPHERIC INVERSIONS AS THESE BECOME AVAILABLE.  SIGNIFICANCE: THIS STUDY ADDRESSES THE ABOVE TOPICS OF REPORTED GREENING AND BROWNING OF NORTHERN ECOSYSTEMS, AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN THE SATELLITE NDVI RECORD. THESE SATELLITE NDVI OBSERVATIONS HAVE SUGGESTED POTENTIALLY LARGE CHANGES IN BOREAL AND ARCTIC CARBON BUDGETS, BIOGEOCHEMISTRY, SURFACE-ATMOSPHERE FEEDBACKS, AND DISTURBANCE REGIMES, BUT CAN ALSO BE SUBJECT TO MISINTERPRETATION DUE TO THE OVER-DETERMINED NATURE OF SATELLITE INDICES. BY UTILIZING THE FULL RANGE OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM MODIS PRODUCTS, WE WILL ENHANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES BEYOND WHAT IS POSSIBLE FROM EXITING NDVI-BASED METHODS ALONE, AND LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE MODELING EFFORTS AND SATELLITE SENSORS HAVING IMPROVED SENSITIVITY TO SUBTLE VEGETATION CHANGE AND ITS UNDERLYING FUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE. THIS IMPROVED ASSESSMENT OF ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFECTIVE GROWING SEASON LENGTH ACROSS THE ABOVE DOMAIN WILL ALLOW BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CARBON BALANCE AND OTHER ECOSYSTEM FEEDBACKS TO THE ATMOSPHERE AND CLIMATE FOR NORTHERN ECOSYSTEMS. BY LINKING TO AN EXTENSIVE GROUND VALIDATION NETWORK, WE WILL ALSO ENHANCE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUTREACH AND COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION ACROSS THE ABOVE DOMAIN."

THE PAA TECHNICAL AREA IS FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE UNDERSTANDING AND QUANTIFICATION OF PAA EFFECTS, PREDICTION TOOL DEVELOPMENT, AND NOISE REDUCTION TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT THAT ARE RELATED TO THE AEROACOUSTIC EFFECTS OF PROPULSION AND AIRFRAME INTEGRATION.    PAA NOISE REDUCTION TECHNOLOGY AIMS TO REDUCE NET RADIATED NOISE TO THE GROUND BY REDUCING A NOISE SOURCE OR AN INTERACTION OF NOISE SOURCES THAT CAN BE DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTED TO EFFECTS OF PROPULSION AIRFRAME INTEGRATION.    NASAS ERA PROJECT HAS A GOAL OF DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY TO MEET AN AIRCRAFT NOISE GOAL OF 42 DECIBEL (DB) BELOW THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATIONS (FAAS) STAGE 4 CUMULATIVE CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENT.  THE HYBRID WING BODY (HWB) AIRCRAFT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ONE CONCEPT THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO MEET THE AIRCRAFT NOISE GOAL.  THIS STATEMENT IS BASED ON CONSIDERABLE RECENT RESEARCH INCLUDING RESULTS FROM PREVIOUS TASKS WITH BOEING.  NASA PUBLISHED IN AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF AERONAUTICS AND ASTRONAUTICS (AIAA) PAPER 2010-3913 RESULTS SHOWING A TECHNICAL PATH FOR A HWB CONCEPT TO MEET THE 42 DB GOAL.  THIS STUDY INCLUDED EXPERIMENTAL DATA ACQUIRED ON THE LARC CONTRACT NNL04AA11B, TASK ORDER NNL05AD23T TO BOEING AND PUBLISHED IN AIAA 2010-3912.  A CONTRACT WAS ALSO AWARDED TO BOEING AS A RESULT OF THE 2007 SUBSONIC FIXED WING PROJECTS ROUND 2 NASA RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENT (NRA).  THAT NRA AWARD TO BOEING (I.E., NNL07AA54C) RESULTED IN THE BOEING DESIGN OF A HWB AIRCRAFT CONCEPT TERMED THE N2A AND THE FABRICATION OF A WIND TUNNEL MODEL BASED ON THE N2A, THE QUIET-R1.  THE QUIET-R1 WILL BE TESTED IN THE NASA LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTERS 14 BY 22 SUBSONIC WIND TUNNEL IN FY 2012 IN ORDER TO VALIDATE THE 42 DB NOISE GOAL AMONG OTHER OBJECTIVES.   A KEY TO THE HWBS POTENTIAL TO MEET THE NOISE GOAL IS A SUCCESSFUL PAA STRATEGY FOR REDUCING THE JET NOISE COMPONENT OF THE TOTAL AIRCRAFT NOISE.  THIS STRATEGY INCLUDES LOW FREQUENCY JET NOISE REDUCTION AND REDISTRIBUTION OF THE PEAK JET NOISE SOURCES SO THAT NOISE WILL BE REDUCED SUBSTANTIALLY BY SHIELDING FROM A LIMITED AIRFRAME SURFACE AFT OF THE NOZZLE EXIT PLANE.  THIS STRATEGY IS IMPLEMENTED BY DEVELOPMENT OF A NOZZLE AND PYLON(S) CONFIGURATION. THIS PAA STRATEGY WAS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED SUCCESSFULLY UNDER TASK ORDER NNL05AD23T AWARDED TO BOEING.  HOWEVER, THAT DEMONSTRATION WAS FOR A LOWER BYPASS RATIO (7) ENGINE TYPE.  FOR SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION TO THE HIGHER BYPASS RATIO (10) ENGINE TYPE ON THE N2A, THIS PAA STRATEGY REQUIRES APPLICATION OF WHAT WAS LEARNED IN TASK ORDER NNL05AD23T TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF THE CONFIGURATION AND INTEGRATION OF THE NOZZLE AND PYLON(S) THAT WILL PRODUCE THE DESIRED RESULT ON THE ENGINE TYPE OF THE N2A.  IT IS THIS DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION THROUGH A DESIGN, FABRICATION, AND TEST PROCESS THAT IS THE PRIMARY SUBJECT OF THIS TASK ORDER.    2.0 	SCOPE / OBJECTIVE(S):  THE SCOPE OF THIS TASK ORDER IS TO BUILD UPON RESEARCH CONDUCTED UNDER LARC CONTRACT NNL04AA11B, TASK ORDER NNL05AD23T, HAVING DEVELOPED AND DEMONSTRATED THE CAPABILITIES AND EXPERTISE FOR PAA PYLON/NOZZLE INTEGRATION THROUGH MODEL SCALE DESIGN, FABRICATION, AND EXPERIMENTATION.

SINCE THE NESC COMPOSITE CREW MODULE PROJECT WAS PERFORMED ON A SCHEDULE THAT WAS ACCELERATED FROM THE ORION PROJECT, LOADS AND INTERFACES WERE INCORPORATED AND FROZEN IN JUNE 2007.  THUS SOME OF THE LOADS AND INTERFACES ON CCM TODAY ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH TODAYS VERSION OF THE ORION CREW MODULE.  DURING THE DESIGN PHASE OF THE CCM PROJECT, THE ORION PROJECT OFFICE EXPRESSED CONCERNS WITH THE NESC RATIONALE FOR MANAGING LEAKAGE THROUGH THE COMPOSITE MATERIAL SYSTEM.  AT THAT TIME, THE TECHNICAL SOLUTION WAS TO USE AUTOCLAVE CURED SANDWICH SKINS WITH UN-VENTED CORE, PROVIDING TWO UNIQUE BARRIERS TO LEAKAGE THROUGH THE SANDWICH SYSTEM.  THERE WERE CONCERNS IDENTIFIED WITH THAT RATIONALE IN THAT UNDETECTABLE DAMAGE COULD CAUSE MICRO-CRACKING OF THE LAMINATE IN THE SKINS, RESULTING IN A COMPROMISED FIRST LAYER.  COINCIDENT DAMAGE ON THE SECOND LAYER WOULD RESULT IN AN UNDETECTABLE LEAK PATH.  GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ATTACHMENTS ON BOTH THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR OF THE CREW MODULE STRUCTURE, THE POSSIBILITY OF UNDETECTED DAMAGE IS PRESENT, AND THEREFORE THE LEAK MANAGEMENT RATIONALE AS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED WAS NOT ACCEPTED.  DURING THE MANUFACTURING PHASE OF THE CCM, A HIGHLY FLEXIBLE MEMBRANE WAS IDENTIFIED THAT COULD BE INSTALLED ON THE INTERIOR OF THE CCM USING A PRESSURE SENSITIVE ADHESIVE.  THIS MEMBRANE HAS A CAPACITY FOR LARGE ELONGATION SO THAT IT CAN BE STRETCHED OVER IRREGULAR SHAPES, SUCH AS BOLTS, AS WELL AS CONFORM TO ODD SHAPES AND SURFACES.

DEVELOPMENT OF IMPROVED PREDICTION METHODS AND TECHNOLOGIES FOR A REDUCED NOISE SIGNATURE IS, THEREFORE, ONE OF THE IMPORTANT FOCAL AREAS FOR THE PROJECT.  TO THAT END, THE PROJECT STRATEGY INCLUDES PROVISIONS FOR NOVEL TEST METHODS AND VALIDATED PREDICTION TOOLS THAT CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE SYSTEM TRADEOFFS FOR ADVANCED CONCEPTS CAPABLE OF MEETING LONGER-TERM NOISE GOALS.  SPECIFICALLY, FOUNDATIONAL RESEARCH IS PERFORMED IN THE PROJECT TO ESTABLISH VALIDATION DATA FOR COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS AND TO DEVELOP NOISE PREDICTION AND REDUCTION TECHNOLOGIES FOR PROPULSIVE (I.E., ENGINE RELATED) AND AIRFRAME NOISE SOURCES.WITH THE ADVENT OF QUIETER, ULTRA-HIGH-BYPASS-RATIO ENGINES, FLOW UNSTEADINESS IN THE VICINITY OF VARIOUS AIRFRAME COMPONENTS HAS EMERGED AS AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE OVERALL NOISE SIGNATURE OF SUBSONIC COMMERCIAL TRANSPORTS DURING THEIR LANDING APPROACH.  THE MAJOR SOURCES OF AIRFRAME NOISE INCLUDE HIGH-LIFT DEVICES (I.E., LEADING-EDGE SLAT AND TRAILING-EDGE FLAPS) AND THE AIRCRAFT UNDERCARRIAGE (I.E., LANDING GEAR).  NASA HAS AN ACTIVE PROGRAM OF RESEARCH RELATED TO EACH OF THESE NOISE SOURCES.  IN THE CONTEXT OF SLAT NOISE, NASA S LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER IS ENGAGED IN A COORDINATED SERIES OF INVESTIGATIONS THAT COMBINE HIGH-FIDELITY NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS AND DETAILED WIND TUNNEL MEASUREMENTS OF A GENERIC, UNSWEPT, 3-ELEMENT, HIGH-LIFT CONFIGURATION (GFI ITEMS 5.1-5.5).  THE GOAL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS IS TO PROVIDE A VALIDATED PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY THAT WOULD ENABLE THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE DOMINANT NOISE SOURCE MECHANISMS AND, ULTIMATELY, HELP DEVELOP PHYSICS INSPIRED CONCEPTS FOR REDUCING THE FAR-FIELD ACOUSTIC INTENSITY.  THE EXPERIMENTAL COMPONENT OF THIS RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON A GENERIC, UNSWEPT, 3-ELEMENT, HIGH-LIFT CONFIGURATION.  THE 30P30N CONFIGURATION, DESIGNED BY MCDONNELL-DOUGLAS (NOW BOEING), HAS BEEN USED FOR VARIOUS MEASUREMENTS OF THE UNSTEADY FLOW NEAR THE SLAT IN NASAS BASIC AERODYNAMIC RESEARCH TUNNEL (BART).  PRIMARY DATA OBTAINED THUS FAR INCLUDES PARTICLE IMAGE VELOCIMETRY (PIV) MEASUREMENTS OF THE UNSTEADY FLOW FIELD WITHIN THE SLAT COVE AND IN THE VICINITY OF THE SLAT TRAILING EDGE.  BOTH PLANAR AND STEREO PIV MEASUREMENTS HAVE BEEN OBTAINED TO CHARACTERIZE THE PLANAR AND CROSS-PLANE STRUCTURES WITHIN THIS FLOW.  THIS DATA HAS BEEN VALUABLE FOR VALIDATING THE NEAR-FIELD SIMULATIONS OF UNSTEADY FLOW NEAR THE SLAT REGION AND HAS BEEN USED BY RESEARCHERS AT NASA AS WELL AS ELSEWHERE.  TO ALLOW UNSTEADY PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS ON THE SURFACE OF THE SLAT, NASA FABRICATED A NEW SLAT MODEL INSTRUMENTED WITH DYNAMIC PRESSURE TRANSDUCERS.  BECAUSE OF ACOUSTIC REFLECTIONS WITHIN A CLOSED WALL WIND TUNNEL, IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THE GOAL OF BENCHMARK QUALITY ACOUSTIC MEASUREMENTS WILL ONLY BE MET WITHIN AN OPEN JET FACILITY.  BECAUSE THE AERODYNAMIC LOADING IN SUCH A FACILITY MAY BE RATHER DIFFERENT FROM THAT IN FLIGHT, THERE ARE OPEN QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE UTILITY OF THE AEROACOUSTIC MEASUREMENTS IN AN OPEN JET FACILITY.  TO HELP ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS, TASK ORDER NNL11AD26T (BOEING CONTRACT NNL10AA05B) WAS INITIATED TO PERFORM BOTH AERODYNAMIC AND ACOUSTIC MEASUREMENTS ON THE 30P30N MODEL AT SMALL ANGLES OF ATTACK THAT ARE RELEVANT TO AIRCRAFT APPROACH FOR LANDING.   THIS TASK ORDER BUILDS UPON NNL11AD26T AND IS INTENDED TO OBTAIN SEVERAL EXTRA MEASUREMENTS OF THE 30P30N SLAT (IN THE SAME FACILITY) THAT ARE STILL REQUIRED TO ENABLE THE GOAL OF VALIDATED PHYSICS BASED PREDICTIONS OF SLAT NOISE.

EXTEND THE \GLASS COCKPIT\"" CONCEPT TO AS MANY SOFTWARE-ENABLED CONTROLS, INTERACTIONS, AND COCKPIT DEVICES AS POSSIBLE, AND BY TRANSITIONING TO A CLOUD-CONTROLLED DIGITAL COCKPIT (I.E., WHERE POSSIBLE, COCKPIT SOFTWARE ACTUALLY RUNS REMOTE TO THE AIRCRAFT). SUCH COCKPITS WILL BE MUCH MORE RECONFIGURABLE AND EXTENSIBLE FOR FUTURE AIRCRAFT DESIGNS AND UPGRADES. 3. IDENTIFY THOSE SOFTWARE FUNCTIONS, TO BE MOVED TO CLOUD/NETWORKED ARCHITECTURE THEREBY REDUCING DUPLICATION, ENABLING FASTER UPGRADES, AND SERVING MULTIPLE VEHICLES THROUGH THE CLOUD, WHICH PROVIDES BENEFITS BY INCREASING EFFICIENCY AND REDUCING PER VEHICLE AND PER FLEET COSTS. 4.

(Reference: NASA AMRD NRA NNH06ZEA001N Amendment 4, Appendix A.2, Topic A.2.4 Hybrid Wing/Body Technologies). The new technologies for this effort are directed primarily towards meeting the reduced noise goal. While the SAX-40 based geometry being proposed offers substantially improved fuel burn, the fuel burn goal is somewhat secondary in that the focus of the changes to the geometry are to meet the noise goal. Thus, the plan is to determine the fuel burn advantages of the configuration including impacts of potential changes to reduce noise. Since LTO NOx emissions are from the engine, emissions technology development needs to be done as an engine discipline. Therefore, this effort is to enable development of prediction methods with wind tunnel test validations using a fuel-efficient hybrid wing body configuration based on the non-proprietary CMI SAX-40 geometry. The NASA long-term goal is to develop high-fidelity physics-based prediction methods. Most of the very low flyover noise potential of the hybrid wing body derives from noise shielding for which validated fundamental prediction methods are still in an early state of development. Thus, a non-proprietary 3D definition representative of a flyable efficient transport suitable for wind tunnel testing needs to be created in Phase 1. A major portion of the following Phase 2 proposed effort is to design and build a wind tunnel model with test configuration requirements guided by development of the predictive methods. Advancing prediction methodologies for noise shielding will initially start with empiricism to identify the needs. As investigations continue into years 2 and 3, increasing fidelity refinements will be incorporated. The wind tunnel model will be designed and wind tunnel tested for low-speed aerodynamic and noise data in Phase 2 (year 2 and year 3 respectively)."

CURRENTLY, THE MOST THOROUGH APPROACH IS TO EVALUATE VAST LIBRARIES OF SEQUENCES USING NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING. BY ASSIGNING A RELATIVE ACTIVITY (FITNESS) TO EACH SEQUENCE, IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONSTRUCT EMPIRICAL FITNESS LANDSCAPES. THESE LANDSCAPES CAN BE IMAGINED IN THREE DIMENSIONS, WITH THE X-Y-PLANE REPRESENTING NUCLEOTIDE CHANGES (GENOTYPE SPACE), AND THE Z-AXIS REPRESENTING RNA FITNESS.

WE WILL USE SNOWEX􀁁S GROUND-BASED TERRESTRIAL LIDAR (TLS) AND AIRBORNE LIDAR FROM THE AIRBORNE SNOW OBSERVATORY (ASO) ALONG WITH SNOWEX SNOW PIT, SNOW TRANSECT, AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS, TO QUANTIFY THE IN- AND SUB-CANOPY SNOW DISTRIBUTION FROM FINE (INDIVIDUAL BRANCHES AND TREES) TO COARSE (LANDSCAPE) SCALES. OUR PROJECT IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF SNOWEX BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS A CRUCIAL COMPONENT OF GROUND-TRUTH FOR THE SNOWEX AERIAL CAMPAIGN SNOW-ON AND OFF OBSERVATIONS.

Q2. HOW DO IN- AND SUB-CANOPY SNOW DEPTH DISTRIBUTIONS CHANGE WITH CANOPY CHARACTERISTICS AND FORCING MECHANISMS (E.G. FROM WINDDOMINATED TO INTERCEPTION- AND LONGWAVE ABLATION-DOMINATED) AND HOW DO THESE RELATIONSHIPS/DISTRIBUTIONS CHANGE WITH SPATIAL SCALE? Q3. WHAT PARAMETERIZATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO IMPROVE HOW SNOW MODELS REPRESENT IN- AND SUB-CANOPY SNOW DISTRIBUTIONS ACROSS HETEROGENEOUS CANOPY CONDITIONS AND FORCING MECHANISMS?

THE OVERARCHING QUESTIONS WE SEEK TO ANSWER IN THIS STUDY ARE: 1) WHAT ARE THE BEST DATA FUSION APPROACHES TO QUANTIFY ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE AND WHAT ARE THE ERRORS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE APPROACHES ACROSS MULTIPLE SCALES? 2) TO WHAT EXTENT DO LIDAR AND HYPERSPECTRAL SENSORS REVEAL THE SAME PLANT STRUCTURE INFORMATION AND TO WHAT EXTENT ARE THEY COMPLEMENTARY? 3) WHAT ARE THE COMPOSITIONAL AND SPATIAL CHANGES IN VEGETATION STRUCTURE WITH DISTURBANCE REGIMES OF CLIMATE, FIRE AND INVASIVE SPECIES?   WE WILL DEVELOP REGIONALLY SCALED LIDAR / HYPERSPECTRAL VEGETATION PRODUCTS IN ANTICIPATION OF A NEED TO DETERMINE HOW BEST TO ASSIMILATE THE GROWING NUMBER OF THESE SITE-LEVEL COLLECTIONS (G-LIHT (GSFC), CARNEGIE AIRBORNE OBSERVATORY, NEON AOP), WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY BE LINKED TO SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS. THIS FOUNDATIONAL WORK WILL PROVIDE A BASIS FOR EVALUATING THE EXTENT TO WHICH NEW AND FUTURE SATELLITE MISSIONS ARE SUITABLE FOR CHARACTERIZING DRYLAND VEGETATION STRUCTURE (I.E., LDCM, NPP-VIIRS, HYSPIRI, LIST, ICESAT-2). IMPORTANTLY, THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ECOSYSTEM COMPOSITION AND FUNCTION ON RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND 3D VEGETATION STRUCTURE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY SCIENCE STUDY GROUPS (E.G., HYSPIRI MISSION) AND SCIENTIFIC PANELS (E.G., NRC DECADAL SURVEY) AS HIGH SCIENCE PRIORITIES."

DIFFICULTIES OF ESTIMATING WATER VOLUMES STORED IN SNOW ARE WELL DOCUMENTED. IN SITU MEASUREMENT OVER LARGE AREAS IS CHALLENGING BECAUSE STANDARD TECHNIQUES ARE TIME CONSUMING, WHILE CORRELATION LENGTHS OF SNOW PROPERTIES ARE ON THE ORDER OF 100 M. LONG-TERM SNOW MONITORING NETWORKS REQUIRE A LONG HISTORICAL RECORD TO BE MEANINGFUL FOR STREAMFLOW PREDICTION, AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO AVERAGE REGIONAL SNOW CONDITIONS CAN BE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN, ESPECIALLY IN A CHANGING CLIMATE. REMOTE SENSING IS AN ATTRACTIVE COMPLEMENT TO IN SITU MEASUREMENTS THAT HAS RECEIVED CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION AT A VARIETY OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FREQUENCIES (E.G., MICROWAVE, VISIBLE/INFRARED, LIDAR) AND SPATIOTEMPORAL SCALES. AT VERY LARGE SCALES, MOREOVER, GRAVIMETRIC TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN APPLIED. EACH TECHNIQUE FOR REMOTE SENSING OF SNOW IS ASSOCIATED WITH WEAKNESSES THAT LIMIT THEIR APPLICABILITY ACROSS ALL GEOGRAPHIC SETTINGS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO FURTHER ADVANCE FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE EVOLUTION OF SEASONAL SNOWPACKS IMPACTS REMOTE SENSING OF SNOW AT DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS. IN THIS PROJECT WE FOCUS ON RETRIEVAL OF SWE AT HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTIONS USING MULTIPLE-FREQUENCY MICROWAVE RADAR, LEVERAGING FREQUENCIES ALREADY USED FOR WATER CYCLE REMOTE SENSING. IN PARTICULAR, WE WILL SIMULTANEOUSLY USE INFORMATION FROM HIGHER FREQUENCIES IDEAL FOR DRY SNOW INFORMATION, LOWER FREQUENCIES THAT RESPOND TO SOIL MOISTURE, AND INTERMEDIATE FREQUENCIES THAT ARE SENSITIVE TO BOTH SWE AND SOIL MOISTURE. THIS APPROACH ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM OF WATER STORAGE IN BOTH SNOW AND SOIL AS A JOINT RETRIEVAL PROBLEM. THE OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS OF THIS RESEARCH IS THAT, WHEN USED IN A DATA ASSIMILATION (DA) FRAMEWORK, ACTIVE MICROWAVE OBSERVATION OF SOIL MOISTURE CAN IMPROVE SWE RETRIEVAL (AND VICE VERSA). WE WILL LEVERAGE EXPERTISE IN LAND SURFACE MODELING AND DATA ASSIMILATION, ACTIVE MICROWAVE REMOTE SENSING, FIELD DATA COLLECTION, AND GEOPHYSICAL INVERSE THEORY. WE WILL COLLECT UNIQUE AND HIGHLY TEMPORALLY RESOLVED, ULTRA BROADBAND FREQUENCY MODULATED CONTINUOUS WAVE (FMCW) RADAR DATA AT TWO INTENSIVELY STUDIED FIELD SITES WITH DIFFERENT SNOW COVER CHARACTERISTICS. TOGETHER WITH COINCIDENT FIELD MEASUREMENTS AT THE STUDY AREAS, WE WILL USE FMCW DATASETS TO ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE EVOLUTION OF SNOWPACK AND LAND SURFACE PROPERTIES IMPACTS MICROWAVE OBSERVATION ACROSS A RANGE OF FREQUENCIES THAT SPAN FREQUENCIES COMMONLY USED FOR EARTH REMOTE SENSING. WE WILL USE THESE DATASETS CONJUNCTIVELY TO BETTER PARAMETERIZE BOTH FORWARD GEOPHYSICAL MODELS OF MICROWAVE SCATTERING AND RETRIEVALS OF LAND SURFACE PROPERTIES FROM MICROWAVE OBSERVATIONS. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO USE LAND SURFACE MODELS TO SYNTHESIZE REALISTIC RADAR OBSERVATIONS AT L-, X-, AND KU-BANDS OVER LARGE REGIONS AND AT DIFFERENT SPATIAL RESOLUTIONS. WE WILL CONFIRM SYNTHESIZED OBSERVATIONS AGAINST EXISTING SATELLITE (E.G., TERRASAR-X) AND AIRBORNE (E.G., POLSCAT) DATA DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD NASA COLD LAND PROCESSES EXPERIMENTS (CLPX-II AND -III). THE ABILITY TO SYNTHESIZE REALISTIC ACTIVE MICROWAVE OBSERVATIONS WILL FACILITATE OBSERVING SYSTEM SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS (OSSES) TO INVESTIGATE IMPROVEMENTS IN SNOW STORAGE ESTIMATION THROUGH ASSIMILATING MULTIPLE-CHANNEL MICROWAVE OBSERVATIONS INTO MODELS. THESE OSSES ALLOW THE INVESTIGATOR TEAM TO DESIGN HYPOTHETICAL MISSIONS TO COMPLEMENT EXISTING SATELLITES TO ENHANCE  RETRIEVAL OF SNOW INFORMATION AND QUANTIFY TRADE SPACES RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF MICROWAVE FREQUENCY OF OBSERVATIONS ASSIMILATED, TEMPORAL REVISIT, SPATIAL RESOLUTION, AND OBSERVATIONAL ERROR."

A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IN STELLAR ASTROPHYSICS IS HOW STARS SHED THE BULK OF THEIR MASS AS THEY DIE. MUCH OF THIS MASS IS EJECTED DURING THE LPV PHASE OF STELLAR EVOLUTION. THAT MATERIAL, ENRICHED BY THE NUCLEOSYNTHETIC PRODUCTS CREATED DEEP IN A STARS INTERIOR, IS RECYCLED INTO THE INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM TO FORM THE NEXT GENERATIONS OF STARS AND PLANETS AND, OVER TIME, CHANGES THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE GALAXY. THE AMPLITUDE AND PERIOD DISTRIBUTION OF LPVS, AND HOW LONG THEY REMAIN IN THIS STAGE, PROFOUNDLY IMPACT THE TYPE AND AMOUNT OF ENRICHED MATERIAL THAT IS RETURNED TO THE ISM. HOWEVER, A PROFOUND IMPEDIMENT TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS IMPORTANT PHASE OF STELLAR EVOLUTION IS THE LACK OF AN UNBIASED SAMPLE FOR THE DISK OF THE MILKY WAY. RECENT VARIABILITY SURVEYS OF THE MAGELLANIC CLOUDS AND THE GALACTIC BULGE HAVE ACCURATELY COUNTED LPVS IN THOSE ENVIRONMENTS AS A FUNCTION OF LUMINOSITY, PULSATION MODE, AND PERIOD BUT NO SUITABLE COMPARISON EXISTS FOR THE GALACTIC DISK. CURRENT COUNTS OF GALACTIC LPVS ARE FROM HETEROGENEOUS COMPILATIONS OF COUNTLESS OBSERVING PROGRAMS, EACH WITH ITS OWN BIASES. CONSEQUENTLY, THE IMPACT OF THESE POPULATIONS OF EVOLVED STARS ON THEIR HOST GALAXIES AT SOLAR METALLICITIES REMAINS UNKNOWN.  OUR PROJECT WILL USE THE FFIS FROM THE KEPLER ARCHIVE TO ADDRESS THIS NEED BY CREATING THE FIRST UNBIASED CATALOG OF DISK LPVS AND ANALYZING THEIR PROPERTIES. THESE IMAGES OF THE ENTIRE 116 SQUARE DEGREE FIELD, TAKEN AT A CADENCE OF ABOUT ONCE EVERY 30 DAYS, MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE FIRST TIME TO CREATE AN UNBIASED DATABASE OF PULSATING, DYING STARS ON THE ASYMPTOTIC GIANT BRANCH IN THE DISK. WE WILL CREATE AN ATLAS OF 1500 DAY LIGHT CURVES TO CHARACTERIZE THEIR VARIABILITY AND MASS-LOSS PROPERTIES AND TO ENABLE THEIR COMPARISON TO POPULATIONS OF EVOLVED STARS IN THE GALACTIC BULGE AND MAGELLANIC CLOUDS. WE WILL EXTRACT THE POINT SOURCES FROM EACH FULL FIELD AND CROSS CORRELATE THE SOURCES ACROSS THE MONTHLY EPOCHS TO CREATE LIGHT CURVES AND CALIBRATE THE STELLAR FLUXES; AND SELECT CANDIDATE VARIABLES. FOR THE CANDIDATE VARIABLES, WE WILL QUANTIFY THE PULSATION STRENGTHS AND PERIODS AND CROSS CORRELATE WITH INFRARED DATA FROM 2MASS, WISE, AND SPITZER TO CHARACTERIZE THEIR DUST; DETERMINE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES INCLUDING MASS LOSS RATES, LUMINOSITIES, AND DISTANCES; AND INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE LPV POPULATION ON THE MILKY WAY.

FOLLOWING ON FROM SEAWIFS AND MODIS MISSIONS, THE  PRE-AEROSOL, CLOUD, OCEAN ECOSYSTEM (PACE) MISSION IS DESIGNED TO FULFILL THE CLIMATE CONTINUITY REQUIREMENTS, WITH A LAUNCH READINESS IN THE TIME FRAME OF 7 YEARS. BEYOND THE ESTIMATION OF PHYTOPLANKTON CHLOROPHYLL CONCENTRATION, THE GOALS OF PACE ARE TO PROVIDE \CLIMATE-QUALITY GLOBAL OCEAN COLOR MEASUREMENTS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING THE CARBON CYCLE AND GLOBAL OCEAN ECOLOGY AND DETERMINING HOW THE OCEAN''S ROLE IN GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL (CARBON) CYCLING AND OCEAN ECOLOGY BOTH AFFECTS AND IS AFFECTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE.\"" AMONG THE IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE OCEAN COLOR SPECIFICATIONS ARE INCREASED SPECTRAL AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION. ONE OF THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES OF THE PACE MISSION IS THE RETRIEVAL OF THE INHERENT OPTICAL PROPERTIES (IOPS), ABSORPTION AND BACKSCATTERING, VIA OCEAN COLOR INVERSION ALGORITHMS. THE  CAPABILITY FOR RETRIEVING SPECTRAL PHYTOPLANKTON ABSORPTION COEFFICIENTS IS KEY TO ADDRESSING QUESTIONS OF CARBON CYCLING AND OCEAN ECOLOGY AS THESE COEFFICIENTS PROVIDE NOT ONLY AN ESTIMATE OF ALGAL CONCENTRATION (THAT CAN BE LINKED BY PROXY TO ALGAL CARBON) BUT ALSO TO ALGAL COMPOSITION VIA  PIGMENT-BASED TAXONOMIC DISCRIMINATION. PIGMENT-BASED TAXONOMIC COMPOSITION PROVIDES A KEY APPROACH TO DEFINING PHYTOPLANKTON FUNCTIONAL TYPES (PFTS) AS MANY OF THE PIGMENT-BASED LINEAGES COINCIDE WITH BIOGEOCHEMICAL NICHES, CALCIFIERS, SILICIFIERS, NITROGEN FIXERS, ETC. ONE CHALLENGE FOR THE PACE MISSION IS TO DEFINE ROBUST PROTOCOLS WITH QUANTIFIED UNCERTAINTY TERMS FOR CONSTRUCTING VALIDATION DATA SETS FOR PHYTOPLANKTON ABSORPTION. WHILE IN SITU OPTICAL TECHNOLOGIES EXIST TO  MEASURE HYPERSPECTRAL ABSORPTION ON THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES APPROACHING THOSE REQUIRED FOR SATELLITE VALIDATION, EXTRACTING THE SIGNATURE ASSOCIATED SOLELY WITH PHYTOPLANKTON CANNOT CURRENTLY BE PERFORMED ANALYTICALLY AND THUS WE RELY ON MODEL ESTIMATES. MEASURING PHYTOPLANKTON ABSORPTION REQUIRES COLLECTION OF DISCRETE WATER SAMPLES, COLLECTING THE PARTICLES ON GLASS FIBER FILTERS TO REMOVE THE OPTICAL CONTRIBUTION BY COLORED DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER (CDOM), AND MEASURING THE ABSORPTION SPECTROPHOTOMETRICALLY BEFORE AND AFTER PIGMENT  EXTRACTION. THE ABSORPTION BY THE PHYTOPLANKTON PIGMENTS IN VIVO IS CALCULATED BY DIFFERENCE. HOWEVER, THE FILTER PAD CONTAMINATES THE SIGNAL DUE TO ITS STRONG SCATTERING PROPERTIES AND ADDITIONALLY AMPLIFIES THE OPTICAL PATHLENGTH OF TRANSMITTED PHOTONS IN THE SPECTROPHOTOMETER. THESE TWO ERROR SOURCES ARE INADVERTENTLY COMBINED INTO A SINGLE CORRECTION FACTOR, BETA, CALLED THE PATHLENGTH  AMPLIFICATION FACTOR. MANY RESEARCHERS OVER THE YEARS HAVE INVESTIGATED THIS FACTOR USING A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES AND TECHNOLOGIES AND YET IT REMAINS THE LARGEST SOURCE OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE QUANTIFICATION OF PHYTOPLANKTON ABSORPTION. UNFORTUNATELY, MODELS FOR EXTRACTING THE PHYTOPLANKTON ABSORPTION FROM IN SITU OBSERVATIONS OF WHOLE WATER OR PARTICULATE ABSORPTION ARE BASED UPON LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS IN WHICH BETA WAS POORLY CONSTRAINED AT WORST, OR AT BEST FOR WHICH THE UNCERTAINTIES WERE NOT QUANTIFIED. THUS IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE NEED FOR OCEAN COLOR VALIDATION OF PHYTOPLANKTON ABSORPTION COEFFICIENTS, A UNIFIED APPROACH LINKING THE QUANTITATIVE FILTER PAD  TECHNIQUE TO CONTINUOUS IN SITU ABSORPTION OBSERVATIONS IS REQUIRED AND IS THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THIS PROPOSAL. THE SECONDARY FOCUS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER MULTISPECTRAL CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE CAN PROVIDE A QUANTITATIVE PROXY FOR PHYTOPLANKTON ABSORPTION AT THE  EXCITATION WAVELENGTHS. THIS APPROACH WOULD EXPAND THE OPPORTUN"""

OVER THE PAST 3 YEARS, WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT LOW-DOSE 56FE (IRON) RADIATION HAS LONG-TERM, SEX-SPECIFIC CONSEQUENCES ON COGNITION, LOCOMOTION, NEUROINFLAMMATION AND ALZHEIMER􀁊S DISEASE (AD) PATHOGENESIS, WITH MALES BEING MORE VULNERABLE THAN FEMALES. ANALYSIS OF PROTON-IRRADIATED MICE IS UNDERWAY. OVER THE PAST YEAR, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A COLLABORATION WITH DR. DORIS TAYLOR (TEXAS HEART INSTITUTE), CO-I ON THIS PROPOSAL, BY SHARING THE HEART, ONE KIDNEY AND BONE MARROW FROM EACH OF THE MICE IRRADIATED IN THREE OF OUR STUDIES. OVER THE NEXT 4 YEARS, WE WILL EXTEND OUR RESEARCH BY COMPARING OUR EXISTING DATA FROM OUR CURRENT STUDIES ON THE LATE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) AND CARDIOVASCULAR (CV) EFFECTS OF A SINGLE DOSE OF IRON RADIATION OR A SINGLE DOSE OF PROTONS WITH A SINGLE DOSE OF OXYGEN-16 OR MIXED BEAM GCR (PROTONS, OXYGEN-16 AND IRON) IN MALE AND FEMALE AD-LIKE TRANSGENIC AND WILDTYPE MICE, AND GAMMA IRRADIATED WILDTYPE MICE (AIM 1).

WE WILL PERFORM LONGITUDINAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) ON THE BRAIN AND HEART IN A SUBSET OF MICE IN AIMS 1 AND 2 TO DETERMINE RADIATION-INDUCED CHANGES WITHIN INDIVIDUAL ANIMALS. IN ADDITION, MICE WILL UNDERGO EXTENSIVE BEHAVIORAL TESTING AS WELL AS PATHOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF BRAIN AND HEART.

THIS IS OF CONCERN GIVEN THAT CHRONIC SLEEP LOSS IS HIGHLY PREVALENT DURING SPACE MISSIONS, WHICH ALSO OFTEN REQUIRE MAINTENANCE OF UNUSUAL SLEEP-WAKE AND WORK SCHEDULES THAT THE CIRCADIAN SYSTEM DOES NOT READILY ADAPT TO, FURTHER INCREASING SLEEPINESS AND REDUCING SLEEP. IN SUCH A HIGH-RISK ENVIRONMENT, THE RISK OF SLEEPINESS-RELATED PERFORMANCE IMPAIRMENT MUST BE MINIMIZED. IT IS ALSO INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED THAT THE RESPONSE TO SLEEP LOSS AND CIRCADIAN DESYNCHRONY IS HIGHLY INDIVIDUALIZED AND BOTH CHALLENGE- AND TASK-DEPENDENT. THIS HIGH DEGREE OF INTER-INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHO WILL BE AT RISK AND WHEN THEY WILL BE AT RISK, AND THEREFORE A `ONE-SIZEFITS-ALL  APPROACH IS LIKELY TO BE SUBOPTIMAL. WHAT IS NEEDED ARE BIOMARKERS OF INDIVIDUAL VULNERABILITIES AND RESILIENCIES TO SLEEP LOSS AND CIRCADIAN DESYNCHRONIZATION THAT CAN BE USED TO PREDICT PROBLEMS AND INTERVENE WHEN NECESSARY. TO DATE, THERE ARE NO BIOMARKERS THAT ARE APPROVED TO DETERMINE INDIVIDUAL ASTRONAUTS  VULNERABILITIES TO SLEEP LOSS AND CIRCADIAN RHYTHM DISRUPTION, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY CANDIDATES TO TEST. IN A RECENT NASA EVIDENCE REVIEW ADDRESSING HRP SLEEP GAP4, WE IDENTIFIED AND EVALUATED APPROXIMATELY 80 POTENTIAL BIOMARKERS OF RESPONSE TO SLEEP LOSS OR CIRCADIAN DESYNCHRONY, RANGING FROM SIMPLE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENTS OF ALERTNESS THROUGH TO GENETIC POLYMORPHISMS. WHILE THERE ARE FEW DATA SPECIFICALLY CHARACTERIZING INDIVIDUAL RESPONSES TO SLEEP LOSS AND CIRCADIAN DESYNCHRONY, FORTUNATELY, MANY OF THESE BIOMARKERS HAVE BEEN STUDIED BY OUR RESEARCH GROUP IN DETAILED LABORATORY CONDITIONS OF THOUSANDS OF SUBJECTS OVER TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BED-DAYS IN FEDERALLY-FUNDED STUDIES, BUT HAVE NEVER BEEN EXAMINED WITH RESPECT TO INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES. FURTHERMORE, IN A PREVIOUS NASA-SUPPORTED STUDY (ROSES-2008), WE STUDIED 51 ANTARCTIC EXPEDITIONERS OVER 6 MONTHS DURING THE ANTARCTIC WINTER (MARCH TO SEPTEMBER) AT AUSTRALIAN ANTARCTIC STATIONS CASEY, DAVIS AND MAWSON (54% OF THE OVERWINTERING POPULATION). A LARGE NUMBER OF SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF STRESS, AFFECT, SAFETY, TEAM INTERACTIONS AND WELL-BEING WERE RECORDED, IN ADDITION TO SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTCOMES INCLUDING SLEEP, CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS, URINARY CORTISOL AND MELATONIN LEVELS, A RANGE OF NEUROCOGNITIVE PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES AND ALERTNESS. THE LARGE DATASET IS AVAILABLE TO TEST THE PREDICTIVE VALUE OF A RANGE OF BEHAVIORAL, PERFORMANCE, SLEEP AND CIRCADIAN BIOMARKERS ON NEUROCOGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND GOING FORWARD, WILL ALLOW OUR RESEARCH TEAM, IN COLLABORATION WITH HRP, TO SELECT ONLY THOSE MEASURES THAT YIELD SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION FOR FUTURE STUDY, AND WILL ALLOW CAPACITY TO ADD NEW MEASURES NOT YET ASSESSED UNDER THESE OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS. BASED ON THIS REVIEW, WE HAVE DEVISED A PROTOCOL TO ASSESS THE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF A CORE SET OF THESE BIOMARKERS TO PREDICT NEUROCOGNITIVE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO THE SLEEP DEPRIVATION AND CIRCADIAN MISALIGNMENT INHERENT IN ISS OPERATIONS. FIRST, WE WILL IDENTIFY CANDIDATE BIOMARKERS FROM OUR LABORATORY ANALOG, WHERE INDIVIDUALS ARE HOUSED IN INDIVIDUAL, SEMI-ISOLATED, WINDOW-LESS SUITES, AND FROM EXISTING EXTENSIVE LONGITUDINAL DATA IN OVER 50 ANTARCTIC EXPEDITIONERS. THESE, AND PREVIOUSLY UNTESTED BIOMARKERS, WILL THEN BE VALIDATED IN NEW LIMITED LABORATORY ANALOG STUDIES TO INFORM A NEW ANALOG STUDY THAT WILL TEST THE FEASIBILITY AND UTILITY OF A SET OF CORE BIOMARKERS TO PREDICT AND ASSESS VARIATION IN NEUROCOGNITIVE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION ASSOCIATED WITH LIVING IN ANTARCTICA DURING A 12-MONTH MISSION.

RECENTLY, WE AND OTHERS HAVE SHOWN THAT SHORT-WAVELENGTH (BLUE) LIGHT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAVELENGTH FOR ENHANCING ALERTNESS AND PERFORMANCE DIRECTLY, AND FOR PHASE-SHIFTING THE CIRCADIAN PACEMAKER. LIGHT THEREFORE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE A SAFE, NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL COUNTERMEASURE TO REDUCE THE RISK OF PERFORMANCE DEFICITS AND CIRCADIAN MISALIGNMENT DURING SPACE FLIGHT. USING BLUE LIGHT ALONE, HOWEVER, IS UNDESIRABLE AS IT IMPAIRS VISUAL FUNCTION BUT MANIPULATION OF THE BLUE LIGHT CONTENT OF WHITE LIGHT HAS SIMILAR BENEFITS, AND CAN OPTIMIZE VISUAL AND NON-VISUAL LIGHT RESPONSES SIMULTANEOUSLY. NASA IS REPLACING THE CURRENT LIGHTING ABOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION WITH A NEW SOLID STATE LIGHTING ASSEMBLY (SSLA), INCORPORATING THREE PRE-DETERMINED SETTINGS TO ADDRESS DIFFERENT OPERATIONAL NEEDS: 1) WHITE LIGHT FOR GENERAL VISION; 2) BLUE-ENRICHED HIGH INTENSITY WHITE LIGHT TO ENHANCE ALERTNESS AND CIRCADIAN ADAPTATION; 3) BLUE-DEPLETED LOW INTENSITY WHITE LIGHT TO MINIMIZE ALERTNESS PRIOR TO SLEEP. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A DYNAMIC LIGHTING SCHEDULE (DLS) WHICH DETERMINES WHEN EACH OF THESE THREE SETTINGS WILL BE USED TO OPTIMIZE LIGHTING TO IMPROVE ALERTNESS AND PERFORMANCE, RESET CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS AND ENHANCE SLEEP, WHILE MAINTAINING VISION. LABORATORY-BASED ANALOG STUDIES OF THE DLS ARE ONGOING.

BEGINNING WITHTHE FIRST DATA IN 1978 AND WITH CONTINUOUS DATA SINCE THE EARLY 1990S, SCATTEROMETER DATA COMPRISES THE LONGEST SCIENTIFIC DATA RECORD OF MICROWAVE RADAR BACKSCATTER MEASUREMENTS OF THE EARTH. THE SCATTEROMETER DATA SET PROVIDES AN UNPARALLELED RECORD FOR THE STUDY OF GLOBAL CLIMATE SYSTEMS. BOTH OCEAN WIND AND LAND/ICE APPLICATIONS OF SCATTEROMETER DATA BENEFIT FROM THE USE OF PROVEN RECONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES TO ENHANCE THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF THE BACKSCATTER MEASUREMENTS. SUCH ENHANCED RESOLUTION MEASUREMENTS ENABLE PRODUCTION ULTRA-HIGH RESOLUTION (UHR) 2.5-4.5 KM/PIXEL WIND PRODUCTS AND IMPROVE THE UTILITY OF SCATTEROMETER MEASUREMENTS IN LAND/ICE APPLICATIONS. UHR WINDS HAVE PROVEN VALUABLE IN OPERATIONAL SEVERE WEATHER FORECASTING, NEAR-COASTAL STUDIES, AND MESOSCALE WIND AND RAIN STUDIES. FURTHERMORE, RESOLUTION ENHANCEMENT CAN PROVIDE KEY INFORMATION ON MESOSCALE PROCESSES AFFECTING BOTH UHR AND CONVENTIONALRESOLUTION SCATTEROMETER WIND RETRIEVAL. RAIN IS A WELL-KNOWN LIMITATION OF SCATTEROMETER WIND RETRIEVAL. SIMULTANEOUS WIND/RAIN (SWR) RETRIEVAL AT UHR IMPROVES BOTH THE WIND AND RAIN RETRIEVAL SINCE THE SIZE OF RAIN CELLS ARE ON THE ORDER OF THE UHR WIND VECTOR CELLS. UHR RETRIEVAL MINIMIZES BEAMFILLING AND COREGISTRATION PROBLEMS BETWEEN THE WIND AND THE RAIN, AND THUS CAN RESULT IN MORE ACCURATE WIND ESTIMATES AS WELL AS MEASUREMENTS OF THE RAIN RATE. CONVENTIONAL-RESOLUTION SWR RETRIEVAL HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED AT BOTH KU- AND C-BAND. UHR SWR RETRIEVAL HAS BEEN VALIDATED AT KU-BAND, BUT FURTHER VALIDATION AT C-BAND IS NEEDED. CONVENTIONAL-RESOLUTION RAIN FLAGS CAN BENEFIT FROM INFORMATION DERIVED FROM UHR SWR RETRIEVAL. FOR EXAMPLE, THRESHOLDING UHR SWR RAIN ESTIMATES CAN IDENTIFY INDIVIDUAL SIGMA-0 MEASUREMENTS ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY RAIN. THESE MEASUREMENTS CAN BE EXCLUDED DURING WIND RETRIEVAL TO MINIMIZE ADVERSE RAIN IMPACT. NONTRADITIONAL APPLICATIONS OF SCATTEROMETER DATA OVER LAND AND ICE HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY VALIDATED IN VEGETATION CLASSIFICATION, SEA ICE EXTENT MONITORING, SEA ICE MOTION, SNOW AND ICE MELT ONSET/REFREEZE, SNOW COVER EXTENT, AND OPERATIONAL ICEBERG TRACKING. THESE STUDIES HAVE BENEFITED FROM THE COMPREHENSIVE SUITE OF ENHANCED- AND CONVENTIONAL RESOLUTION BACKSCATTER PRODUCTS PRODUCED BY THE PIS SCATTEROMETER CLIMATE RECORD PATHFINDER (SCP). THIS TERRESTRIAL AND POLAR SURFACE SCATTEROMETER CLIMATE RECORD (SCR) INCLUDES DATA FROM SEAWINDS, QUIKSCAT, NSCAT, ERS-1/2, ASCAT1, SASS, AMSR-E, AND SSM/I. THE SCP SCR HAS BEEN WIDELY ADOPTED WITHIN THE CLIMATE COMMUNITY AND OUR PROCESSING ALGORITHMS ARE BEING OPERATIONALLY USED FOR SEA ICE MONITORING AND ICEBERG TRACKING. THIS INVESTIGATION WILL (1) REFINE, APPLY, AND VALIDATE UHR WIND AND SWR RETRIEVAL TECHNIQUES FOR OCEAN DATA, INCLUDING RESEARCHING IMPROVED AMBIGUITY SELECTION AND RAIN FLAGGING WITH EMPHASIS ON IMPROVING THE CONSISTENCY OF THE SCATTEROMETER WIND/RAIN CLIMATE RECORD, AND (2) CONTINUE AND EXTEND THE LAND/ICE SCP SCR FOR EXISTING SENSORS (ASCAT-1/2 AND THE OCEANSAT-2 SCATTEROMETER) AND ADD NEW SENSOR DATA (RAPIDSCAT) AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE.

HOWEVER, OUR PROPOSED WORK WILL SHOW THAT WE CAN HAVE COMPLIANT, UNDERACTUATED SYSTEMS THAT ARE ROBUST WHEN OPERATING IN UNCERTAIN CONDITIONS WHILE STILL HAVING PRECISE, HIGH PERFORMANCE CONTROL FOR MANIPULATION AND MOBILITY. IN ORDER TO DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE CONTROL FOR SOFT ROBOTS, WE WILL USE OPTIMAL CONTROL METHODS SUCH AS MODEL PREDICTIVE CONTROL (MPC). THESE METHODS WILL INITIALLY BE DEVELOPED ON A 14 DEGREE OF FREEDOM, PNEUMATICALLY ACTUATED, FABRIC-BASED, LIGHT-WEIGHT, MECHANICALLY ROBUST ROBOT TORSO AND ARMS DEVELOPED BY OTHERLAB (PNEUBOTICS). THIS PLATFORM WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED FOR THE DARPA MAXIMUM MOBILITY AND MANIPULATION PROGRAM AND WILL ARRIVE AT BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY, INDEPENDENT OF THIS PROPOSAL, BY EARLY 2014. THIS SYSTEM IS UNDERACTUATED AND UNDERDAMPED, AND ADVANCES IN CONTROL FOR THIS PLATFORM SHOULD TRANSLATE WELL TO SYSTEMS WITH SIMILAR DYNAMICS. FURTHERMORE, THE ROBUSTNESS OF THIS PLATFORM TO IMPACT AND UNMODELED COLLISIONS WILL ENABLE US, AS PART OF OUR PROPOSED RESEARCH, TO DEVELOP CONTROLLERS FOR COLLABORATIVELY WORKING WITH OTHER SOFT ROBOTS OR PEOPLE IN HARSH ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS SPACE. THE PLATFORM ON WHICH WE ARE DEVELOPING OUR ALGORITHMS IS LIGHT-WEIGHT, RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE, AND CAN BE COMPACTLY STORED FOR TRANSPORTATION. THE RESULT OF OUR PROPOSED WORK WILL BE A SET OF CONTROL ALGORITHMS THAT WILL IMPROVE THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE AND RELEVANCE OF SOFT ROBOTS FOR FUTURE NASA MISSIONS. THE MAIN FOCUS OF OUR PROPOSAL CAN BE DESCRIBED AS:   DEVELOP OPTIMAL CONTROL METHODS FOR UNDERDAMPED, UNDERACTUATED, SOFT ROBOTS THAT ALLOW FAST AND PRECISE MOTION DESPITE THE DIFFICULT NATURAL DYNAMICS OF THE SYSTEM.   APPLY THESE CONTROL METHODS TO ACHIEVE UNPRECEDENTED PERFORMANCE IN REAL AND UNMODELED ENVIRONMENTS FOR SOFT ROBOT MANIPULATION AND LOCOMOTION.   TEST THE CONTROLLERS WE DEVELOP IN REALISTIC AND USEFUL SCENARIOS (SUCH AS EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE OR INSTALLATION, OR EXPLORATION OF RUGGED TERRAIN), THAT WILL HAVE WIDE APPLICABILITY TO FUTURE SPACE MISSIONS AS WELL AS OTHER CROSSCUTTING DOMAINS SUCH AS NATURAL DISASTER RELIEF OR SEARCH AND RESCUE MISSIONS. INITIAL TESTS FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS WILL FOCUS ON ROBOT MANIPULATION AND WILL INCLUDE 1) GRASPING UNKNOWN OBJECTS USING A LOW-DEGREEOF- FREEDOM COMPLIANT HAND, AND 2) MANIPULATING UNMODELED COMPLIANT MATERIALS. TESTS IN THE THIRD YEAR WILL FOCUS ON APPLYING OUR NEW LOW-LEVEL SOFT ROBOT CONTROLLERS TO 1) PERFORM LOCOMOTION OVER ROUGH TERRAIN WITH A SOFT ROBOT QUADRUPED PLATFORM AND 2) PERFORM TASKS THAT REQUIRE MANIPULATION AND LOCOMOTION SIMULTANEOUSLY. OUR INITIAL APPROACH FOR CONTROL, WHICH IS CALLED MPC, USES AN EXPLICIT MODEL OF THE UNDERDAMPED AND UNDERACTUATED DYNAMICS AND SHOULD ALLOW FOR SMOOTH, CONTROLLED MOTION, WHILE ALSO FACILITATING THE ABILITY TO LEVERAGE THE UNDERDAMPED NATURE OF THE SYSTEM. THESE EXPECTATIONS COME FROM RESULTS OF OUR PRIOR WORK WITH MPC. OUR PROPOSED WORK WILL SIGNIFICANTLY EXTEND RESEARCH WHERE WE HAD DEVELOPED CONTROLLERS FOR RIGID ROBOTS WITH COMPLIANCE AT THE JOINTS AND TACTILE SENSING (SEE HTTP://YOUTU.BE/T8SZ-CO1ORE AND HTTP:// YOUTU.BE/OTPWNZ2GPPG). MPC ALSO ALLOWS THE DEFINITION OF HARD CONSTRAINTS, SUCH AS ACTUATOR OR JOINT LIMITS. THIS MEANS THAT IN ADDITION TO THE NATURAL ROBUSTNESS OF SOFT ROBOTS TO UNMODELED CONTACT, WE CAN ALSO EXPLICITLY DEFINE ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS FOR OUR ROBOT SUCH AS PROXIMITY TO PEOPLE OR MAXIMUM CONTACT FORCE. THE ABILITY TO MOVE QUICKLY WHILE COMPENSATING FOR OSCILLATION AND RESPECTING IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS WILL BE A FOUNDATIONAL CAPABILITY FOR MANIPULATION AND MOBILITY WITH SOFT ROBOTS."

WITH AN ANNOUNCED PHOBOS SAMPLE RETURN  MISSION AND INTEREST IN USING PHOBOS AS A BASE FROM WHICH TO EXPLORE MARS, THE POTENTIAL FOR VIABLE  MICROBES ON PHOBOS WOULD PRESENT COMPELLING ASTROBIOLOGICAL INTEREST BUT ALSO A SIGNIFICANT AND  URGENT PLANETARY PROTECTION CONCERN.  THE TRANSIT OF MICROBES FROM MARS TO PHOBOS WOULD NECESSARILY INVOLVE A HIGH-VELOCITY IMPACT ON THE  PHOBOS SURFACE. NUMEROUS  STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT MICROORGANISMS, PARTICULARLY BACTERIAL  SPORES, SURVIVE UNUSUALLY HIGH SHOCK PRESSURES AND OTHER HARSH CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, THESE  EXPERIMENTS DO NOT CONSTRAIN THE SURVIVABILITY OF INDIVIDUAL MICROBES AS THEY IMPACT A SOLID  SURFACE AT THESE SPEEDS.  WE HAVE DEVELOPED A UNIQUE MICROBE ACCELERATOR THAT IS ABLE TO APPROXIMATE THESE CONDITIONS. WE  PROPOSE A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS TO CHARACTERIZE THE SURVIVABILITY OF SEVERAL TYPES OF MICROBES IN  IMPACTS UP TO 1 KM/S WITH SOLID SURFACES, INCLUDING PHOBOS REGOLITH SIMULANT. ADDITIONAL  EXPERIMENTS WILL CHARACTERIZE THE ELASTICITY OF MICROBES DURING IMPACTS AND THE RESULTING  IMPLICATIONS FOR DISPERSAL.  IN THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENTS, MICROBES ARE CHARGED USING ELECTROSPRAY, INTRODUCED INTO VACUUM, AND  AERODYNAMICALLY ACCELERATED TO THE DESIRED VELOCITY. IMAGE CHARGE DETECTION IS USED TO MEASURE THE  VELOCITY OF EACH IMPACTING MICROBE. AFTER A SUITABLE NUMBER OF MICROBES HAVE IMPACTED UNDER ONE SET OF CONDITIONS, THE CANISTER CONTAINING THE IMPACT TARGET IS  REMOVED FOR ANALYSIS. THIS ACCELERATOR CAN EXPLORE A WIDE RANGE OF ORGANISMS AND IMPACT CONDITIONS.  NOT ONLY DOES THIS APPROACH OVERCOME THE TIME AND COST LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING METHODS FOR SHOCK SURVIVABILITY EXPERIMENTS, BUT DIRECT IMPACT OF A SPORE ON A SURFACE  IS PHYSICALLY A VERY DIFFERENT PHENOMENON THAN SHOCK TRANSMITTED TO A MICROBE THROUGH A SOLID OR  LIQUID MATRIX. THUS, THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENTS ADDRESS A CURRENT, CRITICAL GAP IN OUR ASSESSMENT OF PLANETARY PROTECTION RISK FOR PHOBOS AND FOR UNDERSTANDING THE  LIMITS OF MICROBIAL LIFE GENERALLY."

NECESSARY SYSTEM ELECTRONICS, SENSITIVE SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS AND ESPECIALLY ASTRONAUTS ONBOARD THE SPACECRAFT MUST OPERATE WITHIN A SPECIFIC TEMPERATURE WINDOW OR THE MISSION WILL FAIL. HOWEVER, THE TENDENCY OF A SPACECRAFT''S TEMPERATURE IS TO INCREASE. THE SUN AND THE EARTH RADIATE HEAT THAT IS ABSORBED INTO THE SPACECRAFT WHILE ON BOARD ELECTRONICS AND PERSONNEL GENERATE HEAT INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT. ON EARTH, THIS EXCESS HEAT WOULD NORMALLY BE REMOVED BY AIR AROUND THE SPACECRAFT. HOWEVER, THE SPACECRAFT IS IN THE VACUUM OF SPACE. AS SUCH, THE HEAT MUST ULTIMATELY BE EMITTED AWAY FROM THE SPACECRAFT AS RADIATION. COMPONENTS DESIGNED TO EMIT THIS EXCESS HEAT ARE CALLED RADIATORS AND ARE A VITAL PART OF THE THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OF ANY SPACECRAFT. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE HEAT LOAD ON A SYSTEM VARIES WITH ORBIT, RADIATORS ARE DESIGNED FOR A WORST CASE HEATING SCENARIO. AS SUCH, ANY HEATING CONFIGURATION OUTSIDE OF THE DESIGNED HEATING SCENARIO CAUSES THE RADIATOR TO BEHAVE IN AN UNDESIRABLE WAY, EMITTING MORE HEAT THAN DESIRED OR ABSORBING TOO MUCH HEAT FROM THE SURROUNDINGS. LIKEWISE, THESE RADIATORS ARE HEAVY, OFTEN COMPRISING 30 - 40 PERCENT OF TOTAL SPACECRAFT WEIGHT. A SIMPLE YET EFFECTIVE SOLUTION, AS DISCUSSED IN THE THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ROADMAP, IS TO DEVELOP A LIGHTWEIGHT RADIATOR WHICH IS ABLE TO MANIPULATE ITS HEAT REJECTION RATE IN REAL TIME.  THIS PROPOSAL DISCUSSES A LIGHT WEIGHT, VARIABLE HEAT REJECTION TECHNOLOGY THAT MAY BE UTILIZED IN MANY APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING THAT OF A DEEP SPACE RADIATOR. A THIN, MIRROR FINISH ALUMINUM FOIL IS FOLDED INTO A SIMPLE, ORIGAMI INSPIRED V GROOVE PATTERN. THIS PATTERN ALLOWS FOR THE FOIL TO BE COMPRESSED, SUCH THAT THE V GROOVES ARE VERY STEEP AND TIGHTLY COMPACTED, OR STRETCHED UNTIL IT RESEMBLES A FLAT SHEET.  AS THE FOIL IS COMPRESSED, THE AMOUNT OF HEAT RADIATED INTO SPACE OR THE AMOUNT OF HEAT ABSORBED IS GREATLY INCREASED. WHEN PULLED FLAT, THE FOIL WILL EMIT AND ABSORB VERY LITTLE RADIATION. THIS VARIABLE HEAT REJECTION CAPABILITY IS USEFUL FOR BOTH RADIATOR AND HEAT SHIELD APPLICATIONS. AS A RADIATOR, THE FOIL WILL GIVE THE USER CONTROL OF HOW MUCH HEAT IS ENTERING OR LEAVING THE SYSTEM. THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY RADIATOR WEIGHT WHILE DELIVERING OPTIMUM HEAT REJECTION PERFORMANCE FOR THE ENTIRE MISSION DURATION. LIKEWISE, THESE FOILS MAY BE USED AS HEAT SHIELDS, PLACED OVER COMPONENTS SENSITIVE TO TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS, SUCH AS CRYOGENIC FLUID TANKS.  WHEN ILLUMINATED BY THE SUN, THE SHIELD CAN ASSUME A FLAT STATE, REFLECTING 98 PERCENT OF THE SUN''S ENERGY AWAY FROM THE SENSITIVE COMPONENT.  UPON ENTERING THE EARTH''S SHADOW, THE SHIELD WILL ASSUME A COMPRESSED STATE, EMITTING EXCESS HEAT ORIGINATING FROM THE SPACECRAFT INTO DEEP SPACE INSTEAD OF REFLECTING THIS HEAT ONTO THE CRYOGENIC FLUID TANK. PRELIMINARY WORK CHARACTERIZING THE BEHAVIOR OF V GROOVES WHEN EXPOSED TO RADIATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED. HOWEVER, THE BULK OF THE WORK REMAINS. THE TOTAL HEAT REJECTED FROM A FOIL SAMPLE, ACCOUNTING FOR EMITTING SURFACE AREA, MUST BE CHARACTERIZED. LIKEWISE, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FOIL AND THE SURFACE IT IS PROTECTING MUST BE DETERMINED. NEXT, AN ACTUATION SYSTEM AND FIXATION COMPONENTS MUST BE DEVELOPED. FINALLY, THE COMPLETE THERMAL SYSTEM MUST BE MODELED AND EXPERIMENTALLY PROVEN CAPABLE OF MAINTAINING THE TEMPERATURE OF A PROTECTED SURFACE UNDER VARYING HEAT LOADS. ULTIMATELY, THE PURPOSE OF THIS WORK IS TO MODEL A COMPLETE THERMAL SYSTEM INVOLVING THE USE OF A VARIABLE HEAT REJECTION SHIELD, DEVELOP THIS TECHNOLOGY TO A SPACE READY STATE AND EXPERIMENTALLY VALIDATE ITS ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE TEMPERATURE OF A PROTECTED SURFACE WHEN EXPOSED TO VARYING HEAT LOADS."

RNA, A UNIQUELY INFORMATION-DENSE AND CATALYTIC BIOMOLECULE, SITS AT THE CENTER OF THIS REQUIREMENT FOR LIFE IN ALL KNOWN BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRANSITION FROM SIMPLE CHEMICAL TO COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. AMONG RNA COMPONENTS DEFINING THE CENTRAL DOGMA, THERE IS PERHAPS NONE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE RIBOSOME, WHICH SERVES AS A CELLULAR NEXUS OF INFORMATION TRANSFER, RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND GROWTH MODULATION. CONSERVATION OF THE RIBOSOME IS USED TO TRACE EVOLUTIONARY TRAJECTORIES ACROSS THE TREE OF LIFE FROM LUCA, YET THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT RRNA-BASED PHYLOGENETIC RECONSTRUCTIONS OF INTERMEDIATE VERSIONS OF THE TRANSLATIONAL APPARATUS. METHODOLOGIES THAT ENABLE THE RECONSTRUCTION AND EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION OF ANCESTRAL RIBOSOME INTERMEDIATES ALONG PLAUSIBLE EVOLUTIONARY TRAJECTORIES TO ITS CURRENT FORM WOULD TRANSFORM OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ORIGIN OF LIFE ON EARTH, ELUCIDATE THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN RIBOSOMES, AND POTENTIALLY INFORM ROUTES FOR TRANSLATION ELSEWHERE IN THE COSMOS. MAJOR GOALS: HISTORICALLY, ORIGINS-OF-LIFE RESEARCHERS HAVE FOCUSED ON A􀁅BOTTOM-UP􀁅 APPROACH TO THE PREDICTION OF INTERMEDIATE PRE-BIOTIC BIOMOLECULES, IN WHICH ARTIFICIAL CHEMICAL SYSTEMS ARE CONSTRUCTED IN ATTEMPTS TO RECREATE CONDITIONS ON THE EARLY EARTH. CONVERSELY, A􀁅TOP-DOWN􀁅 APPROACH, IN WHICH EXISTING BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS ARE REDUCED TO THEIR UNDERLYING COMPONENTS, WOULD INFORM THE FUNCTIONAL AND MINIMAL COMPONENTS THAT MAY HAVE EXISTED IN A PREBIOTIC ERA. WE PROPOSE TO TAKE A TOP-DOWN APPROACH TO THE MINIMIZATION OF THE RIBOSOME WITHIN THE FUNCTIONALITY-RELEVANT ENVIRONMENT OF THE CELL. SUCH A COMBINATION OF THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS WOULD INFORM THE CHEMICAL FUNCTIONALITY DEFINING TRANSLATION. HOWEVER, STUDIES AIMED AT PROBING CELLULAR TRANSLATION HAVE RARELY ACCESSED SUCH A DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF THE MINIMAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSLATION. THIS IS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH RIBOSOME MANIPULATION IN VIVO, AS TRANSLATION CANNOT BE EASILY UNCOUPLED FROM CELLULAR VIABILITY OR OVERALL FITNESS. THUS, OUR PROPOSED WORK REQUIRES THE REMOVAL OF CONFOUNDING ATTRIBUTES REGULATING CELLULAR VIABILITY THAT MAY BE INCORRECTLY ASSUMED TO INFLUENCE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS BIOMOLECULAR ACTIVITY. SPECIFIC AIMS: TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, WE PROPOSE TO INTEGRATE SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY, COMPUTATIONAL AND PHYLOGENETIC RRNA ANALYSIS, AND EVOLUTIONARY PRINCIPLES TO INFORM PLAUSIBLE AND TESTABLE MINIMAL RIBOSOME INTERMEDIATES EN ROUTE TO THE EXTANT TRANSLATION MACHINERY OF THE CELL: 1. AIM I: CONSTRUCTION OF A DEFINED SENSOR THAT RECAPITULATES RIBOSOMAL ACTIVITY IN E. COLI AS A MODULAR AND ORTHOGONAL PLATFORM BY UNCOUPLING TRANSLATION FROM HOST VIABILITY. 2. AIM II: APPLICATION OF THIS SENSOR PLATFORM TOWARDS THE IN VIVO ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF RRNA TRUNCATIONS AND/OR MUTATIONS ON TRANSLATION OF A SINGULAR SYNTHETIC MRNA TRANSCRIPT. 3. AIM III: OPTIMIZATION OF MINIMIZED RRNA VARIANTS USING PHAGE-ASSISTED CONTINUOUS EVOLUTION (PACE) TO REVEAL COMPENSATORY MUTATIONS THAT ENHANCE ACTIVITY. CONCLUSION: OUR PROPOSED WORK AIMS TO OVERCOME CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH RIBOSOMAL MANIPULATION IN VIVO AND PROVIDES AN INNOVATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR THE DERIVATION OF MINIMIZED RIBOSOMES. WHILE THIS IS AN AMBITIOUS INTEGRATION OF EVOLUTIONARY PRINCIPLES AND SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY TO ILLUMINATE THE ORIGINS OF TRANSLATION, WE HOPE THAT IT WILL SUPPLEMENT THE EXISTING (BUT INCOMPLETE) MOLECULAR RECORD OF RIBOSOMAL EVOLUTION AND PROVIDE NOVEL INSIGHT INTO POTENTIAL PROTO-RIBOSOMAL GENOTYPES AND PHENOTYPES. OUR PROPOSED WORK WOULD MARK THE FIRST MAJOR EFFORT TO MINIMIZE THIS COMPLEX MACROMOLECULAR MACHINE, PROVIDING EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE FOR A POTENTIAL ROUTE TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIFE OF EARTH."

MINERALOGIC DATA SUGGEST A TRANSITION FROM PHYLLOSILICATE FORMATION AND CIRCUM-NEUTRAL PH AQUEOUS PROCESSES TO A MORE ACIDIC, WATER-LIMITED SULFATEFORMING ERA KEY TO DISCERNING THE NATURE AND CAUSES OF OBSERVED ENVIRONMENTAL TRANSITIONS ON EARLY MARS IS THE CHARACTERIZATION OF CONTINUOUS STRATIGRAPHIC SECTIONS WITH ROCK UNITS THAT SPAN THIS CRITICAL TIME INTERVAL. IT HAS BEEN HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE REGION WEST OF THE ISIDIS BASIN AT THE INTERSECTION OF SOUTHERN NILI FOSSAE AND NORTHEASTERN SYRTIS MAJOR (ALSO REFERRED TO AS NE SYRTIS) CONTAINS ROCK UNITS OF DIVERSE AQUEOUS MINERALOGY THAT TRAVERSE THE NOACHIAN-HESPERIAN AND THE ROCK UNITS ARE IN THEIR ORIGINAL STRATIGRAPHIC CONTEXT. THE STRATIGRAPHY AT NE SYRTIS SPANS THE EARLY NOACHIAN TO EARLY HESPERIAN, PRESERVING A TIME-ORDERED RECORD OF BASIN-FORMING IMPACT, EMPLACEMENT OF OLIVINE-RICH ROCK, FLUVIAL ACTIVITY, AQUEOUS ALTERATION, PLAINS VOLCANISM, AND OUTFLOW CHANNELS. THE MINERALOGY OF ALTERATION MINERALS RECORDS A CHANGE IN WATER CHEMISTRY FROM NEUTRAL TO ALKALINE PH CONDITIONS PROMOTING CLAY AND CARBONATE FORMATION TO HIGHLY ACIDIC CONDITIONS PROMOTING FORMATION OF THE MINERAL JAROSITE IN FLUIDIZED FRACTURES WITHIN LAYERED SULFATEBEARING DEPOSITS. THESE WELL-PRESERVED STRATA PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TESTING KEY HYPOTHESES REGARDING GEOLOGIC PROCESSES AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE ON EARLY MARS. DESPITE THE BROAD INTEREST IN THE NE SYRTIS AND NILI FOSSAE REGION THERE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS LEFT UNRESOLVED. WHAT IS THE NATURE OF PHYLLOSILICATE DIVERSITY ACROSS THE REGION FROM THE NORTHERN HIGHLANDS TO THE PLANS NEAR JEZERO CRATER? HOW DOES PHYLLOSILCIATE DIVERSITY VARY WITH CONTEXT (BASEMENT UNITS VS HIGHER STRATIGRAPHIC LEVELS)? WHAT IS THE DIVERSITY OF CARBONATE MINERALOGY ACROSS THE REGION AND WHAT OTHER MINERALS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DEPOSITS? DOES CARBONATE SPECTRAL PROPERTIES VARY WITH GEOLOGIC SETTING (E.G. HIGHLAND REGIONS VS LOWER ELEVATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OUTFLOW SYSTEMS)? WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE SULFATEBEARING DEPOSITS (EHLMANN AND MUSTARD, 2012) AND HOW EXTENSIVE ARE THEY? DO THEY REPRESENT FUNDAMENTAL ALTERATION OF VOLCANIC ROCKS, UPWELLING OF SUBSURFACE BRINES (E.G. ANDREWS-HANNA ET AL) OR ANOTHER PROCESS? AMONG THIS RANGE OF COMPELLING QUESTIONS WE PROPOSE TO FOCUS ON THREE KEY THRUSTS. WHAT IS THE DETAILED NATURE OF PHYLLOSILICATE DIVERSITY WITHIN THE FUNDAMENTAL UNITS IN NE SYRTIS? HOW DOES THE CHARACTER OF CARBONATE MINERALOGY VARY ACROSS THE REGION? AND WHAT IS THE MINERALOGY AND GEOLOGIC SETTING OF SULFATEBEARING DEPOSITS? THESE THREE THRUSTS STRADDLE THE PROPOSED NOACHIAN-HESPERIAN TRANSITION IN MINERALOGY AND GEOLOGY AND PREVIOUS WORK HAS SHOWN THAT THESE QUESTIONS CAN BE ADDRESSED BY MAPPING THE STRATIGRAPHY AND MINERALOGY."""

IN PARTICULAR, WE AIM TO ENGAGE SECONDARY STUDENTS THROUGH INFORMAL EDUCATION VENUES TO CONTROL AND PROGRAM STATE-OF-THEART ROBOTS, BOTH REAL AND SIMULATED, THROUGH CROWDSOURCING COMMON ROBOT TASKS, AND TO ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION IN STEM DISCIPLINES. WITH THE EMERGENCE OF ROBOTIC EXPLORATION (E.G., SPACE STATION MAINTENANCE AND MONITORING, AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE, UNDERSEA EXPLORATION), TELEOPERATION OF ROBOTS HAS BECOME A CRITICAL TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITY WITH MANY OPEN RESEARCH QUESTIONS. HOWEVER, TELEOPERATION ALONE WILL LEAD TO NEITHER OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE OF ROBOTS NOR THE BEST USE OF AN HUMAN OPERATORS COGNITIVE ABILITIES. THERE ARE TASKS THAT AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS CAN PERFORM FASTER AND MORE RELIABLY THAN DIRECT HUMAN TELEOPERATION ALONE, AND WITHOUT THE RISK OF BOREDOM. BY CONTRAST, WHILE AUTONOMOUS ROBOT FUNCTIONALITY IS ATTRACTIVE, SUCH AUTONOMY LACKS THE ADAPTIVITY IN DECISION MAKING OF ANY HUMAN OPERATOR.

THESE IMPACT GLASSES ARE SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE RECENT WORK HAS DEMONSTRATED THEIR ABILITY TO ENCAPSULATE COMPLEX  ORGANIC MATTER, PRESERVING IT FOR BILLIONS OF YEARS ON THE MARTIAN SURFACE. THUS IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THIS MATERIAL AT  BOTH ROVER AND ORBITAL SCALES.

THE KEY OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO: (1) CREATE QUENCHED GLASSES OF SYNTHESIZED BASALTIC AND ULTRAMAFIC POWDERS WITH  COMPOSITIONS CONSISTENT WITH QUANTITATIVE ELEMENTAL MEASUREMENTS OF MARTIAN METEORITES AND ROVER OBSERVATIONS, UNDER CONDITIONS  THAT APPROXIMATE NEAR-SURFACE CONDITIONS ON MARS RELEVANT TO THE IMPACT MELTING PROCESS, (2) CHARACTERIZE THESE QUENCHED `IMPACT   GLASSES WITH VISIBLE TO MID-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY TO DETERMINE THEIR SPECTRAL PROPERTIES AND DETECTION LIMITS, AND (3) USE THIS SPECTRAL  LIBRARY OF MARS-COMPOSITION GLASSES TO EVALUATE ORBITAL SPACECRAFT SPECTRA OF SUSPECTED GLASSY IMPACT MELTS PROXIMAL TO IMPACT CRATERS  ON THE SURFACE. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES WE WILL CREATE A SUITE OF SYNTHETIC POWDERS BASED ON ACTUAL MARTIAN COMPOSITIONS. THESE  POWDERS WILL BE MELTED AND INSTANTLY DROP QUENCHED IN A VERTICAL FURNACE, CAREFULLY CONTROLLING FOR OXYGEN FUGACITY. ALL SYNTHESIZED  GLASSES WILL BE MEASURED WITH REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY AT VISIBLE NEAR-INFRARED WAVELENGTHS, AND THERMAL EMISSION SPECTROSCOPY IN  THE MID INFRARED. WITH THESE MEASUREMENTS WE WILL QUANTITATIVELY DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF COMPOSITION AND OXYGEN FUGACITY ON THE  SPECTRAL PROPERTIES OF THE GLASSES. THESE MEASUREMENTS WILL ALLOW DIRECT COMPARISON WITH ORBITAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDING THE NASA  COMPACT IMAGING SPECTROMETER FOR MARS (CRISM) AND THE NASA THERMAL EMISSION SPECTROMETER (TES), PROVIDING AN INVALUABLE  LIBRARY OF LABORATORY SPECTRA FOR FUTURE STUDIES. THE ABILITY OF QUENCHED IMPACT MELTS TO CONCENTRATE AND PRESERVE BIOSIGNATURES IS  RELEVANT TO MANY NASA OBJECTIVES CENTERED ON THE SEARCH FOR SIGNS OF LIFE ON OTHER PLANETARY BODIES, SO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT CRITERIA ARE  ESTABLISHED TO PROPERLY IDENTIFY THESE MATERIALS WITH SPECTROMETERS ON ROVERS AND ORBITERS.

SUBSEQUENT TO MAGMA OCEAN SOLIDIFICATION, THE INTERIORS OF SMALL ROCKY BODIES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM, LIKE THE MOON, APPEAR NOT TO HAVE UNDERGONE EXTENSIVE CONVECTIVE MIXING.

THE FIRST PHASE OF THE STUDY WILL USE HIGH PRESSURE EXPERIMENTS TO DETERMINE THE CRYSTALLIZATION SEQUENCE OF A MODEL MMO COMPOSITION UNDER THE HIGHLY REDUCING CONDITIONS AND HIGH S CONTENTS, THOUGHT TO BE RELEVANT TO MERCURY. THIS PART OF THE STUDY WILL DETERMINE WHAT PHASES WILL CRYSTALLIZE FROM THE MAGMA OCEAN AND WHAT THEIR COMPOSITIONS ARE. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE THE FINAL COMPOSITIONAL LAYERING WITHIN THE SOLIDIFIED MMO BECAUSE 1) THE CRYSTALS WILL, IN GENERAL, NOT BE THE SAME DENSITY AS THE MAGMA AND WILL SINK OR FLOAT, AND 2) THE MMO WILL BE CONVECTING, WHICH WILL TEND TO RESIST CRYSTAL SEGREGATION.

THE RESULT WILL BE A CHEMICALLY AND PHYSICALLY CONSISTENT ESTIMATE OF THE CHEMICAL STRATIFICATION OF MERCURY''S MANTLE JUST AFTER MMO SOLIDIFICATION. THIS STRATIFICATION IS A FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTY OF THE PLANET AND GOVERNED ITS SUBSEQUENT CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL EVOLUTION. TWO ASPECTS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST ARE: 1) TO WHAT DEGREE DO SULFIDE LAYERS DEVELOP DURING SOLIDIFICATION AND 2) TO WHAT DEGREE DO THESE SULFIDE LAYERS CONCENTRATE THE HEAT PRODUCING ELEMENTS U, TH AND K.

THE NUMERICAL MODELS WILL BE BASED ON PREVIOUS MODELS DEVELOPED AT BROWN UNIVERSITY FOR LUNAR MAGMA OCEAN CRYSTALLIZATION, BUT WILL INCLUDE NEW THEORETICAL WORK ON THE PHYSICS OF CRYSTAL SEGREGATION. IN EACH TIME STEP OF THE MODEL, THE PHASE EQUILIBRIA WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE WHAT PHASES CRYSTALLIZE AND THEIR COMPOSITIONS.

THE PROPOSED WORK THEREFORE SEEKS TO ENHANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THESE AQUEOUS DRIVEN SEDIMENTARY PROCESSES IN VALLES MARINERIS THROUGH THE SYSTEMATIC SPECTRAL ANALYSIS OF PHS AND MHS. THE OVERARCHING GOALS OF THIS WORK ARE TO: 1) DETERMINE THE SPECTRAL HETEROGENEITY OF THE PHS SPECTRAL CLASS THROUGHOUT VALLES MARINERIS AND ESTABLISH SUB-CLASSES 2) CORRELATE THE MINERALOGY TO THE SUBCLASSES THROUGH QUANTITATIVE MODELLING 3) SYNTHESIZE THE MAPPED RESULTS WITH THE GEOLOGIC CONTEXT FOR THE DIFFERENT HYDROLOGIC SETTINGS IN VALLES MARINERIS TO ESTABLISH REGIONAL HYDROLOGICAL MODELS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT CHASMA.

THE CURRENT RELAB SPECTRAL DATABASE CONTAINS #tilde#24,000 SPECTRAL FILES CORRESPONDING TO #tilde#12,000 UNIQUE SAMPLES, INCLUDING A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF LUNAR AND METEORITE SAMPLES. THE LATTER ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT GIVEN PAST, RECENT AND UPCOMING MISSIONS THAT UTILIZE VIS-NIR-IR WAVELENGTHS (E.G., MARS MGS, ODYSSEY, MARS EXPRESS, MRO, CHANDRAYAAN-1, DAWN, MESSENGER, OSIRIS-REX, HAYABUSA-2 ETC.). ALL DATA COLLECTED AT RELAB HAVE BEEN PUBLICLY AVAILABLE OVER THIS TIME PERIOD AND AVAILABLE TO THE WORLD. HOWEVER, THE NEEDS OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TO EASILY SEARCH AND ACCESS THIS LARGE DATABASE HAVE GROWN TREMENDOUSLY DURING THE DIGITAL AGE AND IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE DATABASE TO EVOLVE IN ORDER TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. HERE WE PROPOSE SEVERAL IMPORTANT STEPS TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE AND IMPROVE THE USABILITY AND SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF THE VAST RELAB SPECTRAL LIBRARY. THE WORK PLAN CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THREE MAJOR TASKS: TASK 1: RESTRUCTURE EXISTING SPECTRAL DATABASE/CATALOG, CORRECT INCONSISTENCIES, AND INCORPORATE INTO A RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO PREPARE FOR INTEGRATION WITH AN ONLINE SEARCH TOOL. WHEN POSSIBLE, MISSING SAMPLE INFORMATION WILL BE ADDED TO THE DATABASE AS WELL AS AUXILIARY SAMPLE INFORMATION (CHEMISTRY, MINERALOGY, PHOTOS, ETC.). TASK 2: FORMAT ALL EXISTING SPECTRAL FILES TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH PDS4 STANDARDS AND, AFTER PEER REVIEW, DELIVER ALL EXISTING SPECTRAL DATA TO THE PDS GEOSCIENCES NODE (AT WASHINGTON UNIV. IN ST. LOUIS) FOR FORMAL ARCHIVING THROUGH NASA. OUR GOAL IS TO ESTABLISH A SYSTEM IN WHICH ALL FUTURE SPECTRAL DATA ARE MADE PDS-COMPLIANT AS THEY ARE COLLECTED, ENSURING SIMPLE AND STREAMLINED DELIVERY TO THE PDS IN FUTURE YEARS AS THE DATABASE GROWS. TASK 3: CREATE A USER-FRIENDLY ONLINE TOOL FOR SEARCHING THE RELAB DATABASE, EXAMINING SPECTRAL PLOTS, AND DOWNLOADING DATA AS DESIRED. AUXILIARY INFORMATION (E.G., CHEMISTRY, MINERALOGY, PHOTOS, JOURNAL REFERENCES) WILL BE INCLUDED WHEN AVAILABLE. THE TOOL WILL ALSO INCLUDE AN ONLINE METHOD FOR SUBMITTING SAMPLE MEASUREMENT REQUESTS AND SAMPLE INFORMATION TO RELAB. THIS TOOL WITH BE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PDS GEOSCIENCES NODE AND WILL BE MIRRORED AT BROWN UNIVERSITY. THE EXPECTED RESULT OF THIS PROJECT IS A SIGNIFICANT AND NECESSARY INCREASE IN THE ACCESSIBILITY, USABILITY, AND VISIBILITY OF THE NASA RELAB SPECTRAL DATABASE. THIS WORK IS RELEVANT TO THE PDART CALL IN THAT IT FOCUSES ON ARCHIVING OF SPECTRAL DATA AND CREATING A TOOL FOR SEARCHING AND USING THOSE DATA. ALL EXISTING SPECTRA AND AUXILIARY DATA WILL BE ARCHIVED IN THE PDS (FOLLOWING REVIEW) AT THE END OF THE AWARD PERIOD. WE WILL ALSO DEVELOP A WEB-BASED TOOL HOSTED THROUGH THE PDS AND MIRRORED AT BROWN THAT WILL ALLOW USERS EASY SEARCH AND DOWNLOAD CAPABILITIES. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE OUTSIDE THE CURRENT SCOPE OF FUNDING FOR THE RELAB FACILITY AND THE PDS GEOSCIENCES NODE, AND THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO ESTABLISHED FUNDS TO SUPPORT SUCH WORK BEYOND RESPONDING TO THIS PDART CALL."

THE EXPECTED PRODUCTS WILL BE QUANTITATIVE MINERAL MAPS OF THE SURFACE OF VESTA AND AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MINERALOGICAL CHANGES ON THE SURFACE RELATE TO HED METEORITE COMPOSITIONS. INITIAL STUDIES OF DAWN VISIBLE INFRARED SPECTROMETER (VIR) DATA HAVE FOCUSED ON QUALITATIVE COMPARISONS OF SPECTRAL FEATURES TO THOSE OBSERVED IN LAB DATA OF HOWARDITE, EUCRITE, AND DIOGENITE (HED) METEORITES, RESULTING IN ESTIMATES OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE METEORITE COMPONENTS ON VESTA S SURFACE. HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANTLY MORE INFORMATION CAN BE GAINED IF QUANTITATIVE MINERAL ABUNDANCES CAN BE DERIVED FROM SUCH DATA, ESPECIALLY AT A GLOBAL SCALE. MODAL MINERALOGY AND KNOWLEDGE OF VARIATIONS IN PYROXENE CHEMISTRY, FOR INSTANCE, CAN BE USEFUL FOR ASSESSING VARIATIONS IN EUCRITE AND DIOGENITE COMPONENT ABUNDANCES WITHIN REGIONS WHOSE SPECTRA ARE  HOWARDITE-LIKE . IN ADDITION, DETAILED MIXING MODELS THAT YIELD ACCURATE MODAL MINERALOGY CAN HELP TO IDENTIFY AREAS THAT MAY INDICATE LOWER CRUSTAL OR MANTLE COMPOSITIONS, REVEALING NEW INFORMATION ABOUT LITHOLOGIC VARIATIONS WITH DEPTH. THE MAJOR GOAL OF THIS WORK WILL BE TO PRODUCE GLOBAL MAPS OF MINERAL ABUNDANCES DERIVED FROM HAPKE AND SHKURATOV MODELS AS APPLIED TO VIR DATA AND TO DISCUSS THE IMPLICATIONS OF OBSERVED VARIATIONS IN MINERALOGY IN THE CONTEXT OF HED COMPOSITIONS AND PETROLOGIC EVOLUTION MODELS FOR VESTA. METHODS: THESE GOALS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY APPLYING RADIATIVE TRANSFER MODELS (RTMS) TO DAWN VIR DATA. A PILOT STUDY HAS BEEN CONDUCTED TO VALIDATE OUR METHODS AND DEMONSTRATE OUR ABILITY TO WORK WITH VIR DATA. TO FURTHER TEST THE VALIDITY OF HAPKE AND SHKURATOV RTMS FOR HED AND DAWN SPECTRA, WE WILL FIRST CARRY OUT ADDITIONAL LAB MEASUREMENTS OF HOWARDITE SAMPLES TO EXPAND UPON OUR EXISTING TEST DATASET THAT RELIED UPON DIOGENITE AND EUCRITE SAMPLES. THOUGH A MINOR COMPONENT, THIS INITIAL LAB WORK WILL PROVIDE A MUCH-NEEDED FOUNDATION FOR QUANTIFYING THE UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH APPLYING RTMS TO VIR SPECTRA, AN IMPORTANT STEP GIVEN THAT BRECCIAS LIKELY DOMINATE VESTA S SURFACE. SAMPLES WILL BE CHARACTERIZED BY VIS-NIR REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY AND MODAL MINERALOGY WILL BE ESTIMATED FROM XRD DATA USING RIETVELD REFINEMENT. THE BULK OF THE WORK WILL INVOLVE ANALYSIS OF DAWN DATA AND APPLICATION OF THE HAPKE AND SHKURATOV RTMS TO VIR SPECTRA USING INVERSE THEORY. ISIS SOFTWARE WILL BE USED TO PROCESS THE VIR DATA, MAP PROJECT IMAGES, AND MOSAIC INDIVIDUAL IMAGE CUBES. MATLAB SCRIPTS WILL BE USED TO APPLY OUR RTM CODES TO THE VIR DATA, RESULTING IN MODAL MINERALOGY MAPS (E.G., MAPS OF OLIVINE, PYROXENE, PLAGIOCLASE ABUNDANCE, ETC.). THE RESULTING MAPS AND SPECTRA WILL THEN BE COMPARED TO HED SPECTRA AND COMPOSITIONS TO ASSESS DIFFERENT PETROLOGIC MODELS. DAWN FRAMING CAMERA DATA WILL BE EXAMINED FOR AREAS OF SPECIAL INTEREST (E.G., HIGH OLIVINE AND/OR HIGH PYROXENE CONCENTRATIONS) TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE LOCAL GEOLOGIC CONTEXT OF THESE REGIONS. RELEVANCE: THIS WORK IS RELEVANT TO THE DDAP CALL IN THAT IT WILL ENHANCE THE SCIENTIFIC RETURN OF THE DAWN AT VESTA MISSION THROUGH THE PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS OF EXISTING DAWN VIR DATA TO PRODUCE QUANTITATIVE MINERAL MAPS OF VESTA S SURFACE. THESE MINERAL MAPS WILL BE COMPARED AGAINST SPECTRAL AND MINERALOGICAL COMPOSITIONS OF HED METEORITES TO TEST VARIOUS MODELS ABOUT THE PETROLOGIC EVOLUTION OF VESTA, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE ABUNDANCE OF EUCRITE AND DIOGENITE COMPONENTS IN REGIONS THAT ARE SPECTRALLY AKIN TO HOWARDITES. THE MAPS RESULTING FROM THIS WORK WILL BE ARCHIVED IN THE PDS FOR USE BY THE BROADER COMMUNITY."

WE PROPOSE TO MODEL THE OBSERVED GRAVITATIONAL AND TOPOGRAPHIC SIGNATURES OF LUNAR BASIN RINGS TO INVESTIGATE THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATION OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE LUNAR LITHOSPHERE.  IN TASK 1, WE WILL USE GRAIL GRAVITY DATA AND LOLA TOPOGRAPHY DATA IN ORDER TO CONSTRAIN THE SUBSURFACE STRUCTURE OF PEAK RING AND MULTI-RING BASINS. MODELS OF THE CRUSTAL STRUCTURE OF THE BASINS WILL BE USED TO QUANTIFY THE DIP AND DISPLACEMENT ACROSS INDIVIDUAL FAULTS. COMPARISONS BETWEEN BASINS AND ASYMMETRIES WITHIN INDIVIDUAL BASINS WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE SENSITIVITY OF THE RING FAULT CHARACTERISTICS TO TARGET PROPERTIES SUCH AS CRUSTAL THICKNESS AND HEAT FLOW.  IN TASK 2, WE WILL STUDY THE STRUCTURE OF THE RINGS THAT CHARACTERIZE MULTI-RING BASINS BY FORWARD MODELING THEIR GRAVITATIONAL SIGNATURES. THIS TASK WILL INCLUDE MODELING THE FORMATION OF MULTI-RING BASINS TO DETERMINE HOW THE GRAVITY SIGNATURES, LOCATIONS, SPACING, AND OFFSETS OF BASIN RINGS DEPEND ON THE THICKNESS OF THE LUNAR LITHOSPHERE, IMPACTOR SIZE, AND PRE-IMPACT CRUSTAL THICKNESS.  IN TASK 3, WE WILL COMPARE OUR FORWARD MODELS FROM TASK 2 TO THE OBSERVED GRAVITY SIGNATURES, CRUSTAL STRUCTURE DERIVED IN TASK 1, LOCATIONS, SPACING, AND OFFSETS OF THE RINGS OF OLD AND YOUNG BASINS.  IN ALL TASKS, WE WILL FOCUS ON KEY BASINS CHOSEN TO BE REPRESENTATIVE OF DISTINCTIVE IMPACT CONDITIONS. THE FIRST FOCUS OF THE WORK WILL BE ON THE ORIENTALE BASIN. ADDITIONAL ANALYSES WILL FOCUS ON THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT TARGET PROPERTIES BY COMPARING BASINS THAT DIFFER PRIMARILY IN A SINGLE KEY PARAMETER. THE EFFECT OF HEAT FLOW WILL BE INVESTIGATED LOOKING AT TWO SIMILARLY SIZED BASINS WITHIN AND OUTSIDE OF THE PKT (E.G., IMBRIUM AND ORIENTALE), OR TWO SIMILARLY SIZED BASINS FORMED IN THE PRE-NECTARIAN AND NECTARIAN/IMBRIAN (E.G., SMITHII AND ORIENTALE). THE EFFECT OF CRUSTAL THICKNESS WILL BE INVESTIGATED BY COMPARING TWO SIMILARLY SIZED BASINS IN THE THICK CRUST OF THE FARSIDE HIGHLAND AND THE THIN CRUST OF THE SOUTH POLE-AITKEN BASIN (E.G., HERTZSPRUNG AND APOLLO). THE EFFECT OF IMPACT ENERGY AND THE PEAK-RING TO MULTI-RING BASIN TRANSITION WILL BE INVESTIGATED BY FOCUSING ON BASINS OF DIFFERENT SIZE (E.G., KOROLEV, HERTZSPRUNG, AND ORIENTALE)."

CONTRIBUTING TO OUR LACK OF UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN AN INSTRUMENT PURPOSE-BUILT FOR EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERIC CHARACTERIZATION. AS A RESULT, RESEARCHERS HAVE HAD TO RELY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL TECHNIQUES IN DATA REDUCTION TO ACHIEVE HIGH PRECISION MEASUREMENTS. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN CORRECTING FOR THE INTRAPIXEL SENSITIVITY EFFECT IN THE SPITZER SPACE TELESCOPE''S WARM MISSION DATA HAVE ALLOWED OBSERVERS TO MAKE MEASUREMENTS WITH IMPROVED PRECISION. RECENT AND UPCOMING PROGRAMS BY THE SPITZER IRAC CAMERA SEEK TO MAKE USE OF THESE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS TO PUSH FORWARD INTO LONGER BASELINE HIGH PRECISION OBSERVATIONS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT TO BE PROBLEMATIC. I PROPOSE TO ANALYZE MULTIPLE SPITZER ECLIPSE AND PHASE CURVE OBSERVATIONS OF HD 209458B AND OTHER TARGETS IN BOTH THE 3.6 AND 4.5 UM BANDPASSES. I HAVE CONSTRUCTED A DATA REDUCTION PIPELINE THAT IMPLEMENTS SEVERAL OF THE MOST RECENT AND PROMISING METHODS OF INTRAPIXEL SENSITIVITY CORRECTION. THE APPLICATION OF SEVERAL RECENT OBSERVATIONAL METHODS, SUCH AS ECLIPSE MAPPING, WILL ALLOW ME TO PRODUCE 3-D THERMAL DISTRIBUTION MAPS FOR TARGETS WITH BOTH PHASE CURVE AND ECLIPSE OBSERVATIONS AT MULTIPLE WAVELENGTHS. I WILL LEVERAGE THESE RESULTS AGAINST OBSERVATIONS USING OTHER OBSERVATORIES SUCH AS THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE TO PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE PLANETARY ENERGY BUDGET AS WELL AS RADIATIVE, ADVECTIVE, AND CHEMICAL TIMESCALES OF HOT JUPITER ATMOSPHERES. OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THESE PROPERTIES AND THE ROBUSTNESS OF GENERAL CIRCULATION MODELS IS LIMITED BY THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZE OF PUBLISHED DATA.

THREE END-MEMBER MECHANISMS FOR PRODUCING TRANSIENT HEATING IN A  COLD AND ICY  CLIMATE, PERMITTING TRANSIENT MELTING OF THE ICE SHEET AND SUBSEQUENT RUNOFF, INCLUDE IMPACT CRATERING, VOLCANISM, AND GREENHOUSE WARMING (E.G. H2 THROUGH SERPENTINIZATION). THE GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO EXPLORE ALL THREE OF THESE MECHANISMS WITH THE LABORATORIE DE METEOROLOGIE GLOBAL CLIMATE MODEL (LMD GCM). WE WILL INTRODUCE ALL THREE MECHANISMS INTO THE GCM AND TEST THE APPLICABILITY OF THESE MECHANISMS FOR PRODUCING SUFFICIENT FLUVIAL AND LACUSTRINE ACTIVITY TO FORM THE VALLEY NETWORKS AND LAKES. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL FOCUS ON THE VOLUME, DISTRIBUTION, AND RUNOFF RATES OF (1) MELTWATER PRODUCED FROM TRANSIENT MELTING OF THE ICE SHEET AND (2) RAINFALL FOR MECHANISMS THAT RAISE TEMPERATURES SUFFICIENTLY TO INTRODUCE TRANSIENT RAINFALLS.
