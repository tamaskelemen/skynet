HOWEVER, GOLDILOCKS ISN&#039;T SIMPLY ABOUT TEMPERATURE. IT&#039;S ABOUT PORRIDGE. WHAT KIND OF TELESCOPE CAN SENSE HOME COOKING WITHIN THE HABITABLE ZONES OF OUR STELLAR NEIGHBORHOOD? THE EXTRAORDINARY DEMANDS MADE BY EXOPLANET DISCOVERY INCLUDE TELESCOPE APERTURES OF UNPRECEDENTED ANGULAR RESOLUTION AND SENSITIVITY. HOWEVER, THAT BALLGAME CANNOT EVEN BEGIN WITHOUT A METHOD TO OCCLUDE OR NULL THE HOST STAR AND REMOVE ITS GLARE. AS IF THAT WERE NOT TROUBLE ENOUGH, HABITABLE PLANET DISCOVERY NECESSITATES EXQUISITE SPECTROGRAPHIC CAPABILITY. THE NECESSITY IS NOT LOST ON NASA. THE DECADAL SURVEY OF ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS MAKES IT QUITE CLEAR THAT EXOPLANET DISCOVERY MUST INCLUDE A SPECTROSCOPY COMPONENT. YET THERE ARE NO EXISTING HABITABLE PLANET ZONE FINDERS WITH SPECTROGRAPHS AND FEW ARE PLANNED. HOMES (HOLOGRAPHIC OPTICAL METHOD FOR EXOPLANET SPECTROSCOPY) IS A SPACE TELESCOPE DESIGNED TO HIT ALL OF THESE CRITERIA. ITS DOUBLE DISPERSION ARCHITECTURE EMPLOYS A HOLOGRAPHIC OPTICAL ELEMENT AS A PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IN CONJUNCTION WITH A NOVEL SECONDARY SPECTRAL INTERFEROMETER. UNLIKE MIRRORS AND LENSES, THE HOLOGRAMS ARE THIN AND FLAT. THEY CAN BE FABRICATED ON THIN GOSSAMER MEMBRANES AND STRETCHED OVER SPACE FRAMES COVERING THOUSANDS OF SQUARE METERS. THIS PROVIDES THE SCALE OF COLLECTOR NEEDED TO CAPTURE THE PHOTONS FROM VERY FAINT SOURCES LIKE EXOPLANETS AND BRING THEM TO A FOCUS. BECAUSE HOLOGRAPHIC OPTICS FOCUS BY THE PROCESS OF DISPERSION, THEY ARE INTRINSICALLY SPECTROGRAPHIC PROVIDING A WEALTH OF DETAIL ABOUT THE COMPOSITION OF THE IMAGES THEY FORM. ADD TO THIS A NOVEL NOTCH FILTER TO DIM THE STAR THAT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE SPECTROGRAPHIC IMAGE, AND HOMES IS A CONCEPT THAT ADDRESSES THE DEMANDING SPECIFICATIONS OF A TELESCOPE TO FIND HABITABLE PLANETS WITHIN 30 LIGHT YEARS OF EARTH.",,,,,,,,,,,,

HIADS OFFER CONSIDERABLE SYSTEM MASS AND VOLUME SAVINGS OVER RIGID AEROSHELL TECHNOLOGY.  TO ADVANCE HIAD DEVELOPMENT AND IDENTIFY TECHNICAL CHALLENGES WITH DEVELOPMENT OF A 10 METER CLASS OF HIAD, TESTING OF INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS IS NEEDED TO MEET PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR POTENTIAL FLIGHT DEMONSTRATIONS.  ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS DEVELOPING SOFT-GOOD MATERIALS AND FABRICS FOR A DEPLOYABLE THERMAL PROTECTION SYSTEM (TPS).  THIS STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) DEFINES A FABRICATION EFFORT TO BE PERFORMED BY THE CONTRACTOR THAT WILL DEMONSTRATE AN ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE A LOW-ANGLE BIASED TWO DIMENSIONAL FABRIC THROUGH A BRAIDING PROCESS THAT OTHERWISE CANNOT BE ACHIEVED USING A STANDARD FABRIC WEAVING PROCESS. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO ESTABLISH A MANUFACTURING METHOD THAT USES BRITTLE SILICON CARBIDE CERAMIC YARNS TO OBTAIN A NOMINAL +/- 60  BIASED BIAXIAL BRAIDED TUBE WITH A DIAMETER OF 24 INCHES OF SUFFICIENT LENGTH TO MANUFACTURE A DEPLOYABLE TPS WITH A DIAMETER OF AT LEAST 20 FEET. THE WORK DETAILED HEREIN IS DEFINED AS A SUBSCALE MANUFACTURING EFFORT THAT WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING INDUSTRY STANDARD BRAIDING METHODS AND EQUIPMENT TO OBTAIN A REFRACTORY CLOTH OF LENGTH AND QUALITY SUFFICIENT FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF A DEPLOYABLE TPS.  2.0",OBJECTIVES  THE CONTRACTOR SHALL IDENTIFY AND DEMONSTRATE BRAID FABRICATION METHODS BASED ON THE REQUIREMENTS IN THIS SOW.  THE CONTRACT SCOPE OF WORK SHALL INCLUDE THE TASKS LISTED BELOW.  THE DETAILED TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THESE TASKS ARE PROVIDED IN TASKS 3.2 AND 3.4 OF THIS SOW.  SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF TASK 3.2 IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION TO PROCEED TO TASK 3.4.  THE GOVERNMENT DECISION WHETHER OR NOT TO PROCEED WITH TASK 3.4 WILL BE PROVIDED FOLLOWING THE MIDTERM CONTRACT REVIEW TASK 3.3.  THE SOW FOR THE HIAD ADVANCED LARGE-SCALE BRAIDING DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION SOW INCLUDE TECHNICAL TASKS IDENTIFIED AS:  3.1,KICK-OFF MEETING 3.2,SUBSCALE BRAIDED FABRIC 3.3,MIDTERM CONTRACT REVIEW 3.4,LARGE SCALE BRAIDED FABRIC 3.5,FINAL CONTRACT REVIEW    3.0,"TASK TECHNICAL DETAILS  THE PRIMARY WORK PROVIDED FOR IN THE CONTRACT IS DIVIDED INTO TWO MAJOR TASKS FOR THE PURPOSE OF, FIRST DEMONSTRATING PROOF OF CONCEPT THROUGH A PRELIMINARY FABRICATION TRIAL USING A LOWER TEMPERATURE CAPABLE CANDIDATE CERAMIC YARN MATERIAL, AND SECOND, EXTENDING THOSE CAPABILITIES SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED AND DEMONSTRATED TO A HIGHER TEMPERATURE CAPABLE SILICON CARBIDE YARN.  THE LOWER TEMPERATURE CANDIDATE YARN SHALL BE NEXTELTM 440 WHICH HAS BEEN CHOSEN BECAUSE IT IS A LOWER COST MATERIAL THAT POSSESSES MECHANICAL AND MANUFACTURING DURABILITY PROPERTIES COMPARABLE TO A HIGHER TEMPERATURE CAPABLE, AND HIGHER COST CG-NICALONTM YARN.  THE SUBSCALE BRAIDED FABRIC TASK 3.2 ADDRESSES THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BRAIDING BRITTLE CERAMIC YARNS.  SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF TASK 3.2 IS REQUIRED TO ASSESS THE PROBABILITY OF SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING THE LARGE-SCALE BRAIDING TASK 3.4.  AN EXAMINATION OF THE PROGRESS PERFORMED DURING THE SUBSCALE BRAIDED TASK 3.2 SHALL BE CONDUCTED THROUGH A MID-TERM REVIEW.  FOLLOWING SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE TASKS 3.2 AND 3.3, THE GOVERNMENT WILL ASSESS THE RISKS TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING TASK 3.4 AND MAKE A DECISION ON EXECUTING TASK 3.4.  THE CONTRACTOR MUST HAVE A WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION TO PROCEED FROM THE GOVERNMENT BEFORE EXECUTING WORK UNDER THE LARGE-SCALE BRAIDED FABRIC TASK 3.4.  3.1","KICK-OFF MEETING WITHIN 7 DAYS OF THE CONTRACT AWARD DATE, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PARTICIPATE IN A KICK-OFF MEETING THAT WILL BE HELD VIA TELEPHONE AND WEB CONFERENCING.  THE PURPOSE OF THE KICK-OFF MEETING IS TO PROVIDE A FORUM AT WHICH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE CONTRACTOR CAN REVIEW THE DETAILED REQUIREMENTS DESCRIBED IN THIS SOW.  THE CONTRACTOR IS NOT REQ""",,,

IN THIS HYBRID APPROACH, THE CONVENTIONAL METALLIC WEB IS REPLACED WITH A COMPOSITE ELEMENT. THIS ALTERNATIVE DESIGN GENERATES A SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT REDUCTION AND THE POTENTIAL FOR THE REDUCTION OF NOISE AND VIBRATION. THE PHASE 2 PROGRAM WILL MAKE THE FIRST LARGE SCALE HYBRID GEARS THAT CAN BE RUN IN A ROTATING GEAR RIG WITH IMPOSED TORQUE LOADING. SEVERAL FULL SCALE GEARS WILL BE MADE AS WELL AS FULL SCALE TEST ELEMENTS. TEST RESULTS FROM FULL SCALE TESTING WILL BE APPLIED TO COMPUTER SIMULATION MODELS. THIS EFFORT WILL APPLY TOPOLOGY OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES TO PREDICT THE BEST DESIGN OF THE GEAR ELEMENTS. THIS SHOULD ENABLE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EFFICIENT DESIGNS THAN THOSE FABRICATED AND TESTED IN THE PHASE 1 PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM WILL ALSO EXPLORE A POWER TRANSMISSION SYSTEM THAT INTEGRATES GEAR AND SHAFT INTO A SINGLE STRUCTURE. IT IS HOPED THAT THIS INTEGRATED SYSTEM WILL BENEFIT WEIGHT, NOISE AND TOLERANCE OF MISALIGNMENTS.",,,,,,,,,,,,

NASA ESTIMATES THAT THE CURRENT MARS TO EARTH TRANSFER RATE OF 6 MBPS MIGHT BE INCREASED TO 600MBPS USING A LASER COMM (LC) SYSTEM. BECAUSE THE LC BEAM IS LESS THAN 10 MICRORADIANS WIDE AND THE EARTH AT APOGEE IS 32 MICRORADIANS WIDE, AS SEEN FROM MARS, LC BEAM JITTER CAUSED BY SPACECRAFT BASE MOTION MUST BE REDUCED TO SUB-MICRORADIAN LEVELS TO ENABLE BEACONLESS OPTICAL BEAM POINTING. TO MEET THE NEED, NASA IS SEEKING INNOVATIVE COMPACT, LIGHTWEIGHT, SPACE-QUALIFIABLE VIBRATION ISOLATION PLATFORMS FOR PAYLOADS MASSING BETWEEN 3 AND 50 KG THAT REQUIRE LESS THAN 15 W OF POWER AND MASS LESS THAN 3 KG THAT WILL ATTENUATE AN INTEGRATED ANGULAR DISTURBANCE OF 150 UR TO LESS THAN 0.5 MICRORADIANS (1-SIGMA), FROM<0.1 HZ TO #tilde#500 HZ. ATA HAS A LONG TRACK RECORD OF PRODUCING STABILIZED PLATFORMS TO HOST SMALL OPTICAL PAYLOADS. BUILDING ON A PREVIOUS NASA SBIR, ATA NOW PRODUCES THE STABLE PLATFORM USED IN NASA\'S LLST AND LCRD PROGRAMS. ATA WILL CREATE A COMPACT, LIGHTWEIGHT ISOLATION PLATFORM (CLIP) THAT COULD HOST THE LC COLLIMATOR TELESCOPE AND PROVIDE A STABILIZED PLATFORM TO PREVENT THE 150-MICRORADIAN SPACECRAFT DISTURBANCE ENVIRONMENT FROM REACHING THE LC TERMINAL. ADVANCES IN THE SUSPENSION FLEXURE, THE PLATFORM STRUCTURE, AND ACTUATORS WILL BE REQUIRED TO MEET THE SIZE, WEIGHT AND POWER REQUIREMENTS. ONE CHALLENGING REQUIREMENT IS THAT AN ANGULAR-MOTION SENSOR IS REQUIRED FOR THE CONTROL SYSTEM. GYROS EXIST THAT CAN MEASURE ADEQUATELY BUT THEY ARE TOO HEAVY, TOO LARGE, AND USE TOO MUCH POWER. ATA WILL DEVELOP A SMALL, LIGHTWEIGHT, NANORADIAN-CLASS ANGULAR NOISE CAPACITIVE ANGULAR POSITION SENSOR (CAPS). THE SENSOR WILL HAVE LOW POWER AND HIGH RELIABILITY, WHICH ATA WILL DEMONSTRATE BY PRODUCING TRL 4 PROTOTYPES IN PHASE I.

WHILE THE PAYLOAD FORMOST STABLE PLATFORMS IS ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE PLATFORM OVERALL MASS, THE CLIP PAYLOAD MUST BEFROM MORE THAN HALF (3 KG) TO AS MUCH AS 94 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL PLATFORM MASS (3-50 KG PAYLOAD + 3 KG PLATFORM). COMBINED WITH THE LARGE PAYLOAD RANGE, THE NEEDED DISTURBANCE REJECTION FROM 150- MICRORADIAN TO LESS THAN 0.5-MICRORADIAN ACROSS THE BROAD FREQUENCY RANGE OF 0.1 TO 500 HZ REQUIRES INNOVATION IN THE PLATFORM SUSPENSION, HIGH-PERFORMANCE ACTUATORS, SERVO CONTROLS, AND STRUCTURE.

THIS HAS RESULTED IN WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE \COMMUNICATION GAP\"" FOR COMMUNICATION-BOUND HPC APPLICATIONS: THEIR COMMUNICATION-TO-COMPUTATION TIME-RATIO IS SO LARGE, THAT THE PROCESSORS REMAIN MOSTLY SUB-UTILIZED, WITH LOTS OF \""DISPOSABLE\"" FLOPS AVAILABLE. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, SCIENTISTS HAVE PROPOSED TO USE THESE DISPOSABLE FLOPS (WHICH OTHERWISE WOULD BE WASTED IDLING) TO COMPRESS AND DECOMPRESS THE COMMUNICATED DATA SO TO EFFECTIVELY SPEED UP THE UNDERLYING APPLICATION.  ALTHOUGH THE IDEA BEARS TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL, EFFORTS IN THIS DIRECTION HAVE CONSISTENTLY RENDERED VERY POOR RESULTS, WITH TYPICAL RESULTING SPEEDUPS AVERAGING BELOW 1.5X. IN THIS PROJECT, WE IDENTIFY THE STRONGEST REASONS WHY TRADITIONAL DATA COMPRESSION HAS FALLEN SHORT IN TERMS OF SPEEDUP PERFORMANCE FOR HPC, AND PROPOSE NOVEL TECHNIQUES PARTICULARLY CRAFTED FOR GROUNDBREAKING PERFORMANCE WITHIN THE HPC FRAMEWORK. PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW THAT THESE TECHNIQUES BREAK THE 10X SPEEDUP MARKUP CONSISTENTLY FOR A WIDE CLASS OF HPC APPLICATIONS OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE TO NASA. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP THE THEORY AND METHODS BEHIND THESE TECHNIQUES, WHICH ULTIMATELY WILL RESULT INTO A LIBRARY PRODUCT FOR TRANSPARENT ACCELERATION OF HPC COMMUNICATION PLATFORMS, SUCH AS MPI.

IN PHASE I WEDISCOVERED A NEW THEORY OF DATA COMPRESSION WITH UNPRECEDENTED CAPABILITY TO REDUCE DATA MOVEMENT IN DISTRIBUTED HPC APPLICATIONS. PHASE I RESULTS INCLUDE: 1) THE DEMONSTRATION VIA PROOF-OF-CONCEPT PROTOTYPES OF LOSSLESS COMPRESSIVE GAINS OF 4X-20X FOR NAS PARALLEL BENCHMARKS, AND 2) THE FORMULATION OF COPA, A COMPRESSION OPPORTUNITIES AUDITING&DISCOVERY PROCESS THAT FACILITATES THE ANALYSIS OF ANY GIVEN LARGE-SCALE CODE WITH THE PURPOSE OF OPTIMIZING IT FOR PERFORMANCE VIA DATA MOVEMENT REDUCTION. PHASE II TARGETS THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE NEW THEORY THROUGH TWO MAJOR THRUSTS: 1) THE DEVELOPMENT OFSOFTWARE THAT FACILITATES INTEGRATING HIGH-YIELD COMPRESSION INTO HPC CODES, AND 2) THE FURTHER INFUSIONOF THE TECHNOLOGY INTO NASA APPLICATIONS. THRUST 1 WILL PRODUCE A FULLY FUNCTIONAL PROTOTYPE OF A SOFTWARE SUITE FOR THE AUTOMATIC/SEMI-AUTOMATIC ACCELERATION OF HPC CODES VIA COMPRESSION. THE PROTOTYPE WILL INCORPORATE EASE-OF-INFUSION FEATURES (E.G., MPI-ENABLED COMPRESSION AND DECOMPRESSION ROUTINES), AS WELL AS ERGONOMIC FEATURES THAT ALLOW THE SEAMLESS INTEGRATION OF NEW COMPRESSIONMODULES INTO THE SUITE. THRUST 2 WILL BEGIN WITH THE APPLICATION OF THE CHAPTER 1 OF COPA TO FIVE HPC CODES OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO NASA, NAMELY CART3D, FUN3D, USM3D, ENZO, AND WRF.

Research will be conducted in the Brazilian and Peruvian Amazon, at sites near Manaus and Iquitos. Activities will build on and extend research conducted under NASA-funded LBA projects. Current approaches for sampling tropical tree diversity rely on field investigations that sample only a small portion of key environmental gradients. This project will bring together a close coupling of extensive field measurements of tree diversity patterns, satellite remote sensing to enable sampling across regional disturbance gradients, and community simulation models to better understand the mechanisms responsible for observed patterns at regional scales. The overarching hypothesis is that tree species community assembly patterns at the landscape scale, driven by episodic disturbance events, differ significantly from community assembly patterns at the local (<100 ha) scale. The project has four major goals: First, episodic tree mortality disturbance will be mapped over large Amazon landscapes using Landsat imagery, enabling the development of disturbance chronosequences covering more than 20 years. Second, the chronosequence data will be used to direct extensive field sampling to quantify tree species patterns across the landscape as a function of disturbance intensity, and time since disturbance. Third, the detection threshold for shifts in PFTs from the competitor to colonizer guild will be explored using hyperspectral (Hyperion) imagery. Fourth, a tractable community assembly model will be developed to explore which community assemblage mechanisms best fit the observed landscape-level patterns. Results will provide an improved understanding of shifts in tree diversity and PFTs with disturbance, and will help inform future NASA missions including DESDynI and HyspIRI. This project will directly address the stated goal of better understanding the current condition of Amazon forest biodiversity, and how it is changing over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,

AS OUR EXPERIENCE OF VLBI HARDWARE UPGRADE SHOWED, IMPROVEMENT OF OBSERVING HARDWARE ALONE IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR IMPROVING THE ACCURACY OF STATION POSITION DETERMINATION. REACHING THE GOAL OF THE GLOBAL GEODETIC OBSERVING SYSTEM FOR THE ACCURACY OF THE INTERNATIONAL TERRESTRIAL REFERENCE FRAME (ITRF) 1 MM AND ITS STABILITY 0.1 MM/YR SET IN THE DOCUMENT &quot;MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF A GLOBAL SOCIETY ON A CHANGING PLANET IN 2020&quot; NECESSARILY REQUIRES A BREAKTHROUGH IN MODELING THE PATH DELAY IN THE NEUTRAL ATMOSPHERE. THE ESSENCE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR COMPUTING PATH DELAY THROUGH THE NEUTRAL ATMOSPHERE BY DIRECT INTEGRATION OF EQUATIONS OF RADIO WAVE PROPAGATION USING THE OUTPUT OF NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS OF A NEW GENERATION: REANALYSIS MODEL MERRA, OPERATIONAL MODEL GEOS-5.6 DEVELOPED AT THE NASA GLOBAL MODELING AND ASSIMILATION OFFICE, AND THE CLIMATE FORECAST SYSTEM REANALYSIS DEVELOPED BY NOAA. THE PATH DELAYS WILL BE COMPUTED IN THE FORM THAT CAN BE EASILY UTILIZED BY EXISTING SOFTWARE FOR PROCESSING VLBI, GPS, AND DORIS OBSERVATIONS. THE GOAL IS TO MODEL THE ATMOSPHERE PATH DELAY BETTER AND TO PROVIDE MORE RELIABLE ESTIMATES OF STATION POSITIONS AND SATELLITE ORBITS. OUR APPROACH HINGES ON A SOLUTION OF THREE PROBLEMS THAT WE FOUND IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE PILOT STUDY. THIS INCLUDES 1) DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFICIENT NUMERICAL ALGORITHM FOR EXPANDING THE REFRACTIVITY FIELD OVER A FOUR-DIMENSIONAL TENSOR PRODUCT OF B-SPLINES THAT TRANSFORMS A SET OF DISCRETE REFRACTIVITIES DERIVED FROM THE GRIDDED OUTPUT OF NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS INTO A CONTINUUM FUNCTION WITH SMOOTH PARTIAL DERIVATIVES. 2) FORMULATION OF RADIO WAVE PROPAGATION THROUGH A HETEROGENEOUS CONTINUOUS MEDIUM AS A VARIATIONAL PROBLEM WHICH SOLUTION IS REDUCED TO A SYSTEM OF NON-LINEAR ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF THE 4TH ORDER. 3) DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFICIENT INTERPOLATION METHOD FOR SLANTED PATH DELAYS COMPUTED FOR A GIVEN STATION. THAT ALLOWS TO DECOUPLE COMPUTATION OF PATH DELAY IN THE NEUTRAL ATMOSPHERE FROM GEODETIC DATA ANALYSIS. ALTHOUGH THE NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS CURRENTLY ARE NOT ACCURATE TO THE LEVEL THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO COMPUTE PATH DELAY WITH THE ACCURACY THAT MATCHES THE ACCURACY OF SPACE GEODESY MEASUREMENTS, THEIR USE SHIFTS THE PARADIGM OF A TREATMENT OF PATH DELAY IN THE NEUTRAL ATMOSPHERE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED OVER 40 YEARS AGO. INSTEAD OF USING IN-SITU SURFACE METEOROLOGICAL DATA THAT PROVIDE ESTIMATES OF ZENITH PATH DELAYS WITH A TYPICAL ERROR OF 150-250 MM AND ESTIMATING THE REMAINING DELAYS USING PARTIAL DERIVATIVES, THE SO-CALLED MAPPING FUNCTION, DERIVED FROM A COARSE REGRESSION MODEL, WE CAN COMPUTE THE SLANTED PATH DELAY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE OBSERVING SOURCE OR SATELLITE WITH THE ACCURACY OF 10-15 MM OF THE ZENITH PATH DELAY EQUIVALENT AND TO ESTIMATE RESIDUAL DELAY USING PARTIAL DERIVATIVES COMPUTED FROM THE NUMERICAL WEATHER MODEL. ADVANCES IN NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS WILL MAKE UNNECESSARY ESTIMATION OF PATH DELAY CAUSED BY THE NEUTRAL ATMOSPHERE IN THE FUTURE WHEN EVEN MORE PRECISE NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS WILL BE DEVELOPED. THE PRESENT PROPOSAL SETS THE PATH FOR SUCH A SHIFT IN DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE. THE BENEFITS THAT WE CAN ENJOY RIGHT NOW ARE REDUCING SYSTEMATIC ERRORS ORIGINATING FROM THE A PRIORI MAPPING FUNCTION AND SATISFACTORY MODELING OF THE PATH DELAY AZIMUTHAL DEPENDENCE THAT MAKES ESTIMATION OF THE SO-CALLED TROPOSPHERE GRADIENTS UNNECESSARY. THIS WILL RESULT IN IMPROVEMENT OF STATION POSITION REPEATABILITY AND GETTING A MORE ACCURATE TERRESTRIAL REFERENCE FRAME AND SATELLITE ORBITS.

(CUAHSI), CURRENTLY WITH 112 MEMBERS PLUS 23 AFFILIATES, AND RELEVANT DATA SETS AT THE GODDARD EARTH SCIENCES DATA AND INFORMATION SERVICES CENTER (GES DISC). CUAHSI HAS DEVELOPED THE HYDROLOGIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (HIS), WHICH IS BUILT ON INTERNATIONAL GEOSPATIAL STANDARDS, WITH ONE OF ITS AIMS TO BRIDGE THE DIVIDE. THE HIS IS HEAVILY USED. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, E.G., THE NUMBER OF REQUESTS TO HIS PER YEAR HAS AVERAGED MORE THAN 2.25 MILLION (T. WHITEAKER, CUAHSI HIS, PERSONAL COMMUNICATION, MAY 27, 2011). GES DISC HAS A LONG HISTORY OF SUPPORTING ENERGY AND WATER CYCLE DATA SETS, REPRESENTED BY TWO OF ITS DISCIPLINE-ORIENTED ENTITIES, PRECIPITATION DISC (PDISC) AND HYDROLOGY DISC (HDISC). GES DISC HOLDS SOME 2.0 PETABYTES OF ATMOSPHERE, OCEAN, AND HYDROLOGY DATA, FROM 12 MAJOR MISSIONS AND  OZENS OF INSTRUMENTS, SERVING MORE THAN 100,000 USERS. THE OPPORTUNITY COSTS OF THE DIVIDE ARE HIGH. IT HAS LARGELY PREVENTED THE ROUTINE ACCESS AND USE OF NASA EARTH SCIENCES DATA BY THE HYDROLOGICAL AND, MORE GENERALLY, GEOSPATIAL COMMUNITY.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

THESE DATA RODS WEB SERVICES, HOWEVER, THOUGH VISIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE HIS AND THROUGH THE GODDARD EARTH SCIENCES DATA AND INFORMATION SERVICES CENTER (GES DISC), ARE NOT EASILY DISCOVERABLE BY USERS OF OTHER NON-NASA DATA SYSTEMS. THIS IS ALSO THE CASE FOR NASA EOSDIS (EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEM DATA INFORMATION SYSTEM) DATA, IN GENERAL. CONVERSELY, THERE ARE VAST AMOUNTS OF NON-NASA HYDROLOGICAL DATA (E.G., THOSE ACCESSIBLE VIA WEB SERVICES FROM CUAHSI HIS) THAT ARE NOT VISIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE FROM NASA SYSTEMS, SUCH AS THE SIMPLE SUBSET WIZARD (SSW), A COMMON GATEWAY TO DATA ARCHIVED AT NASA DATA CENTERS. THE GLOBAL EARTH OBSERVATION SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS (GEOSS), AS A CATALOG OF CATALOGS, WOULD BE A LOGICAL MECHANISM FOR PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE TIME SERIES COVERAGES OF THE DATA RODS, AS WELL AS ON-THE-FLY TIME SERIES CONVERTED FROM OTHER EOSDIS DATA, COMMONLY ARCHIVED IN THE TIME-STEP ARRAY FORMAT. THERE IS A JUST-BEGUN MULTI-ORGANIZATIONAL GEOSS ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTATION PILOT PHASE-6 (AIP-6) WATER SERVICES PROJECT (WITH PARTICIPANTS THAT INCLUDE MEMBERS OF THIS ACCESS PROPOSAL TEAM) THAT IS AIMED AT THE GEOSS WATER STRATEGIC TARGET  TO PRODUCE [BY 2015] COMPREHENSIVE SETS OF DATA AND INFORMATION PRODUCTS TO SUPPORT DECISION-MAKING FOR EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF THE WORLD''S WATER RESOURCES, BASED ON COORDINATED, SUSTAINED OBSERVATIONS OF THE WATER CYCLE ON MULTIPLE SCALES.  THE SCOPE OF THE WATER SERVICES PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A GLOBAL REGISTRY OF WATER DATA, MAP AND MODELING SERVICES CATALOGUED USING THE STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES OF THE OPEN GEOSPATIAL CONSORTIUM AND THE WORLD METEOROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION. THIS AIP-6 PROJECT BUILDS ON THE RESULTS OF AIP-5, FOR WHICH A GLOBAL PUBLICATION OF FEDERATED OBSERVATION SERVICES FOR STREAMFLOW WAS SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED. THE INDIVIDUAL WEB FEATURE SERVICES ARE REGISTERED WITH THE GEOSS COMMON INFRASTRUCTURE (GCI) AND SHOWN TO BE DISCOVERABLE THEREIN. EACH FEATURE IN A MAP SERVICE DESCRIBES ONE OBSERVED TIME SERIES ACCESSIBLE AT ONE LOCATION AND, IF AVAILABLE, CONTAINS A LINK TO THAT TIME SERIES SERVICE. FURTHERMORE, IT HAS SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT THIS INFRASTRUCTURE CAN ALSO BE ADAPTED TO PROVIDE TIME SERIES ACCESS TO MODEL GRID INFORMATION (E.G., NLDAS, GLDAS) OR GRIDS OF INFORMATION OVER A GEOGRAPHIC DOMAIN FOR A PARTICULAR TIME INTERVAL. THESE PROTOTYPE EFFORTS HAVE SHOWN THE POTENTIAL FOR ENHANCING DISCOVERY, SEARCH, AND ACCESS OF NASA DATA BY NON- NASA USERS. THAT THESE PROTOTYPES HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT THE PROPOSED WORK CAN BE SIMILARLY CARRIED OUT AND WITH LOW RISK. THE OVERALL APPROACH OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT COMPRISES THE FOLLOWING: 1. LEVERAGE SIMPLE SUBSET WIZARD (SSW) API AND ECHO 2. REGISTER DATA RODS AND ON-THE-FLY (OTF) CONVERTED TIME SERIES SERVICES IN GEOSS 3. DEVELOP WEB FEATURE SERVICES (WFS) FOR DATA RODS AND OTF CONVERTED TIME SERIES 4. ENHANCE METADATA IN WFS 5. MAKE NON-NASA DATA VISIBLE TO NASA USERS BY LEVERAGING SSW 6. DEVELOP HYDROLOGICAL USE CASES TO GUIDE PROJECT DEPLOYMENT AND SERVE AS METRICS",,,,,,,,,,,,

ARTERIAL HEAT PIPES ARE THE DEFAULT DESIGN FOR SPACECRAFT NUCLEAR REACTORS; HOWEVER, DE-PRIMING OF THE ARTERY DUE TO RADIATION IS A SERIOUS POTENTIAL PROBLEM. GROOVED AND SELF-VENTING ARTERIAL HEAT PIPES ARE LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO DE-PRIMING SINCE THE LIQUID IN THE GROOVES IS OPEN TO THE VAPOR SPACE AND THE SELF-VENTING ARTERIAL HEAT PIPE HAS VENTING PORES IN THE EVAPORATOR TO ALLOW TRAPPED VAPOR TO ESCAPE.

While high bypass ratio turbofans brought significant improvements to aircraft propulsion, the future will require the use of a different propulsion technology. Turbo-electric propulsion shows great potential to address all the N+3 objectives through the use of electrically driven fans allowing for distributed propulsion. Turbofans are replaced in this approach by ducted fans driven by high power density electric motors. The electrical power is generated by a gas turbine coupled to a high speed, high power density generator. However, the turbo-electric propulsion concept relies on the availability of electric machines with power densities (kW/m3) and specific power (kW/kg) far larger than that of conventional electric machines. Fully superconducting rotating machines have the potential to match the requirements of turbo-electric propulsion and present enabling technology for this application. Superconducting machines require operation at cryogenic temperature that can be achieved by using closed-cycle cryocoolers or liquid cryogen flow such as liquid hydrogen (LH2) that could also be used as energy carrier for propulsion. The development of turbo-electric propulsion for aircrafts requires accurate sizing of superconducting machines and performing the pertinent trade-off analysis to determine the optimum materials and operating temperature. NASA is currently using sizing models for superconducting machines developed by Dr. and his colleagues. These models were developed as part of the NASA URETI on Aeropropulsion Power and Technology (UAPT) and at the Advanced Magnet Lab (AML). The existing models are based on analytical modeling of electric machines published by Miller and Hughes and estimates of the mass of the different components of the machines assuming a given active length. Important AC loss calculations in this model are based on experimental data available in the literature AC losses in superconducting stators are very challenging to estimate as the rotating field from the rotor is phase shifted relative to the phase current which depends on the angular stator position. Furthermore, the magnitude of the applied field is not uniformly distributed, and the armature reaction tends to demagnetize the machine impacting the AC losses. While the outstanding potential of the turbo-electric propulsion has been successfully demonstrated through a few projects, higher fidelity models are needed to perform a more accurate assessment at the system level. AML proposes to develop the next generation of sizing model based on a complete 3D analysis of superconducting machines using semi-analytical methods to calculate the magnetic flux density distribution including all components of the machine. The model will include all relevant areas of design including electromagnetics, thermodynamics and mechanics. Based on semi-analytical methods, the model will enable rapid calculations as needed for system optimization. The model to be developed will be fully validated, first numerically using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and finally experimentally using a superconducting machine developed at AML. Some aspects of fully superconducting machines including the AC losses and the fault behavior have not been sufficiently studied in the past to build reliable models. We therefore propose to focus the experimental validation on those important aspects: The proposed physics-based model will allow to design and optimize aircrafts based on turbo-electric propulsion, which is the first step towards the development of the next generation of more efficient aircrafts with reduced toxic emissions and noise pollution. Such aircrafts would also allow take-off and landing during the night in cities and would dramatically reduce the cost of operation and maintenance.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Such an architecture enhances the adaptability and survivability of space systems, while also shortening development timelines and reducing the barrier-to-entry for participation in the national security space industry. The program is predicated on the development of open interface standards-from the physical wireless link layer, through the network protocol stack, and including the real-time resource sharing middleware and cluster flight logic that can enable the emergence of a space global commons which would enhance the mutual security posture of all participants through interdependence. A key program goal is the industry-wide promulgation of these open interface standards for the sustainment and development of future fractionated systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,

AANA HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE FLIGHT TEST BRANCH AND THE ASTRONAUT OFFICE FOR 14 YEARS.  THEY BEGAN WITH THE CREATION OF PROTOTYPE DISPLAYS AND CONTROLS FOR THE CRV COCKPIT.  THIS WORK ALSO INCLUDED THE CREATION OF A REMOTE COCKPIT FOR THE X-38.

AS SUCH, THE CAT ENGINE IS AN ENABLING TECHNOLOGY THAT SUPPORTS NASA, COMMERCIAL, UNIVERSITY, AND MILITARY CUBESAT NEEDS FROM CONSTELLATION DEPLOYMENT TO LUNAR ORBIT INSERTION AND BEYOND. IN THE CAT ENGINE, A HIGH-POWER RF PLASMA DISCHARGE IS EXPANDED ADIABATICALLY ALONG A MAGNETIC NOZZLE TOPOLOGY ESTABLISHED BY PERMANENT MAGNETS. A RESULTANT AMBIPOLAR ELECTRIC FIELD ACCELERATES THE IONS TO HIGH ENERGIES TO GENERATE THRUST WHILE RETAINING HIGH PROPELLANT UTILIZATION. THE CAT ENGINE OFFERS A MEANS OF PROVIDING EFFICIENT AND HIGH THRUST-TO-POWER PRIMARY PROPULSION FOR CUBESATS AND MICROSATELLITES. THE CAT ENGINE PROMISES TO CHANGE THE CUBESAT PARADIGM FROM PASSIVE SENSOR CARRIERS TO FULLY CAPABLE MISSION-COMPLETING SPACECRAFT. SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION BY OUR TEAM WILL RESULT IN THE TRANSITION OF TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED INTO THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR BY A SMALL BUSINESS, THE ENGAGEMENT OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF THE SPACE SECTOR WORKFORCE, AND THE INFUSION OF AN ADVANCED IN-SPACE PROPULSION TECHNOLOGY FOR FUTURE NASA, COMMERCIAL, AND GOVERNMENT MISSIONS.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Rather than being an extension of the school day, these programs provide a safe place for students to develop skills and explore topics not covered in typical school curricula. There is significant interest from government agencies and community stakeholders in establishing and sustaining afterschool programming around the country. Increasing attention is being paid to teaching science in afterschool programs, asunder-privileged students who do not always have exposure or access to high-quality engagement in science often attend them. Such programs are a good vehicle to reach people who rarely participate in NASA education programs. Afterschool providers are looking for quality programming that has been designed for their unique setting, but there is an unfortunate deficiency in science content designed for out-of-school time. There is thus a tremendous opportunity for teaching astronomy in the afterschool setting, and most students and program leaders alike have an innate fascination with the cosmos. Afterschool Universe is a fun, hands-on afterschool astronomy program that introduces participants to a variety of basic concepts in astronomy. It is designed for middle school students, as research shows that middle school is a critical time in the development of attitudes about science and career options, especially in girls. This program was developed by the Astrophysics Science Division at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in 2006 and was pilot tested in 2006 and 2007. It has been disseminated nationally since early 2008 through two-day training workshops for program implementers. Over 300 afterschool program providers have been trained at these workshops, but the frequency and geographical reach of these trainings inherently limit the spread of the program. We propose to increase the efficacy and impact of the Afterschool Universe dissemination effort through a train-the-trainer method that taps into established organizations and networks that support afterschool programming. We will conduct an intensive three-day training workshop for selected staff from these organizations, then support attendees to conduct their own training workshops within their networks. This train-the-trainer method will permit a much more rapid dissemination of the program and provide a larger geographical reach than is currently possible. By training a small group of trainers, we can reach hundreds of implementers and thousands of students who would not otherwise learn much about astronomy. This is a fitting effort to build upon the excitement of the International Year of Astronomy in 2009, as it will provide both leader and student participants with continued exploration of the universe in the years that follow.",,,,,,,,,,,,

THIS PUMP WILL FULFILL SEVERAL NEEDS STATED IN SBIR RESEARCH TOPIC, H2.01: CRYOGENIC FLUID MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES. ZERO GRAVITY CRYOGENIC CONTROL DEVICES (SPRAY BARS AND MIXER), REQUIRE CRYOGENIC LIQUIDS TO BE PUMPED EFFICIENTLY. PROPELLANT CONDITIONING AND DENSIFICATION TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRE COMPACT, EFFICIENT PUMPS. BROAD AREA COOLING OF CRYOPROPELLANT SHIELDS CAN BE FACILITATED BY THE PUMPING OF A COLD GAS SUCH AS HELIUM IN A LOOP FROM A CRYOCOOLER TO A SHIELD. VARIOUS METHODS OF LIQUEFACTION OF OXYGEN SUCH AS PASSIVE RADIATIVE COOLING CAN BE ENABLED BY CRYOGENIC PUMPING. OTHER AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS SUCH AS A FUEL PUMP FOR LIQUID HYDROGEN FUELED AIRCRAFT. A COMPACT, RELIABLE, AND LIGHT WEIGHT PUMP FOR CRYOGENIC LIQUIDS CURRENTLY DOES NOT EXIST. OUR SUBCONTRACTOR, BALL AEROSPACE AND TECHNOLOGIES, HAS IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR SUCH A PUMP SEVERAL YEARS AGO, BUT HAS NOT FOUND A SUITABLE AVAILABLE PRODUCT. SCROLL PUMPS HAVE SEVERAL ADVANTAGES OVER OTHER PUMP TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING BEING COMPACT, LIGHT WEIGHT, RELIABLE AND EFFICIENT. THE PUMP CAN BE HERMETICALLY ISOLATED FROM THE DRIVE MOTOR BY THE USE OF A MAGNETIC COUPLER, ALLOWING THE PUMP TO BE HERMETICALLY SEALED. BECAUSE OF THE ORBITAL MOTION, THE SCROLLS CAN BE PLACED IN A METAL BELLOWS THAT ARE SEALED TO THE HOUSING WHICH ISOLATES THE LIQUID VIA A VACUUM ENCLOSURE FOR THERMAL ISOLATION. THE BEARINGS CAN BE PLACED ON THERMALLY ISOLATING ARMS, SO THEY DO NOT NEED TO OPERATE AT CRYOGENIC TEMPERATURES. SCROLL PUMPS HAVE CONSIDERABLE TECHNICAL HERITAGE RELEVANT TO THIS APPLICATION. AIR SQUARED HAS DEVELOPED AND SUCCESSFULLY TESTED SCROLL PUMPS FOR LIQUIDS AND FOR CRYOGENIC GASSES. AIR SQUARED HAS DEVELOPED SEVERAL COMPACT PUMPS FOR PUMPING AIR WHICH HAS SIMILAR VISCOSITY AND COMPRESSIBILITY TO LIQUID HYDROGEN.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the Flint River watershed, there has been an increase in the development and urbanization affecting the water quality, quantity, and its aquatic inhabitants. As the population continues to increase, there will be a shift in land use from forested and agricultural uses to more urban and residential uses. A variety of environmental and economic implications come as a result of this shift in land use. It is important to predict these future shifts in land use to both understand and reduce any negative impacts. The major goal of this research is to develop and utilize methodology in the form of descriptive and predictive models, which will facilitate the determination of factors driving LUCC (Land Use Cover Change) in the Flint River watershed. I will analyze historical and current satellite remotely sensed and aerial photography data to detect potential land-use pattern and develop a comprehensive digital GIS geodatabase for the study area. During normal- to low-flow periods, study sites within the Flint River Watershed will be assessed for stream flow measurements. Basic stream water quality measurements including pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids, alkalinity, hardness, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, and bacterial colony forming units will also be taken during periods of normal to high flow. We expect that basic stream water quality measurements will be poorer in stream reaches associated with increasing urbanization and devegetation. At NASA Centers the Earth's surface characteristics and their linkages to the atmosphere and hydrologic cycles are being analyzed and modeled using remotely sensed data. Measurements from satellite and aircraft sensors, in conjunction with in situ measurements, are used to study spatial and spectral resolution and temporal variability effects on determination of land surface energy fluxes, hydrometeorological characteristics, and biophysical components. These technologies used at NASA Centers are related to my proposed research and will help me throughout my findings.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Alaska is an ideal place on which to focus such exhibits. Surface temperatures in the Arctic are increasing at twice the global rate and Alaska residents are already feeling some of the impacts of climate change. Warming permafrost bas led to structural damage of homes and other buildings in parts of Alaska and retreating sea ice bas spurred coastal erosion. University of Alaska scientists are intensively studying these phenomena, and can provide data sets related to vegetation change, permafrost thaw, methane emissions, and chlorophyll production in northern oceans, sea ice dynamics, insect outbreaks, and models that forecast changes in climate and weather patterns, among others. Although many of these changes are being felt most intensely in the Arctic, they are occurring globally and are of broad interest to people across the United States and around the world. We will illustrate our changing Earth by displaying dynamic animations and a 7-minute movie about climate change in the Arctic on spherical display systems (e.g. .. Magic Planet) in our respective outreach institutions in . Using a portable Magic Planet, we will also present our exhibits and related programming to underserved communities in rural Alaska, including some Alaska Native villages already experiencing the impacts of climate change. Our spherical displays will simulate the view of Earth from space and dramatically highlight the interconnectedness of the Arctic with other parts of the planet. We will highlight downstream effects of climate change, as well, including shifts in plant and animal ranges and animal migration patterns, which will be superimposed on the globe. Associated high-definition, flat screens will allow viewers to zoom in on regions of interest and will feature interviews with scientists, Alaska Natives and others who have personal experience with climate change in their lifetimes. We will also include footage of fieldwork recently conducted in the Arctic. The project will extend its reach across the nation through dissemination of our programs throughout the informal science education community, many of whom already use the Magic Planet as an educational platform. Our proposal will clearly advance NASA's mission, strategic vision and the specific objectives of NASA's Office of Education by l)using exciting, experiential, bands-on exhibits to boost public awareness of NASA's mission and programs; 2)expanding STEM informal education opportunities throughout Alaska and among Alaskan visitors, thereby promoting American scientific and technological literacy; and 3)reaching out to Alaska Native communities that have been underserved and underrepresented in education and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This project will also be an important step in enhancing strategic partnerships between Alaska's STEM and NASA-related formal and informal education providers. ",,,,,,,,,,,,

THE TOOL WILL ENABLE ANALYSTS TO IDENTIFY, EARLY IN THE DESIGN PROCESS, POTENTIAL DESIGN, TASK ALLOCATION, OR MISSION PLANNING ISSUES THAT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT ASTRONAUT PERFORMANCE. THE PROPOSED TOOL, SPACEPRINT, WILL LEVERAGE A HUMAN PERFORMANCE MODELING ENVIRONMENT, THE IMPROVED PERFORMANCE RESEARCH INTEGRATION TOOL (IMPRINT), AND TAILOR IT TO SPACE MISSION APPLICATIONS. IMPRINT WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE ARMY RESEARCH LABORATORY, AND IS AVAILABLE, FREE OF CHARGE, TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. IMPRINT INCLUDES ALGORITHMS TO STUDY PERFORMANCE SHAPING FACTORS SUCH AS FATIGUE, TRAINING, AND USE OF PROTECTIVE CLOTHING WITH HUMAN PERFORMANCE MODELS THAT INCLUDE WORKLOAD. SPACEPRINT WILL BE BASED ON AN EXTENSIVE LITERATURE REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS, IN WHICH THE TEAM SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATES HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP RESEARCH AND LESSONS LEARNED TO IDENTIFY AND QUANTIFY FACTORS IN LONG-TERM SPACE MISSIONS THAT AFFECT ASTRONAUT WORKLOAD, FATIGUE, AND PERFORMANCE. THE RESULT OF THIS META-ANALYSIS WILL BE USED TO UPDATE IMPRINT ALGORITHMS SO THEY MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT SPACE-SPECIFIC CONDITIONS. THE TOOL WILL BE DEVELOPED SO IT CAN BE RUN IN A PREDICTIVE MODE, TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE IN MISSIONS THAT ARE BEING PLANNED, AND SO IT CAN RUN IN A LIVE MODE, USING REAL-TIME ASTRONAUT INPUTS ON WORKLOAD, FATIGUE, AND WELLNESS. THE LIVE MODE WILL ALLOW PLANNERS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AS MISSIONS ARE BEING PERFORMED, AND EVALUATE POTENTIAL MITIGATION STRATEGIES. THE TEAM WILL IDENTIFY SCENARIOS OF INTEREST, PERFORM TASK ANALYSES WITH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS (SMES), AND DEVELOP MODELS TO REFLECT THOSE SITUATIONS. SMES WILL REVIEW THE MODELS AND THEIR PREDICTIONS AN EARLY VALIDATION STUDY. THE TEAM WILL ALSO PERFORM AN EMPIRICAL, HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP VALIDATION STUDY. RESULTS OF THE VALIDATIONS WILL BE USED TO REFINE THE MODELS. OUR SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH EFFORTS WILL FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON SITUATIONS THAT RESULT IN WORKLOAD TRANSITIONS (E.G., AUTOMATION FAILURES, OTHER OFF-NOMINAL EVENTS), PLACING THE ASTRONAUTS IN POTENTIAL OVERLOAD SITUATIONS. THESE CONDITIONS, WHEN ADDRESSED BY FATIGUED ASTRONAUTS, CONSTITUTE WORST CASE SCENARIOS AND REQUIRE SPECIFIC, IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION. ONE PARTICULAR GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A PROTOTYPE TOOL THAT IS BOTH USABLE AND USEFUL FOR ANALYSTS, ALLOWING THEM TO EASILY MODIFY SCENARIOS AND EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT FACTORS ON MISSION PERFORMANCE. THIS TOOL WILL PROVIDE DATA ENTRY SCREENS THAT GUIDE THE USER THROUGH THE PROCESS OF BUILDING A SCENARIO. IT WILL ALLOW THE RESEARCHERS TO SPECIFY NUMEROUS RELEVANT FACTORS, E.G., OPERATORS, TASKS, EQUIPMENT, ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, AND SLEEP SCHEDULES. THE OUTPUT OF THE MODEL RUN WILL INCLUDE PARAMETERS OF INTEREST SUCH AS PERCEIVED WORKLOAD, FATIGUE, TIME TO INITIATE TASKS, TIME TO COMPLETE TASKS, TASK ACCURACY, TASK FAILURES (REPRESENTING HUMAN ERROR), RESULTS OF TASK FAILURES, AND OVERALL MISSION SUCCESS.",,,,,,,,,,,,

OF PARTICULAR INTEREST IS A HYBRID CARBON/SIC MATRIX COMPOSITE UTILIZING CARBON FIBER. THIS CLASS OF COMPOSITE, WHICH UTILIZES PHENOLIC PREPREG TO FORM THE INITIAL COMPOSITE STRUCTURE, LENDS ITSELF TO THE FABRICATION OF LARGE VERY COMPLEX STRUCTURES. TYPICALLY, THESE COMPOSITES ARE DENSIFIED VIA PIP PROCESSING. HOWEVER, THERE ARE DEFICIENCIES IN THIS MATERIAL SYSTEM. THE NATURE OF PIP PROCESSING RESULTS IN AN APPRECIABLE AMOUNT OF OPEN POROSITY, REQUIRING A CVD SIC EXTERNAL COATING FOR OXIDATION PROTECTION. THE APPLICATION OF CVD SIC TO LARGE STRUCTURES IS QUITE LIMITED DUE TO COST FACTORS. ALSO, SINCE THE COMPOSITES ARE FABRICATED USING 2D FABRIC, THE TRANSVERSE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES ARE TYPICALLY LOW. THIS PROPOSAL OFFERS A HIGHLY INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO ALLEVIATE THE ABOVE MENTIONED SHORTCOMINGS. FIRST, IT UTILIZES NANOTECHNOLOGY AT THE COMPOSITE MOLDING STAGE, ENABLING ENHANCED IN PLANE AND TRANSVERSE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES. SECONDLY, IT OFFERS A HIGHLY UNIQUE, NON CVD EXTERNAL COATING TECHNOLOGY.

THE FIRST STAGE HAS BEEN CHOSEN BECAUSE MANY CHALLENGES LIE IN ITS DESIGN. BOTH STAGES ARE ASSUMED TO BE SOLID ROCKET MOTORS WITH A PROPELLANT CAPABLE OF LOW TEMPERATURE STORAGE AND OPERATION. THE FIRST STAGE IS THE LARGER OF THE TWO MOTORS, MAKING GRAIN STRESSES MORE PRONOUNCED. IT ALSO UTILIZED THRUST VECTOR CONTROL (TVC), REQUIRING S TVC SYSTEM TO BE ADAPTED FOR THIS APPLICATION. THE SECOND STAGE GUIDANCE IS STILL BEING TRADED BETWEEN SPINNING AND TVC.  THERE IS A STRONG DESIRE TO USE LOW COST, HIGH HERITAGE COMPONENTS WHERE POSSIBLE. THE MAV MUST SURVIVE EARTH LAUNCH, CRUISE TRANSIT, ENTRY DESCENT AND LANDING AS WELL AS MARS SURFACE ENVIRONMENTS.  SEE THE ATTACHED ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (ERD) FOR DETAILED ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIFICATIONS. GENERAL: THE STRAWMAN MAV DESIGN ASSUMES THAT IT WILL BE LOWERED TO THE SURFACE OF MARS ON A HERITAGE, SKY-CRANE LANDER.  PROPELLANT MASS IS BASED ON A METASTUDY OF #tilde#20 YEARS OF SOLID PROPELLANT MAV DESIGNS. THE CURRENT MAXIMUM OUTER DIAMETER (NOT INCLUDING RCS OR CONNECTION ADAPTERS) IS ASSUMED TO BE 15 INCHES AND THE MAXIMUM STAGE 1 MOTOR LENGTH IS 0.9M. REDUCTIONS IN ENVELOPE ARE DESIRABLE AS THESE ARE PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES OF THE GEOMETRY. ALL MASSES HAVE ASSUMED A CURRENT BEST ESTIMATE PLUS 43% MARGIN. WHILE THIS CONTINGENCY MAY SEEM HIGH FOR A SOLID ROCKET MOTOR, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE SYSTEM DESIGN WILL REQUIRE ANY ADDITIONAL MARGIN PROVIDED BY THE PROPULSION SYSTEM.

In preparation for these projects the facility needs to determine the feasibility of accommodating large scale test articles, integration and facility operations/interactions, at conditions that are currently out of the facilities capabilities. The objectives of this task order are to resolve ground testing issues related to these large scale test articles using a blockage model and develop test capabilities required to meet program requirements.  In order to achieve the test capabilities the facility will require a new Mach 4 and Mach 6 nozzle. These new nozzles will be an interagral part of the 8-Ft HTT at NASA Langley Research Center.  The new nozzles will provide the existing facility expanded capability required to meet the testing goals of test programs present and future.  Large scale test articles pose issues with accurately determining blockage effects due to their complex shapes and the resulting complex flow interactions between the large scale test article and the facility.  A blockage model will help resolve most of these issues in preparation for ground testing large scale test articles.  The purpose of this task order is to obtain the designs, analysis, manufacturing schedules and estimates of long lead items for a new Mach 4 and new Mach 6 nozzles as well a trade study for a large scale blockage model. This task order is broken up into 3 main sections: Mach 4 nozzle (design & analysis), Mach 6 nozzle (design & analysis) and a blockage model (trade study).  Each have specific requirements and have specific due dates.   ",,,,,,,,,,,,

CURRENTLY, THE ONLY AVAILABLE MEASUREMENT OF ICP IS A POSTFLIGHT OPENING PRESSURE VIA LUMBAR PUNCTURE (LP). GIVEN THE INVASIVENESS OF LP AND THE RELUCTANCE TO UTILIZE IT IN THE ABSENCE OF CLINICAL INDICATIONS, ICP ELEVATIONS ARE YET TO BE CONSISTENTLY DOCUMENTED IN CREWMEMBERS. IN ADDITION, THE CAUSE FOR ICP ELEVATION IN-FLIGHT HAS NOT YET BEEN ESTABLISHED. CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS OF THE VIIP SYNDROME MAINLY FOCUS ON THE VASCULAR AND INTERSTITIAL COMPONENTS OF THE CEPHALAD FLUID REDISTRIBUTION. AN OVERLOOKED COMPONENT OF FLUID SHIFT THAT THIS STUDY WILL EVALUATED IS THE REDISTRIBUTION OF CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) IN THE CRANIOSPINAL SYSTEM AND ITS EFFECT ON ICP. AS THE CRANIUM CONTAINS MORE CSF THAN BLOOD, THIS COMPONENT OF FLUID SHIFT MAY BE A LARGER CONTRIBUTOR TO ICP ELEVATIONS THAN THE VASCULAR/INTERSTITIAL COMPONENTS. THE POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN SPINAL CANAL COMPLIANCE BUFFERING DUE TO SPINAL ELONGATION MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO ICP ELEVATIONS AS WELL.THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL UTILIZE SPECIALIZED MRI SEQUENCES, COLLECTED ON 7 SHORT-DURATION AND 10 LONG-DURATION CREWMEMBERS, TO ASSESS CSF HYDRODYNAMICS AND VASCULAR HEMODYNAMICS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO VIIP. KEY PARAMETERS THAT WILL BE ANALYZED INCLUDE TOTAL CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW, VENOUS DRAINAGE, INTRACRANIAL COMPLIANCE AND PRESSURE AS WELL AS CRANIO-SPINAL COMPLIANCE DISTRIBUTION. THESE VALUES WILL BE CORRELATED WITH CHANGES IN VISUAL/OCULAR FUNCTION AND MORPHOLOGY, AND MEASURES OF SPINAL ELONGATION. EFFECTS OF MISSION DURATION WILL BE ELUCIDATED BY COMPARING SHORT AND LONG-DURATION CREWMEMBERS. THESE ANALYSES WILL ELUCIDATE THE ROLE OF CEPHALAD CSF SHIFT IN THE ETIOLOGY OF VIIP, WILL DEFINE HYDRODYNAMIC MEASURES THAT MAY PREDICT SUSCEPTIBILITY TO VIIP, AND MAY LEAD TO IDENTIFICATION OF NOVEL COUNTERMEASURES.

PROPOSES TO DESIGN AND CHARACTERIZE A 24GSPS (GIGA-SAMPLES PER-SECOND), 6-BIT, LOWPOWER, AND LOW-COST ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL CONVERTER (ADC) FOR USE IN A WIDE RANGE OF NASA\'S MICROWAVE SENSOR BASED REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE AN ULTRA-HIGH-SPEED, LOW-POWER ADC THAT DOES BOTH, PROVIDES EXCELLENT INTERFACING CAPABILITIES TO TOP FPGAS AND ALSO HAS AN OPTIMIZED LOW-POWER SPECTROMETER DSP BACKEND AVAILABLE TO BE INTEGRATED ON THE SAME CHIP. THE PROPOSED ADC EMPLOYS AN INNOVATIVE TOPOLOGY WITH HIGH-BANDWIDTH FRONT-END SAMPLING CIRCUIT COMBINED WITH A FLASH-TYPE ADC AND ENCODER CIRCUITRY THAT SIMPLIFIES FPGA INTERFACING. INNOVATIVE AND EFFECTIVE DIGITAL CALIBRATION IS USED TO GUARANTEE SPURIOUS FREE NYQUIST FREQUENCY BAND WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT IN REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS. COMPARABLE COMMERCIAL ADCS ARE BASED ON EXPENSIVE AND POWER-HUNGRY BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS INDIUM PHOSPHIDE (INP), GALLIUM ARSENIDE (GAAS) AND SILICON GERMANIUM (SIGE). ALPHACORE DESIGNS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LATEST LOWPOWER, HIGH-SPEED DIGITAL CMOS PROCESSES, RESULTING IN ADC POWER CONSUMPTION THAT IS LESS THAN 1/8 OF THE POWER CONSUMPTION OF COMPETITOR ADCS. USING A CMOS PROCESS PROVIDES ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGES IN THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE EXISTING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) TO ENHANCE THE SYSTEM-LEVEL INTEGRATION OF THE ADC, E.G., ON-CHIP DIGITAL CALIBRATION LOGIC, DATA BUFFER MEMORY, HIGH-SPEED TRANSCEIVER LOGIC, AND DIRECT ON-CHIP DSP CAPABILITIES.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Co-eval clusters of stars with a range of masses are particularly useful for stellar modeling and evolution studies. They contain main sequence stars at higher masses enabling the study of these objects; they are chemically more homogeneous than field stars; and they allow one to test models of pre main-sequence and early stellar evolution without the complications inherent in modeling evolved objects of unknown age. The Trapezium itself is astrophysically interesting as it represents a very young population (few Myr) with some 0 and B members remaining, and several hundred variables having a range of masses and luminosities are already known to exist. We propose to perform photometry of stars in the Trapezium region of the Orion nebula. Our aims are to (1) update periods and quantify the aperiodic and quasiperiodic behavior of all stars in the field and (2) determine the types of variability for suspected or previously undetected variables with an eye toward the detection of pulsating variables; follow-up of known variables (e.g. Eaton, Herbst, and Hillenbrand 1995; AJ 110, 1735). We plan to search for variability in all stars with useful light curves. We will understake a comprehensive study of all variable objects in the field to provide the community with a modern survey of variability in the Trapezium, and giving us a potential new set of objects to help us understand these young stars. This cluster contains variables of several different types including T Tauri stars rotating spotted stars, and eclipsing binaries; it is possible that some of these stars may also have detectable pulsations. A study of all of these classes of variable will provide insight into the nature of these stars, and of young stars in general.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The program has actually been supported by NASA since 1980 in an initial grant and series of single year grant supplements. The program is advertised by the American Astronomical Society as the AAS Small Research Grants Program. A web page is available with details on how to apply and file final reports at http:Uwww.aas.org/grants/smrg.php. Twice each year, proposals are received and reviewed (the review used to take place at AAS meetings; it is now done by teleconference with materials distributed electronically to broaden the potential referee pool and economize). The goal of the program is to take some administrative burden from NASA for small, unsolicited proposals while generating the maximum scientific return. The proposals may cover the support of travel to observatories, computer costs, page charges, and other purposes related to individual research projects. The proposals are peer reviewed by an AAS committee and the AAS administers the award to the individual scientists. In past years, the AAS solicited proposals from individual astronomers for support of research ranging in amount from $300 to $5,000; in 1998 the average value of the 19 grants was just over $3,500. Subsequent years have similar averages. Although we received permission in 2000 to increase the maximum award to $7,000 from our program officer, we opted to wait until we received the 2004 grant before implementing this change. This cap now adequately meets the needs of all reasonable proposals and we plan to keep this cap in place for the duration of this grant. The program has been tremendously successful, with numerous papers published from results obtained with program funding. Additionally, the program funds research travel, research equipment costs (such as computers) and also supports innovative requests involving public outreach or community support (such as the production of the American Association of Variable Star Observers finder chart CDROM). More detailed information on the amount of grants awarded and some program highlights under the program from 2004 to 2008 are given below. Astronomers don''t just find employment at major universities or research institutions. They work at smaller colleges, in the private sector and even at community colleges. In this environment it is difficult to maintain a research presence, so necessary in all realms of physical science. One prerequisite for excellence in teaching-at all levels-is active participation in research. This experience enables the astronomer to contribute to and maintain current knowledge about the field. Many smaller or less-endowed schools do not have the means, ability or tradition for supporting faculty research. The American Astronomical Society has always and will continue to actively support research experience for all its members. In an era of constrained research support it is lmportant to foster a wide variety of research projects. Funding agencies are inundated with requests to sponsor all manner of projects, large and small. The large projects are the most economically feasible to process and manage by government agencies. Unfortunately, only limited resources are usually available for small grants, of a few thousand dollars and many government proposal review processes mix very small grants in with normal and large requests, disadvantaging the small requestors. Despite their small size, grants of this amount have a remarkable potential to produce excellent science, especially for those researchers at smaller institutions or who are just starting out. These requests often represent the work of the astronomer in a small facility or those in a larger institution who need a lower level of support. It is important to reach these scientists, who represent an important segment of the American astronomical community. The succ  ",,,,,,,,,,,,

THESE CHANGES ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE PLACE BECAUSE OF THE CONSTANT STATE OF TURNOVER THAT CHARACTERIZES SKELETAL MUSCLE, WHICH PERMITS MUSCLE TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN EXTERNAL LOADING BY INCREASING, DECREASING, OR MAINTAINING MUSCLE MASS.

The parts of the two-year project are:  Development of an online professional development handbook of NASA content for lead teachers to use in conducting workshops for peers and establishment of a national professional development network of lead teachers prepared to deliver workshops in NASA content for their peers in grades 6-12.  Incorporation of NASA science and technology content into AGI's middle and high school nationally distributed Earth science curricula. Promotion of Parts 1 and 2 of the program through  outreach programs such as Earth Science Week (ESW), Earth magazine, Earth Science World web site, the geoscientists comprising  membership and through  outreach efforts.  The anticipated results from this project are: 1. Increased use of NASA's geoscience, technology, engineering and mathematics content in secondary classrooms nationwide. This will result from three major efforts: a. Local workshops on NASA content conducted by a cadre of 100 lead teachers from across the U.S. (50 teachers each year over the two years of the project). These lead teachers, all of whom have already received extensive training and follow-up by  in both geoscience content and in conducting workshops, will receive both the materials and the training to conduct NASA workshops in their local school districts. b. Online professional development guide of NASA content and resources for the 100 lead teachers described in a. above to use in conducting their local workshops. Both , who will develop the guide, are extremely familiar with NASA's STEM education efforts. has worked with NASA as an Earth Science Week partner for many years and has promoted NASA's programs annually through the ESW kits, web site and press releases.  is among the nation's top centers of NASA research, having the lead role or a principal collaborating role in most of NASA's missions to Mars over the past two decades, and currently serving as lead institution for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera.  c. Nationally distributed secondary Earth science curricula that have been revised to include NASA geoscience content. These curricula, Investigating Earth Systems (IES) for middle school and EarthComm for high school, were originally developed by  with National Science Foundation support and commercially published in 2001/2002. They are undergoing revision over academic years 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 to update content, as well as to incorporate new investigations and technologies. Working with ASU SESE to incorporate NASA geoscience content into the revised curricula will ensure that this content will reach students and teachers throughout the U.S. NASA funding support is not requested for this revision effort. It is an in-kind contribution from the to support NASA's STEM education efforts.  2. Increased visibility for NASA's geoscience, technology, engineering and mathematics content in secondary classrooms nationwide.  This will occur through promotion of the training program and revised curricula through AGI's and ASU SESE's outreach efforts. ",,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, which is widely used to guide conservation policy and spending, does not explicitly incorporate climate change into its criteria to evaluate extinction risk. We aim to address this shortcoming by developing a modeling framework that links remote sensing of the environment with in situ biological data sets and global climate model predictions. We will couple habitat suitability models (including the Maximum Entropy method, Maxent) with metapopulation simulations (implemented in RAMAS software). These models will link remote sensing products (e.g., land cover classifications, NDVI, EVI, LAI, GPP, NPP, fPAR) with biodiversity data from natural history collections and biodiversity surveys, and future climate scenarios generated for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Our linked modeling approach will enable extinction risks under climate change to be assessed based on both landscape and demographic properties, therefore providing more reliable assessments, subject to fewer uncertainties, than when applying habitat suitability models alone. The principal objectives of the proposed project are to: 1) test the use of remote sensing products alongside in situ biological data and climate data for building habitat suitability models; 2) link habitat suitability models and metapopulation simulations to assess extinction risk under climate change; 3) investigate the impact that including versus excluding remotely sensed data has on assessments of extinction risk; 4) develop guidelines to ensure that remote sensing products are fully integrated into ongoing efforts to incorporate climate change within the IUCN Red List criteria. We will test our approach using the herpetofaunas of the United States (where in situ datasets are relatively abundant) and Madagascar (where data is much more limited) as case studies. Through collaboration with the IUCN, we will produce guidelines and software tools to advance the use of remote sensing products in environmental forecasting that influences policy and resource management. Our project will therefore expand and accelerate the realization of societal benefits from Earth system science.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Sub-micron mineral dust, still present in the fine-grained matrix of meteorites, coagulated and melted to form macroscopic clasts: once-molten Mg-silicate chondrules; the oldest solar system rocks, Ca-, Al-rich inclusions (CAIs); amoeboid-olivine-aggregates (AOAs). Different meteorite types (i.e., parent bodies) contain distinct abundances and sizes of chondrules and CAIs and their chemical and textural subtypes. We request support to measure the abundances, sizes, chemical compositions, and detailed crystallization histories of the objects (chondrules, CAIs, AOAs) that accreted together to form the most primitive meteorites. We will use this information in collaboration with astrophysical modelers to understand how these objects may have been formed and sorted into the different meteorite classes, and how that process bears on planet formation. Using previous support, we developed new techniques of 3D imaging, x-ray mapping and image analysis. We showed that existing abundance and size data collected long ago are not correct. We will address these questions with our measurements: What were the temperature, pressure, and volatile element distributions, local mixing and transport dynamics, and accretion chronologies during chondrite formation? Were high-temperature objects formed near the sun and transported outward? How did they mix in just the right proportions to yield different meteorite types, all with very similar overall chemical compositions? We also propose to use serial thin sectioning with a 30 micron wire saw to allow us to explore in unprecedented detail the crystallization histories and chemical, isotopic evolution during cooling of the oldest objects formed in the solar system: CAIs and AOAs. We will apply similar techniques, and 3D imaging, to find and explore layered chondrules that show evidence of repeated heating events in space before accretion. We will then apply state-of-the-art thermodynamic models to the chemical and isotopic data, in modeling how these objects formed in space. Finally, we will apply the same modeling tools to understanding the conditions of formation of minerals discovered in comet samples returned by the Stardust mission. These studies, together, bear directly on outstanding problems in cosmochemistry, at the interfaces between astrophysical theories, observations of far-away disks, and study of samples here on Earth.",,,,,,,,,,,,

WE WILL DEVELOP NEW CAPABILITIES USING OUR NEW LSM 710 CONFOCAL MICROSCOPE INSTALLED IN 2010. WE CAN SEE AEROGEL FLUORESCENCE IN BACKGROUND AEROGEL, AND REFLECTANCE FROM ALL SOLID GRAINS, ALL IN 34 CHANNELS OF IMAGE WAVELENGTHS. OUR GOALS INCLUDE USING OPTICAL METHODS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN COMETARY PARTICLES AND MELTED AEROGEL CAPTURE MEDIUM, AND COMBINING OUR RESULTS WITH SIMILAR IMAGING OF ANALOG TRACKS WITH KNOWN IMPACTORS, AND DEVELOPING MODELS OF HYPERVELOCITY IMPACTS IN AEROGEL. SUCH MODELS WILL ALLOW US TO INFER THE ORIGINAL POROSITY, MASS, AND VOLATILE CONTENT OF GRAINS FROM COMET 81P/WILD 2, CAPTURED IN AEROGEL TILES BY THE STARDUST MISSION. THESE ARE THE FIRST SOLID SAMPLES RETURNED TO EARTH FROM AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL BODY SINCE THE APOLLO ERA. LCSM ALLOWS RAPID 3D IMAGING OF COMPLETE COMET GRAIN TRACKS IN AEROGEL KEYSTONES AT #tilde#80 NM LATERAL SPATIAL RESOLUTION, AND #tilde#300 NM RESOLUTION ALONG THE OPTICAL AXIS, ALL ON A BENCH-TOP INSTRUMENT AT THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY. WE WILL DEVELOP COMPUTED 3D DECONVOLUTION METHOD FOR THE NEW LSM 710, ALREADY PERFECTED FOR THE OPTICS OF AN OLDER CONFOCAL MICROSCOPE (C. 1997). THIS IS NECESSARY TO CORRECT FOR MINOR DISTORTION OF REFLECTED LIGHT ALONG THE OPTICAL AXIS OF THE MICROSCOPE. OUR IMAGE ANALYSIS YIELDS HIGHLY ACCURATE 3D TRACK GEOMETRY, GRAIN SIZE AND GRAIN DISTRIBUTION. THE XRF ANALYSIS AT 1-5 MICRON/PIXEL TELLS US WHERE COMETARY GRAINS ARE, AND THE LOCATION OF POTENTIALLY HIGH-PRIORITY GRAINS. ALL THIS WORK CAN BE DONE PRIOR TO DESTRUCTIVE FLATTENING OF TRACKS, OR GRAIN REMOVAL. OUR IMAGING CAN BE DONE ON INTACT TRACKS EVEN AFTER REMOVAL OF LARGE TERMINAL PARTICLES. IMAGE DATA REMAIN ACCESSIBLE FOR FURTHER POST-PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS. THIS WORK IS FUNDAMENTAL TO NASA GOALS FOR MAXIMUM STARDUST DATA RETRIEVAL FOR UNDERSTANDING SOLAR SYSTEM ORIGINS. OUR GOAL IS TO IMAGE AS MANY TRACKS AS POSSIBLE AT USING LCSM, AND MAP GRAIN CHEMISTRY USING 2-D OR STEREO-PAIR XRF IMAGING. THIS SUITE OF 3D-DATA ADDS STATISTICAL POWER TO ANALYSES OF THE WHOLE SUITE OF DUST ENTRY PATHS, AND GRAIN FRAGMENTATION SYSTEMATICS. OUR COMBINED LCSM+XRF RESULTS WILL REVEAL LOCATIONS OF GRAINS WITH INTERESTING CHEMICAL COMPOSITIONS, PARTICULARLY SMALLER ONES IN TRACK BULBS.

THIS DISCOVERY OF AREAS RICH IN (MG,FE)-AL SPINEL ON THE RIMS AND CENTRAL PEAKS OF LUNAR IMPACT HAS REVIVED THE OLD PUZZLE OF THE ORIGIN OF LUNAR SPINEL. HOWEVER, THE ORIGIN AND MECHANISM(S) OF FORMATION OF SUCH SPINEL-RICH ROCKS ARE NOT CLEAR. IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTUAL SPINELRICH SAMPLES FROM THE MOON, VERIFICATION OF THE VALIDITY OF ANY HYPOTHESIS OF ORIGIN WILL REMAIN SPECULATIVE. TO DATE, ONLY ONE SPINELRICH MATERIAL HAS BEEN DESCRIBED IN A METEORITE SAMPLE (GROSS ET AL., 2011; GROSS AND TREIMAN, 2011). CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS CRITICAL TO ANALYZE THIS FRAGMENT AND ADDITIONAL SPINEL-BEARING ROCKS FROM THE LUNAR HIGHLAND CRUST, IN DETAIL BY PETROGRAPHY, MINERAL CHEMISTRY, LIQUIDUS/CRYSTALLIZATION EXPERIMENTS, AND SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE OF THE EXPERIMENTAL RUN PRODUCTS. SUCH ANALYSES WILL PROVIDE CONSTRAINTS ON THE PETROGENESIS OF SPINEL-RICH ROCKS ON THE MOON, AND OFFER VALUABLE INSIGHTS INTO SPINEL-RICH MATERIAL THAT WILL PROVIDE A MORE DIVERSE DATASET USABLE AS GROUND TRUTH BOTH FOR CALIBRATION AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SPINEL-RICH REFLECTANCE SPECTRA OBSERVED BY M3.

THEIR FORMATION REQUIRES RAPID HEATING TO TEMPERATURES OF AROUND 1800 K, FOLLOWED BY COOLING AT RATES OF AROUND 1000 K/HOUR, FAR SLOWER THAN THE FREE-SPACE COOLING TIME OF SUCH MILLIMETER-SIZED OBJECTS. IDENTIFYING THE MECHANISM FOR THIS UBIQUITOUS HEATING AND COOLING HAS REMAINED A PROBLEM FOR OVER A CENTURY. SIMILAR HIGH-TEMPERATURE MINERALS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN INTERPLANETARY DUST OF COMETARY ORIGIN, AND OBSERVED TRANSITIONS FROM AMORPHOUS TO CRYSTALLINE SILICATE SUGGEST HIGH-TEMPERATURE PROCESSING OF DUST IN OTHER PROTOPLANETARY DISKS. THE SHORT CIRCUIT INSTABILITY THAT WE HAVE RECENTLY DISCOVERED INTERMITTENTLY HEATS PROTOPLANETARY DISKS, PRODUCING THIN SHEETS HOT ENOUGH TO SATISFY THESE CONSTRAINTS. WE PROPOSE TO DETERMINE THE ROLE OF THIS INSTABILITY IN MINERAL FORMATION IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS. MELTING A LARGE FRACTION OF THE SOLIDS IN A PROTOPLANETARY DISK REQUIRES A SUBSTANTIAL SOURCE OF ENERGY. THE SHORT-CIRCUIT INSTABILITY CAN TAP THE HUGE RESERVOIR CONTAINED IN THE DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION OF THE DISK. PROTOPLANETARY DISKS MUST HAVE A VISCOSITY FAR EXCEEDING MOLECULAR VISCOSITY TO ACCRETE GAS AT THE RATES OBSERVED IN YOUNG STELLAR OBJECTS. THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE OF THIS VISCOSITY IS MAGNETIZED TURBULENCE DRIVEN BY THE MAGNETOROTATIONAL INSTABILITY (MRI) WHEREVER THE DISK IS ADEQUATELY IONIZED. MAGNETIZED TURBULENCE QUITE GENERALLY FORMS SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY INTERMITTENT CURRENT SHEETS THAT DISSIPATE THE MAGNETIC ENERGY AS HEAT. THESE CAN RAISE THE GAS TEMPERATURE LOCALLY WELL BEYOND ITS VOLUME AVERAGE.  IF TEMPERATURES REACH 1000 K, GAS RESISTIVITY STARTS TO FALL SHARPLY AS ALKALI METALS ARE THERMALLY IONIZED. OVER THE RANGE FROM 1000 K TO 2000 K, THE RESISTIVITY DECREASES BY MORE THAN 5 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. IN THAT TEMPERATURE RANGE, THE RESISTIVE EVOLUTION OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS DOMINATED BY THE SPATIAL VARIATION IN THE RESISTIVITY. SIMILARLY TO ELECTRICAL SHORT CIRCUITS AND LIGHTNING, THE ELECTRICAL CURRENTS IN THE DISK CONCENTRATE IN HOT, HIGH CONDUCTIVITY REGIONS, LEADING TO STRONG RESISTIVE HEATING IN NARROW SHEETS. WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THIS INSTABILITY CAN OCCUR IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS, EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF RADIATIVE COOLING. IN SOME CASES THE GAS IN OUR MODELS REACHES TEMPERATURES HIGH ENOUGH TO FORM CHONDRULES AND OTHER SIMILAR MINERALS.  WE PROPOSE TO FIND THE GAS AND GRAIN TEMPERATURES REACHED IN CURRENT SHEETS DRAWN DIRECTLY FROM MRI TURBULENCE. WE WILL USE LARGESCALE MODELS OF CURRENT SHEET FORMATION BY THE MRI TO SET THE STAGE FOR SMALL-SCALE MODELS OF INDIVIDUAL CURRENT SHEETS. THE MRI MODELS WILL USE THE PENCIL CODE TO CHARACTERIZE CURRENT SHEETS IN STRATIFIED, SHEARING-BOX SIMULATIONS WITHOUT TEMPERATURE DEPENDENT RESISTIVITY, AND IN HIGHER-RESOLUTION, UNSTRATIFIED SIMULATIONS WITH IT. TO IMPROVE OUR MODELING OF THE GAS RESISTIVITY AND THE MRI WE WILL USE A CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM CODE TO CALCULATE THE IONIZATION FRACTION IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS: THE ALKALI METALS CAN BE LOCKED AWAY IN SOLID MINERALS, PREVENTING THEIR THERMAL IONIZATION. TOGETHER THESE MODELS WILL PROVIDE THE INITIAL AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR SIMULATIONS OF INDIVIDUAL CURRENT SHEETS USING A PURPOSE-BUILT IMPLICIT CODE INCLUDING RADIATIVE TRANSFER AS WELL AS TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT RESISTIVITY. HISTORIES OF THE GAS TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE, AND THE AMBIENT RADIATION, SAMPLED USING LAGRANGIAN TRACER PARTICLES, WILL ALLOW US TO USE THE EQUILIBRIUM CONDENSATION CODE TO COMPARE THE EXPERIENCE OF SOLIDS IN OUR SIMULATIONS WITH EXPERIMENTAL CONSTRAINTS ON CHONDRULES AND OTHER HIGH-TEMPERATURE MINERALS. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS THAT THE SHORT CIRCUIT INSTABILITY CAN PRODUCE GRAIN THERMAL HISTORIES CONSISTENT WITH EXPERIMENTAL AND OBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE ENSEMBLE OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE MINERALS IN OUR OWN AND EXTERNAL DISKS.",,,,,,,,,,,,

FIRST, THE CONVENTIONAL PN PHOTODIODE DEVICE IS REPLACED WITH A NEW DEVICE STRUCTURE, THE NBN DETECTOR, WHICH INHERENTLY SUPPRESSES PERFORMANCE-LIMITING DARK CURRENTS, SUCH AS THOSE PRODUCED BY SURFACE LEAKAGE. SECOND, HIGHLY MANUFACTURABLE III-V MATERIALS ARE USED, WHICH ARE FURTHER ENHANCED WITH AMETHYST''S PROPRIETARY UV HYDROGENATION DEFECT MITIGATION PROCESS. THE RESULT IS A LOW COST, HIGH PERFORMANCE DETECTORS OPERATING IN THE 2   5 MICRON WAVELENGTH REGION. THERE IS A PRESSING NEED FOR ULTRA-HIGH SENSITIVITY DETECTORS OPERATING IN THIS REGION FOR THE DETECTION OF TRACE GASES AND CHEMICALS. IN PHASE I AMETHYST PRODUCED A 2.8 MICRON CUTOFF DETECTOR. THE PROGRAM MET ALL OBJECTIVES, DEMONSTRATING CONSIDERABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN PERFORMANCE OVER CONVENTIONAL PN DIODES USING THE NBN AND HYDROGENATION APPROACH. IN PHASE II, AMETHYST WILL DESIGN, FABRICATE AND TEST HIGH PERFORMANCE DETECTORS INDIVIDUALLY OPTIMIZED WITH CUTOFF WAVELENGTHS THROUGHOUT 2 5 MICRON WAVELENGTH RANGE.

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF RECENT MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION AND GEODETIC ACCURACY OF LUNAR TOPOGRAPHIC DATA AS A BASIS FOR CALCULATIONS TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE SELENOLOCATION OF THE M3 DATA. ROOT-MEAN-SQUARED (RMS) POSITIONAL ERRORS WILL BE REDUCED FROM #tilde#200 M RELATIVE AND 450 M ABSOLUTE TO ON THE ORDER OF A PIXEL (140 M) OR BETTER, AND THE NUMEROUS IMAGES WITH GROSS POSITIONAL ERRORS OF KILOMETERS WILL BE CORRECTED. SECONDARILY, SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC ACCURACY WILL BE IMPROVED THROUGH THE USE OF A MUCH MORE DETAILED TOPOGRAPHIC MODEL IN PHOTOMETRIC CORRECTIONS AND MORE ACCURATE REGISTRATION TO THIS MODEL. TWO DATASETS WILL BE USED: (1) DIGITAL DATA FROM THE M3 PDS ARCHIVE, INCLUDING HYPERSPECTRAL DATA FROM TWO MAJOR OPTICAL IMAGING PERIODS, ANCILLARY DATA INCLUDING SPICE KERNELS, SELENOLOCATION FILES, AND ENGINEERING DATA SUFFICIENT TO REPRODUCE AND IMPROVE UPON EARLIER RAY-TRACING RESULTS (BOARDMAN ET AL., 2011; GREEN ET AL., 2011); AND (2) THE FULL-RESOLUTION (#tilde#100 M/PIXEL) DIGITAL TERRAIN MODEL (DTM) DERIVED FROM STEREO IMAGING OF THE WIDE ANGLE CAMERA (WAC) INSTRUMENT ON THE LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (E.G., SCHOLTEN ET AL., 2011). THE WORK CONSISTS OF FIVE MAJOR TASKS: (1) SYSTEMATIC REPROCESSING OF THE FULL DATASET THROUGH THE MISSION-DEVELOPED LEVEL 1B PROCESSING PIPELINE USING THE WAC DTM TO GREATLY IMPROVE SELENOLOCATION ACCURACY; (2) DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE TOOLS FOR PROCESSING M3 DATA ''MOST IMPORTANTLY, A PHYSICALLY RIGOROUS CAMERA MODEL'' IN THE USGS ISIS3; (3) USE OF THE ADVANCED CAPABILITIES OF ISIS TO CONTROL THE GLOBAL M3 DATASET WITH IMPROVED ACCURACY AND GENERATE FURTHER IMPROVED LEVEL 1B PRODUCTS; (4) SYSTEMATIC REPROCESSING OF BEST VERSION OF LEVEL 1B DATA THROUGH THE MISSION DEVELOPED LEVEL 2 PROCESSING PIPELINE USING THE WAC DTM TO GREATLY IMPROVE PHOTOMETRIC ACCURACY; (5) GENERATION OF A COMPLETE SET OF ORTHORECTIFIED AND MOSAICKED (LEVEL 3) DATA PRODUCTS INCLUDING PHOTOMETRICALLY NORMALIZED SPECTRA AND SPECTRAL PARAMETER MAPS; AND (6) DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS, WITH INTERIM RESULTS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE ONLINE AND FINAL SPICE KERNELS, LEVEL 1B AND LEVEL 3 PRODUCTS FORMALLY ARCHIVED TO THE IMAGING NODE OF THE PLANETARY DATA SYSTEM (PDS). THE MULTIPLE PRODUCTS GENERATED BY THIS EFFORT WILL SERVE THE BROADEST POSSIBLE SET OF SCIENTIFIC APPLICATIONS OF THE M3 DATASET. LEVEL 1B PRODUCTS, WHICH ARE NOT SPATIALLY RESAMPLED, ARE ESSENTIAL OR STUDIES REQUIRING THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE SPECTRAL FIDELITY, AND THE IMPROVED SELENOLOCATION ACCURACY OF OUR RESULTS WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PHOTOMETRIC NORMALIZATION OF THESE DATA AND FACILITATE COMPARISON WITH OTHER DATASETS. THE RESAMPLED LEVEL 3 PRODUCTS WILL GREATLY SIMPLIFY THE USE OF M3 FOR REGIONAL STUDIES IN WHICH SUMMARY SPECTRAL CHARACTERISTICS SUFFICE. FINALLY, THE COMBINATION OF A FULL SET OF ISIS TOOLS PLUS IMPROVED SPICE DATA WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR USERS WHOSE SPECIAL NEEDS ARE NOT MET BY EITHER OF THESE PRODUCT SETS TO DO THEIR OWN M3 PROCESSING.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Many NASA Space and Earth programs in the infrared range 1060 a?? 1550 nm are limited by the detector performance that require long exposure time due to their low sensitivity and/or high noise. Large format infrared photon counting arrays with ranging capability would provide a valuable tool to many space missions. Current state-of-the-art fabrication of photon counting infrared detector arrays on non-silicon semiconductors is not mature enough to monolithically integrate complex readout circuitry at pixel level and large format array multiplexing. APEAK will develop novel, fast readout, integrated circuits (ROIC) to be integrated with large photon-counting infrared detector arrays into 3D imaging cameras with photon-counting sensitivity. These new cameras will support NASA missions in applications such as space docking, landing, remote mapping, and robotic vision. The goal of this project is to develop smart-pixel ROIC arrays in silicon with enhanced radiation tolerance and ready for hybrid integration with large infrared photon-counting avalanche photodiode arrays that will enable large-area detectors with short integration time, sub-nanosecond timing resolution, and on-pixel logic. The simulation, implementation and validation of all the blocks of a ROIC array specifically developed for operation with infrared photon-counting arrays In Phase II, APEAK will improve, fabricate and qualify ROIC arrays with integrated timing functions at pixel level and capable of integration in flip-chip technology with large infrared photon counting detector arrays. The potential NASA commercial applications are the following: free space optical communications, LADAR, LIDAR, planetary mapping, obstacle detection, 3D remote robotics, and docking. There are also potential non-NASA commercial applications. ROIC arrays could enhance the performance of hyperspectral imaging in medical and defense applications when interconnected to a large format detector arrays covering different spectral ranges. Specific biomedical applications include positron emission tomography (PET), laser correlation spectroscopy (LCS), single molecule detection and fast DNA sequencing. Military and security applications would include generic 3D imaging, hyperspectral imaging, laser ranging, night vision, surveillance, anti-collision devices, underwater imaging, and cargo imaging. In High-Energy and Nuclear Physics, these ROIC arrays could be used for high-resolution tracking and experiments using time-of-flight methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the importance of intraspecific genetic diversity to ecosystem functioning is poorly understood. Recent work demonstrates that genetic diversity within a foundation forest species, Populus tremuloides, can have large influences on ecological processes, especially carbon and nitrogen cycling. We propose to use remote sensing to measure the genetic diversity of P. tremuloides forests across multiple ecoregions. Our goal is to combine remotely sensed data with ground-truthed genetic and soil microbial data to better understand the patterns and consequences of forest genetic diversity across natural landscapes. Trembling aspen (P. tremuloides) is a dominant, early successional species that plays major ecological and economic roles in forests throughout western and north-temperate North America. We will combine Landsat and hyperspectral data with genetic, chemical, and microbial data to build predictive models of fundamental ecological processes. Our overall goal is to quantify forest intraspecific genetic diversity, and associated belowground microbial diversity and function, using remotely sensed data. Declining biodiversity is among the most important environmental issues facing society. Despite decades of research, the large-scale patterns and consequences of forest genetic diversity are unknown. Our current knowledge gaps are due, in large part, to the technical difficulties inherent in sampling large spatial areas for fine-scale information (e.g., plant genotype). We propose to bridge this gap in trembling aspen forests, a dominant, ecologically and economically important ecosystem, using a combination of remotely-sensed and ground-truthed data.",,,,,,,,,,,,

HOWEVER, ROUGHLY HALF OF THE CO2 PRODUCED FROM THESE EMISSIONS HAS BEEN REMOVED BY TERRESTRIAL AND OCEAN SINKS.

RATIOS OF THESE ISOTOPES ARE THE MAIN TOOL IN PALEOCLIMATOLOGY STUDIES ON EARTH. A PROPOSED NON-CONTACT OPTICAL INSTRUMENT SIMILAR TO CHEMCAM WILL BE CAPABLE OFMEASURING NOT ONLY COMPLETE ELEMENTAL COMPOSITIONS BUT ALSO THE KEY ISOTOPIC ABUNDANCES IN SURFACE MATERIALS. WE DEMONSTRATED THE RESOLUTION AND SENSITIVITY REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THESE ISOTOPES IN SYNTHETIC SAMPLES AND NATURAL MINERALS RELEVANT TO MARS. WE ARE UTILIZING AND DEVELOPING OUR RECENTLY PUBLISHED TECHNOLOGY: LASER ABLATION MOLECULAR ISOTOPIC SPECTROMETRY (LAMIS). OUR CONCEPT IS SIMPLE AND SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN. WE WILL ADVANCE TO TRL4 WITH THE FURTHER AIM OF INTEGRATING OUR LAMIS DETECTOR WITH A CHEMCAM-LIKE INSTRUMENT. THE PROPOSED EFFORT LEVERAGES AND ADVANCES THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED FOR CHEMCAM. THE ADDED STRENGTH OF MEASURING ISOTOPES WILL GREATLY EXPAND THECAPABILITIES OF THE CHEMCAM, WHICH IS ALREADY A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL INSTRUMENT ONBOARD \CURIOSITY\"". WE WILL DEVELOP A BREADBOARD PROTOTYPE OF THE INSTRUMENT THAT CAN BE LATER AMENDED TO MEASURE OTHER KEY ISOTOPES (C, N, B, CL, MG, CA, SR). WE PLAN FURTHER INFUSION IN NASA MISSIONS AND COMMERCIALIZATION. THE IMMEDIATE FOCUS IS ON MARS BUT OUR CONCEPT IS ALSO HIGHLY GERMANE TO FUTURE LANDING MISSIONS TOTHE MOON, OTHER PLANETS AND THEIR MOONS, ASTEROIDS, AND TO A BROAD RANGE OF APPLICATIONS IN ECOLOGY, AGRONOMY, NUCLEAR INDUSTRY, RADIO-CHEMOTHERAPY, FORENSICS, SECURITY AND OTHER FIELDS. OUR INSTRUMENT CAN BE USED FOR STAND-ALONE LANDING MISSIONS OR FOR IN SITU SAMPLE CHARACTERIZATION PRIOR TO SAMPLE RETURN.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

ADDITIONALLY, LOW-TEMPERATURE MOTORS LIKE THE MAV ARE OFTEN TESTED AT ROOM TEMPERATURE, SINCE TESTING AT TEMPERATURES OF -40 DEG C OR LOWER IS BOTH DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE. SINCE TESTING AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES RESULTS IN HIGHER BURN RATES FOR TYPICAL PROPELLANTS, AND THUS HIGHER WORKING PRESSURES, AMBIENT TESTS RESULT IN A MOTOR CASE THAT IS HEAVIER THAN REQUIRED FOR A LOW TEMPERATURE MISSION, BECAUSE AMBIENT TESTING RESULTS IN A HIGHER MAXIMUM EXPECTED OPERATING PRESSURE. OUR PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY ALLEVIATES THAT PROBLEM BY USING A PLATEAU-BURNING COMPOSITE PROPELLANT THAT WILL SUBSTANTIALLY LESSEN THE BURN RATE SENSITIVITY TO TEMPERATURE. AS SUCH, THE MAV OPERATING PRESSURE IN AMBIENT CONDITIONS WILL MORE CLOSELY RESEMBLE THOSE ON THE MARS SURFACE, ALLOWING FOR A LIGHTER MOTOR CASE RESULTING IN REDUCED WEIGHT, SMALLER VOLUME AND GREATER PROPELLANT MASS FRACTIONS.

Understanding the extent of these processes may offer insights into how abiotic organic compounds, sometimes identical to biomolecules, formed and/or survived in planetary environments.

To date, these ee seem limited to the chiral 2-methyl-2-amino acids, however, it is possible that they were also present in 2-H-2-amino acids but were lost to racemization during aqueous reactions. Because racemization, the reversal and equilibration between L- and D-configurations in water, affects especially amino acids having a hydrogen attached to the second carbon, the possibility would seem hard to prove. However, acids having two chiral centers instead of one may still be able to reveal prior ee for 2-H compounds in meteorites, in spite of water exposure and racemization. Their study, would offer unique opportunities to estimate the extent of molecular asymmetry in the solar nebula upon formation of meteorite parent bodies and the physico-chemical conditions of those planetesimal aqueous processes. We propose to perform chiral analyses of Murchison and Murray diasteromeric amino and monocarboxylic acids, which are known but were never analyzed for this purpose, employing methodologies we have used previously with success. The proposed studies seek an understanding of chemical processes in the early solar system that fostered the evolution of abiotic organic molecules and of the traits they share with biomolecules. As such, they are directly relevant to the objectives of this NRA.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Although chemical enrichment has been coarsely simulated on cosmological scales - no one has captured the abundance inhomogeneities that arise in real stellar populations. Instead - studies on stellar scales have focused on star formation: targeting H2 and HD chemistry in primordial clusters and magnetohydrodynamic and radiative processes in present-day clusters. We will carry out numerical simulations that model in unparalleled detail the chemical changes that occur after stars form and enrich their surroundings. Our approach will start from the point of star formation and diligently model the subsequent production / dissemination / and accretion of 92 chemical elements: from H / He / and Li to tracers of the r and s-processes. Our efforts will focus on the ten-thousand to one million solar mass scales on which molecular clouds - the primary units of star-forming gas - are converted into open clusters - the primary units of formed stars. These clusters play a pivotal role in chemical evolution and are constrained by as wealth of observations: studies of metal-poor Galactic halo stars have found a number of unusual abundance trends - which provide important clues to the earliest epochs of enrichment; spectroscopic studies of nearby clusters have uncovered substantial inhomogeneities that result in a significant intracluster abundance scatter between stars; and self-enrichment is expected to strongly affect which stellar systems are most likely to host habitable planets. Quantifying these processes with our simulations will directly impact a wide range of future NASA missions including the James Webb Space Telescope / Kepler / and the New Worlds Observer as well as impact our interpretation of ongoing ground-based observations. Most importantly - our work will contribute to answering the more fundamental questions: what is the universe and from what is it made?,,,,,,,,,,,,

This issue is especially important given reports that the crew's immune system is dysfunctional during flight, and our recent discovery that spaceflight increased the disease-causing potential and globally altered the gene expression of the human food-borne pathogen Salmonella typhimurium. Our research also showed that many of the observed changes in Salmonella were, associated with specific proteins in the cells, called RNA binding proteins, that bind to and regulate genetic material within the cell to control cellular characteristics in response to stress. In addition, our studies during spaceflight and using ground-based, spaceflight analogue culture systems have shown that increasing the concentration of certain ionic salts, like phosphates, in the growth media can prevent the increased disease causing potential observed for Salmonella during spaceflight. Interestingly, human cells also contain evolutionarily conserved RNA binding proteins that are very similar in structure and function to those found in bacteria. In human cells, these RNA binding proteins are critical for the cells proper function, including supporting a healthy immune system, maintaining tissue differentiation, and responding to cellular stress. We hypothesize that RNA binding regulatory proteins and their small RNA binding counterparts are key to a conserved, common cellular spaceflight response mechanism in both bacterial and human cells and that this response can be manipulated by environmental salt/ion levels. The implications of a universally conserved molecular response to spaceflight would affect NASA's approach to infectious disease risk assessment, development of biological processing systems for exploration, and changes in biodegradation during a mission. Indeed, if these responses are also observed in human cells, they may translate into knowledge of both the astronaut's response to infection and possibly larger physiological responses that are influenced by cellular changes.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous work by the PI (Desch&Connolly 2002) and his team, including studies funded a previous Origins of Solar Systems grant (Morris et al 2009a,b), have helped establish the viability of passage through shock waves in the solar nebula gas as the model for chondrule formation. We now turn our attention to using models of chondrule formation to constrain the physical conditions in the solar nebula, especially chondrule densities and clumpiness and the sizes and sources of the shocks. Doing so will require a refinement of current shock codes, expanding them to 2 dimensions (cylindrical geometry), to account for variations in chondrule density parallel to the shock front, and to model parabolic bow shocks associated with eccentric planetesimals. We propose to take the Perseus code written by the PI and his research team (Ouellette et al. 2007) to study supernova-driven bow shocks around protoplanetary disks and adapt it to the problem of chondrule formation. The critical modification will be the addition of modules to calculate the radiation field in cylindrical geometry. We describe details of how this and other changes will be achieved. We will apply this modified code to test 3 ideas about chondrule formation by shocks. 1.) Desch&Connolly (2002) hypothesized a correlation between compound chondrules and barred olivine textures because chondrules in clumps experience higher peak temperatures and faster cooling rates. But shock models assume uniform densities on scales of 10^5 km larger than the likely sizes of clumps,<10^3 km, and this idea is not fully tested. 2.) Recent measurements of primary Na in olivine phenocrysts by Alexander et al. (2008) led them to conclude chondrule melts were in equilibrium with high partial pressures of Na, due to partial evaporation of chondrules in exceptionally dense clumps. We instead hypothesize that high vapor pressures result from total evaporation of chondrules in dense clumps, with chondrules melted normally, in nearby regions of lower chondrule density being focused by shocks into the dense, vapor-rich regions. Our code will quantify and test this effect. 3.) Gravitational instabilities are one proposed source of shocks, but bow shocks driven by eccentric planetesimals are a very likely alternative. Proponents of the bow shock model hypothesize that chondrule cooling rates would match observational constraints, but this is untested. Our modified code, which will test the above hypotheses, is highly relevant to NASA's Strategic Goals and Research Objectives, especially subgoals 3C and 3D, and to the goals of the Origins of Solar Systems program. The key to understanding the origin of our solar system is to put chondrule formation in its proper context.",,,,,,,,,,,,

IT IS UNCLEAR HOW OR IF THESE CHANGES ARE EQUALLY MANIFESTED IN THE NORTHERN LEVANT (ROUGHLY LEBANON AND SYRIA), OR IF THE COLLAPSE OF THE LEVANT''S FIRST URBAN SETTLEMENT SYSTEM WAS THE RESULT OF ENVIRONMENTAL OR SOCIAL FACTORS. THE EXTENT TO WHICH RECENT DEVELOPMENT HAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED DIMINISHING ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES IN THE REGION IS EQUALLY UNKNOWN, BUT IMPACTS THE ABILITY TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PAST SINCE DAMAGED SITES YIELD FAR LESS VIABLE INFORMATION. A LARGE BODY OF ACCURATE, REGIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE DATA FROM THE NORTHERN LEVANT IS NEEDED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, BUT THIS REGION HAS BEEN LARGELY CUT OFF FROM ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH FOR MORE THAN A GENERATION BECAUSE OF WARS AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS. TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS, THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS FUNDING TO SUPPORT ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE PROSPECTING AND CONDITION ASSESSMENT WITH TWO METHODS THAT UTILIZE LANDSAT TM, ASTER AND CORONA IMAGERY FROM LEBANON AND SOUTHWESTERN SYRIA. THE CAUSES OF THE EBA COLLAPSE WILL BE ASSESSED THROUGH STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF SETTLEMENT PATTERN DATA DERIVED FROM REMOTELY SENSED DATA, COMPARED TO THE MUCH BETTER-KNOWN SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS IN THE SOUTHERN LEVANT. IF CLIMATE CHANGE IS A FACTOR IN THE EBA COLLAPSE, CHANGES IN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN SETTLEMENT TRAJECTORIES SHOULD BE SIMILAR ACROSS THE EARLY-MIDDLE BRONZE AGE TRANSITION. THERE SHOULD BE EXPANSIVE EVIDENCE OF SETTLEMENT PATTERN CHANGES IN THE LEVANT (E.G., ABANDONMENT, SITE SIZE DECREASES, ETC.). THE PROJECT WILL USE SUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION AND OTHER IMAGE ANALYSIS SOFTWARE TO FIND ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES FROM SPACE AND COMPUTE PRECISE SITE LOCATION AND AREA DIMENSIONS. SITE POLYGON CENTROIDS WILL BE USED TO PERFORM A NEAREST-NEIGHBOR ANALYSIS TO MATCH REMOTELY-SENSED SITES TO PUBLISHED SITE NAMES, CORRECT THEIR POINT COORDINATES, AND RECORD SITE SIZES, USING A PUBLISHED INVENTORY WHOSE SITE LOCATIONS WERE RECORDED ONLY TO THE NEAREST KILOMETER. COLLECTED OVER A PERIOD OF ABOUT THIRTY YEARS, SATELLITE IMAGERY CAN DOCUMENT CHANGES IN LAND COVER AND DEVELOPMENT ON ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES. MODERN SITE DAMAGE WILL BE ASSESSED BY COMPARING THE DEVELOPMENT ON SITES FROM CORONA IMAGES OF THE LATE 1960S-EARLY 1970S TO MORE RECENT IMAGERY, THUS QUANTIFYING ASPECTS OF LAND COVER CHANGE RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT ON ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES. BY ACCOMPLISHING THESE GOALS, THE PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF HUMAN ACTIVITY ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND VICE-VERSA OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME, HELP QUANTIFY GLOBAL LAND CHANGE SINCE THE EBA IN THE NORTHERN LEVANT, AND FURTHER DOCUMENT LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF HUMAN/ENVIRONMENTAL INTERACTION IN DETERIORATING CLIMATE CONDITIONS.

We hypothesize tbat the combination of a spacefligbt-induced increase in virulence of the pathogen coupled with a blunted immune response of the host will result in a synergistic effect on tbe host-pathogen interactions such that the risk of infectious disease during spaceflight is exacerbated.

The proposed investigation also includes funding for a graduate student to help train the next generation of planetary scientists, as encouraged by the Dawn Science Team. More specifically, the proposed science investigation would include: (Task 1) Identify, characterize, and map any and all volcanic and plutonic features on the surface of Vesta, determine their contact (stratigraphic) relationships with each other and surrounding materials, determine the diversity of the deposits and their source vents (if possible), map their areal extents, and determine their relative ages using superposition relationships and crater counts. Working with Dawn Co-Is we would also identify candidate volcanic features for determining their absolute (cratering model) ages using well-established crater statistical methods. We expect to identify geologic features such as (e.g., impact craters, dikes, sills, lava flows, calderas, lava lakes, shields, domes, cones, layering in the walls of craters exposing lava flows and intrusions, contact boundaries between flow units, potential pyroclastic deposits). However, in the unlikely event that no volcanic or plutonic materials are found on Vesta, we will use the methods discussed above to identify, characterize, and map all other geologic features produced by other processes; (Task 2) Test the predictions of Wilson and Keil (1996, 1997) on the types and dimensions of predicted igneous deposits on Vesta. This would be done by comparing any identified Igneous features to their predictions for lava flow dimensions and the depths of intrusions, as well as by searching for any evidence of explosive pyroclastic deposits (they predict none should occur on Vesta). Additionally, if warranted, we can revisit the mathematical models of Wilson and Keil (1996,1997) with ''in situ'' measurements from FC images (i.e., actual flow dimensions, extents of any pyroclastic material), to investigate any similarities or differences in Vesta's volcanic deposits with their previous model predictions, which will inform about the volumes and rheologies of Vesta's magma compositions and volatile inventory. We would accomplish these objectives through analysis of Framing Camera Images, including use of stereo images (where available) and shadow measurements for depth. We would make geologic maps of interesting and complex areas as tools to further aid the image analysis. Any maps produced would be published in peer-reviewed journals as part of our anticipated papers that would discuss our results and new insights into geologic processes and features found on Vesta. This work would enhance our understanding of the geologic history of this differentiated asteroid, and of the nature and diversity of planetary volcanism in the Solar System, particularly how volcanism operated on a small body. Consequently, this research is directly relevant to NASA's goals for understanding the genesis and evolution of Solar System bodies, and the Dawn science objectives of understanding the origin and evolution of this unique asteroid.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In light of the uniqueness and clear prebiotic implications of these findings, studies are proposed towards gaining a fuller understanding of CR2 chiral and molecular composition as well as assessing prebiotically realistic pathways of early Earth evolution for selected amino acids of meteoritic distribution. Extend the search for possible enantiomeric excesses to CR2 hydroxy- and monocarboxylic acids that, like amino acids, might have formed from aldehyde precursors. Search CR2 extracts for N-containing compounds of prebiotic significance (HCN, formamide, urea, peptides) that have not yet been identified but could be abundant in these meteorites. Assess the possible formation of small peptides from standard amino acid pools of CR2 and CR2/CM2 mixed composition under prebiotic settings. Continue the study of the chiral interactions between sugars and amino acids in a water-based prebiotic model. Methodologies developed through the years in our laboratory will allow a ready chiral investigation of hydoxy-, monocarboxylic acids. Methodologies for the analyses of other compounds and model experiments will be developed, following literature and preliminary experimental findings. These studies will broaden our understanding of cosmochemical samples with unique prebiotic potential, address anew the basic exobiological question of whether extraterrestrial organic compounds contributed to terrestrial molecular evolution and will provide relevant data on how this evolution might have proceeded upon delivery to the early Earth of organic materials with CR or CR/CM mixed-compositions.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The quantification of history"" requires precise and accurate dating of impact events. Noble gas geochronology of melted or shocked target rocks is historically one of the most successful approaches to dating impacts, but the most advanced techniques developed since the Apollo era for terrestrial Ar and He geochronology are not commonly applied to extraterrestrial samples. For example, state-of-the-art 40Ar/39Ar geochronology of frictional melts associated with major fault zones (pseudotachylites) typically employs the extremely high spatial resolution of ultraviolet (UV) laser microprobes to selectively ablate and analyze glassy or recrystallized domains in polished petrographic thin sections while avoiding contamination by older xenolithic or xenocrystic materials. Since many of the scientific challenges involved in geochronologic studies of impact melts are identical to those involved in geochronologic studies of impact melts, we propose to evaluate the utility of 40Ar/39Ar UV laser microprobe dating of lunar impact melts through two studies. The first involves using this technique to date materials from the Mistastin Lake Impact Crater, northern Labrador. Target rocks of the ca. 36 Ma Mistastin Lake impact are intermediate to mafic igneous rocks (primarily anorthosites, hypersthene monzonites, and granodiorites), such that studies in and around this crater provide a unique opportunity to study impact melts and breccias that are among the best lithologic analogues on Earth for samples that may be encountered in future explorations of impact sites on the Moon (such as South Pole-Aitken). More importantly for our purposes, the Mistastin Lake impactites are simple by comparison to lunar impactites, which record a complex history of multiple impact events. In the more ambitious second study, we will move on to the more difficult problem of dating polyphase Apollo 17 impact breccias by 40Ar/39Ar UV laser microprobe, with an eye toward comparing the results to previous impact chronologies developed through conventional 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb ion microprobe work by other research teams and hopefully expanding our knowledge of the impact record in the Taurus-Littrow valley. In this way, we will determine whether or not the higher spatial resolution of UV laser microprobe studies add extra value to impact chronology studies beyond that provided by more conventional techniques. Finally, our last study represents the first reconnaissance application of the (U-Th)/He UV laser microprobe in impact chronology studies. Recently, applications of conventional (U-Th)/He zircon and apatite dating techniques have provided important constraints on the ages of some major terrestrial impact structures, but similar studies on lunar samples will likely necessitate the use of more advanced, laser ablation techniques that permit analyses of very small samples. The (U-Th)/He UV laser microprobe is a perfect tool for such studies, but it has not been tested on terrestrial or extraterrestrial impactites. We intend to explore the utility of this technique by applying it to zircons and phosphates from the Mistastin and Apollo 17 impactites. """,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, we propose to perform the following three tasks: 1) Determine the thermal conductivity of complex materials (i.e. layered, cemented samples, and grain mixtures) observed on Mars using laboratory measurements under realistic temperature and pressure conditions, and a numeric model of heat conduction. 2) Develop an improved numerical model of heat transfer for the Martian subsurface based on model that incorporates the thermal conductivity of complex materials and parameterize the outputs. We will develop a web-based interface for this model to allow remote users to easily calculate Martian surface temperatures under current and past conditions. 3) Validate the laboratory work and numerical modeling using Martian surface temperature measurements of cemented, layered and mixtures of grain sizes performed by the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES) onboard MER-A and MER-B in conjunction with the Microscope Imager (MI) data of the same soils. This work will lead to a better understanding of the thermophysical behavior of complex planetary materials under realistic conditions of gas pressure and temperature. These results will significantly improve the characterization of the physical nature and geological processes shaping the Martian surface. Measurements from the Mars Odyssey Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS), the MGS Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES), and the Mars Rover Mini-TES instruments have provided a vast inventory of temperature measurements of the Martian surface at spatial scales from centimeters to kilometers. These data, in conjunction with the laboratory measurements and improved thermal models that will be developed in this work, will lead to a significantly improved characterization of the Martian surface materials, which will in turn lead to a better understanding of Martian aqueous, aeolian, volcanic, and impact processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose to link cutting-edge, Web-based Virtual Field Trips (VFTs) with lendable Experience Boxes"" containing activity plans, resources and, most significantly, objects to create unique education resources for elementary-, secondary- and informal educators. We will also create digital versions of the Experience Boxes containing virtual objects to maximize the reach of the VFT-Experience Box resources. The topics of the two proposed VFT-Experience Box pairings are Bizarre Animals: The Ediacara of South Australia and Meteorites: Travelers in Space and Time. To accomplish the proposed work, we have developed a novel collaboration between the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI) Team, the Center for Meteorite Studies (CMS) and the Mars Education Program at Arizona State University (ASU), and The Field Museum (TFM), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Australian Centre for Astrobiology.  VFTs transport users to remote environments where they can explore terrain and experience what it is like to ""do science"" in the field. This virtual experience is dynamic, immersive and interactive with 360## sphericals that open windows onto Gigapan imagery that allow a user to examine rock faces in close-ups that mimic actual presence at the rock face. The proposed work will leverage the availability of a VFT from the ASU NAI Team on early life (featuring the Ediacara fossil biota in Australia) for the Bizarre Animals VFT. The proposed work will create a new VFT to the Barringer Meteor Crater (Arizona) for the Meteorites VFT. The Web-based nature of the VFTs make them accessible to students, educators and the public worldwide. The Experience Boxes enhance the VFTs by connecting real objects (rocks, fossils, models) with the selected virtual environments. The Bizzare Animals Experience Box will contain specimens such as fossil casts and the Meteorites Experience Box will contain specimens such as meteorites and impact-related rocks. TFM's Harris Educational Loan Center, one of the largest teacher loan centers in the United States, will provide its expertise in producing hands-on objects and developing Standards-aligned content for the Experience Boxes. Experience Boxes will reside at TFM, ASU and MIT, making them available to three of the 60 largest school districts in the nation.  Digital versions of the Experience Boxes will extend the reach of the VFTs and Experience Boxes outside of the geographic areas served by ASU, TFM and MIT. We will use new technologies to create virtual objects, or ""cyberspecimens"", that can be studied, manipulated and magnified by the user. The virtual objects will enhance the VFT experience by allowing students to interact with science objects in new ways. The virtual objects will be accompanied by digital versions of the other Experience Box contents (e.g., images, movies) and the educator materials to guide use of the VFTs and virtual objects.  To develop teacher knowledge of the subjects covered by the VFTs and Experience Boxes and to train teachers in their use, a series of workshops will be offered at ASU and TFM. Video clips taken from these events will be used to create an online (and therefore widely accessible) training gallery of short videos modelling the use of the Experience Boxes and VFTs and showing classroom footage of the materials. Project assessment will be done by external evaluators and by a small group of teachers who will be involved in the Experience Box and VFT development. By blending immersive digital experiences with the excitement of authentic objects, we hope to improve teaching and learning of STEM topics in elementary, secondary and informal education environments and to increase public engagement in STEM topics.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

They have been studied extensively in concentrates made from acid-insoluble residues, but surprisingly little is known about their petrologic settings in the meteorites because they have not been studied in situ. Information about such settings is fundamental for determining how they formed and were incorporated into the meteorites. The primary goal of the planned research is to determine and compare the petrologic settings of NDs within matrix of different types of carbonaceous chondrites, with the long-term aim of providing new insights regarding the origin of NDs. This research will also provide new data on the structure and major and trace element compositions of individual NDs and regions within them. Transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) provide uniquely powerful information regarding chemical, bonding, and structural data on the scale needed to solve this problem, assuming the NDs can be located within the host matrix. We have developed methods of observing NDs in situ within the fine-grained matrix of primitive meteorites and will use various TEMs to accomplish that goal for several meteorites. High-resolution imaging and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) will permit determination of both structural and chemical information about the NDs and their adjacent minerals. By the middle of the proposed grant period, two state-of-the-art, aberration-corrected TEMs will have been installed at ASU and will be used to locate heavy elements such as Xe, Te, and Pd within the NDs. These TEMs permit the imaging of individual atoms of heavy elements with annular dark-field (ADF) imaging, and these atoms can be identified using EELS. The result of these new types of measurements will provide information about whether such elements, which have been used to determine whether NDs formed in supernovae, occur within the interiors or on the surfaces of the NDs.

THE EARTH&#039;S MANTLE IS COMPOSED OF ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS, THEY ARE COMMON IN ASTEROIDS AND ON MARS, AND ARE THOUGHT TO BE PRESENT IN ICY SATELLITES THROUGHOUT THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM. WHEN ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS REACT WITH WATER, THE ALTERED ROCKS CONTAIN HYDROUS SILICATE MINERALS OF THE SERPENTINE GROUP, SO THE ALTERATION OF ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS IS CALLED SERPENTINIZATION. THIS IS THE MOST COMMON AND ARGUABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ALTERATION REACTION IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM. DURING SERPENTINIZATION, SOME OF THE WATER IS REDUCED TO HYDROGEN AS FERROUS IRON IS OXIDIZED TO FERRIC IRON. THE PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN DURING SERPENTINIZATION CREATES THE MOST REDUCED AQUEOUS FLUIDS FOUND ON THE EARTH. THESE REDUCED CONDITIONS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR ABIOTIC SYNTHESIS OF METHANE AND ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. BECAUSE SERPENTINIZATION IS WIDESPREAD ACROSS OUR SOLAR SYSTEM, ITS ROLE IN ABIOTIC ORGANIC SYNTHESIS MAY BE AS WELL. THE SAME CONDITIONS ARE IDEAL FOR SUPPORTING METHANOGENS, MICROBES THAT GAIN ENERGY BY REDUCING CARBON DIOXIDE WITH HYDROGEN TO PRODUCE METHANE. IT FOLLOWS THAT SERPENTINIZATION MAY REPRESENT ONE OF THE EARLIEST HABITAT-FORMING PROCESSES ON EARTH.

IN OUR DATA, CONCENTRATIONS OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC) IN SERPENTINIZING FLUIDS ARE ALWAYS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THE DOC IN SURFACE WATER. AT THE SAME TIME, THE DOC IN THE SERPENTINIZATION FLUIDS REPRESENTS ONLY A FRACTION OF THE DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON (DIC) IN THE SURFACE WATER.

THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO EXPLORE WHETHER THE METHANE AND DOC FORMED DURING SERPENTINIZATION IS DRIVEN BY BIOTIC OR ABIOTIC PROCESSES. WE WILL DETERMINE WHETHER MICROBES ARE PRESENT IN THE ZONE OF ACTIVE SERPENTINIZATION, AND WHETHER THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE METHANE AND DOC IN THE SERPENTINIZING FLUIDS.

PROF. BELL HAS LEFT CORNELL AND HAS TAKEN A NEW POSITION AS A PROFESSOR IN THE SCHOOL OF EARTH AND SPACE EXPLORATION (SESE) AT ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY IN TEMPE. THE ORIGINALLY-FUNDED RESEARCH ON THIS TOPIC HAD THREE PRIMARY TASKS: (1) ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN AND ASSISTANCE WITH THE LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER CAMERAS (LROC) TEAM''S DATA REDUCTION, CALIBRATION AND ARCHIVING PLANS, BASED ON PROF. BELL''S EXPERIENCE WITH DATA REDUCTION, CALIBRATION, AND ARCHIVING TASKS FOR THE FUNCTIONALLY-SIMILAR MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (MRO) CONTEXT CAMERA (CTX) AND MARS COLOR IMAGER (MARCI); (2) AN ACTIVE, TACTICAL-TIMESCALE STUDY OF THE MINERALOGY AND MORPHOLOGY OF PYROCLASTIC DARKMANTLED DEPOSITS USING A COMBINATION OF LROC AND OTHER NEW AND PREVIOUS LUNAR REMOTE SENSING DATA SETS; AND (3) AN ACTIVE, TACTICAL-TIMESCALE STUDY OF THE LOCATIONS, PHYSICAL PROPERTIES, AND GEOLOGIC IMPLICATIONS OF HIGHLAND SCARP TECTONIC FEATURES. WE MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS ON ALL OF THESE TASKS DURING THE THREE AND A HALF YEAR DURATION OF THIS AWARD AT CORNELL. OUR EXPECTATION IS TO COMPLETE THE REMAINING WORK DURING 2012 ONCE JIM BELL: NEW ASU MDAP COMPLETION PROPOSAL 2 2 THIS GRANT IS TRANSFERRED TO A NEW GRANT AT ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY, THE PI''S NEW PRIMARY INSTITUTIONAL AFFILIATION.

DEVELOPING A COMPLETE PICTURE OF THIS HISTORY IS CENTRAL TO UNDERSTANDING OUR COSMIC ORIGINS. YET WE HAVE LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE FIRST BILLION YEARS WHEN THE FIRST GALAXIES AND BLACK HOLES FORMED AND THE UNIVERSE UNDERWENT A GLOBAL PHASE TRANSITION FROM NEUTRAL TO IONIZED DURING THE EPOCH OF REIONIZATION (EOR). DURING THIS ERA OF COSMIC DAWN ARE SOME OF THE MOST CRITICAL EVENTS IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE. IT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL PERIOD WHEN PRIMORDIAL DENSITY FLUCTUATIONS FOLLOWING INFLATION EVOLVED THROUGH BARYON IN-FALL, ADIABATIC COOLING, AND GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE TO CREATE COMPACT STRUCTURES FOR THE FIRST TIME. BUT PROBING THIS ERA IS BEYOND THE CAPABILITIES OF TODAY\'S INSTRUMENTS. NEW APPROACHES ARE NEEDED TO ENABLE BREAK-THROUGH OBSERVATIONS. ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING NEW TECHNIQUES FOR PROBING COSMIC DAWN IS LOW-FREQUENCY RADIO OBSERVATION OF THE REDSHIFTED 21CM LINE OF NEUTRAL HYDROGEN GAS. IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE, THE INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM (IGM) IS DOMINATED BY NEUTRAL HYDROGEN GAS. THE THERMAL AND IONIZATION HISTORY OF THE INTERGALACTIC GAS ENCODES UNIQUE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROPERTIES OF THE FIRST STARS, GALAXIES, AND BLACK HOLES. THE EVOLUTION OF ABSORPTION AND EMISSION FEATURES IN THE DIFFUSE REDSHIFTED 21 CM LINE RELATIVE TO THE COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND (CMB) WILL BE IMPRINTED SPECTRALLY IN THE ALL-SKY AVERAGE RADIO BACKGROUND BETWEEN 40 AND 200 MHZ (WAVELENGTHS BETWEEN 1.5 AND 8 METERS), SINCE REDSHIFT MAPS TO WAVELENGTH FOR THE 21 CM LINE. THE BEST MEASUREMENTS OF THE GLOBAL 21 CM SIGNAL FROM COSMIC DAWN WILL BE ACQUIRED FROM SPACE. ALTHOUGH THIS WAVELENGTH RANGE IS GENERALLY ACCESSIBLE FROM THE GROUND, THE EARTH S IONOSPHERE SEVERELY COMPLICATES THE OBSERVATIONS BELOW 80 MHZ AND RADIO FREQUENCY INTERFERENCE FROM TERRESTRIAL TRANSMITTERS, INCLUDING FM RADIO AND TELEVISION, LIMITS THE AVAILABLE SPECTRUM, EVEN AT VERY REMOTE, RADIO-QUIET SITES. DETECTING THE WEAK COMIC DAWN SIGNAL UNDER MUCH BRIGHTER GALACTIC AND EXTRAGALACTIC FOREGROUNDS WILL REQUIRE A HIGH-PRECISION, WIDEBAND RADIO SPECTROMETER WITH THE UNIQUE PROPERTY THAT ITS RELATIVE SPECTRAL RESPONSE OVER LARGE FRACTIONAL WAVEBANDS IS WELL UNDERSTOOD AT BETTER THAN 1 PART IN 10,000. SUCH A SPECTROMETER WILL EXPLOIT THE DIFFERENCE IN COHERENCE LENGTH BETWEEN THE 21 CM SIGNAL AND THE POWER-LAW SPECTRUM OF THE FOREGROUND SYNCHROTRON EMISSION TO SEPARATE THE TWO COMPONENTS IN OBSERVATIONS. THEWIDEBAND SPECTRAL PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT FOR THE COSMIC DAWN RECEIVER IS TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE BEYOND EXISTING RADIO INSTRUMENTS AND NEW TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT IS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THE PERFORMANCE GOALS IN A FLIGHT-QUALIFIED INSTRUMENT. HERE, WE PROPOSE A CONCEPT STUDY TO IDENTIFY THE BEST WIDEBAND RECEIVER DESIGN. THE OUTCOME OF THE STUDY WILL LEAD TO A NEXT-GENERATION RECEIVER THAT WILL BE BUILT AND VALIDATED IN THE SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. A PROTOTYPE RECEIVER WILL BE EVALUATED DURING THE CONCEPT STUDY THAT IS BASED ON DESIGN LESSONS FROM A GROUND-BASED PRECURSOR THAT ISOLATE DESIGN CHALLENGES TO THE ELECTRICAL INTERFACE BETWEEN THE ANTENNA AND FIRST-STAGE AMPLIFIERS. THE PROTOTYPE RECEIVER UTILIZES A DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER CONFIGURATION THAT IS COMMON IN SPACE-QUALIFIED SYSTEMS. BOTH DESIGNS FEATURE CALIBRATION NOISE SOURCES INJECTED BEFORE THE FIRST-STAGE AMPLIFIERS, BUT THEY EXHIBIT DIFFERENT TECHNICAL COMPLICATIONS THAT MUST BE EVALUATED AND RESOLVED. THE RESEARCH ACTIVITIES PROPOSED HERE WILL ADVANCE THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE IN PRECISION WIDEBAND RECEIVER DESIGN. THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT HAS APPLICATIONS TO THE DARK AGES RADIO EXPLORE (DARE) MISSION CONCEPT AND TO FUTURE SPACE MISSIONS IN EARTH OBSERVING, SOLAR WEATHER, PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES, AND COSMOLOGY.",,,,,,,,,,,,

THIS SMALL, LOW-COST CAMERA WOULD COMPLEMENT THE VISIBLE IMAGERS TYPICALLY FLOWN ON PLANETARY MISSIONS. INFRARED MICROBOLOMETERS HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL FOR PLANETARY EXPLORATION BECAUSE THEY DO NOT REQUIRE COOLING, ARE INHERENTLY SENSITIVE OVER A VERY BROAD SPECTRAL RANGE, ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN 640X480 ELEMENT ARRAYS, AND ARE LOW MASS AND LOW POWER DEVICES. WE PLAN A MODULAR INSTRUMENT CONCEPT BUILT AROUND THE MICROBOLOMETER, IN WHICH THE FORE-OPTICS AND SPECTRAL APPROACH WOULD VARY WITH MISSION CONCEPT. THE EFFORT PROPOSED HERE FOCUSES ON THE MICROBOLOMETER AND ITS CHARACTERIZATION, WITH AN EXAMPLE PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT DEVELOPED TO DEMONSTRATE A MICROBOLMETER S CAPABILITY. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT IR IMAGERS IN THE CLASS PLANNED WOULD BE 5-10 CM APERTURE,  COFFEE MUG  SIZED INSTRUMENTS. WE DEVELOPED THE FIRST MICROBOLOMETER FOR PLANETARY USE FOR THE MARS ODYSSEY THEMIS IR IMAGER. THIS IMAGER, HOWEVER, ONLY UTILIZED THE 6-15?M SPECTRAL RANGE AND ONLY HAD 320X240 ELEMENTS. AN IMPROVED IR IMAGER HAS BROAD APPLICATIONS TO MAP COMPOSITION USING THE FULL INFRARED SPECTRAL RANGE, MAP TEMPERATURE, AND ON MISSIONS TO COLD OBJECTS WHERE DETECTORS WITH LONG WAVELENGTH PERFORMANCE ARE HIGHLY DESIRABLE. MICROBOLOMETERS, WHILE LESS SENSITIVE THAN COOLED DETECTORS, HAVE AN IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE OVER THESE DEVICES BECAUSE THEY CAN DETECT ENERGY AT ALL WAVELENGTHS, WHEREAS COOLED DETECTORS ARE LIMITED TO WAVELENGTHS<15?M. EXPERIENCE WITH MARS GLOBAL SURVEYOR TES AND THE MARS EXPLORATION ROVER MINI-TES DATA DEMONSTRATED THAT WAVELENGTHS>15?M CONTAIN SOME OF THE MOST DIAGNOSTIC SPECTRAL INFORMATION. SPECTROMETERS AND MULTI-SPECTRAL IMAGERS USING COOLED DETECTORS THEREFORE HAVE ONLY LIMITED UTILITY IN SPECTRAL ANALYSIS, AND ARE FURTHER LIMITED FOR COLD, OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM OBJECTS WHERE THE PEAK OF THE EMITTED ENERGY OCCURS IN THE 20-50?M REGION. THE DEVELOPMENT OF MICROBOLOMETER ARRAYS THAT ARE SENSITIVE OVER A WIDE SPECTRAL RANGE (3 TO 100?M) HAS DIRECT APPLICATION TO FUTURE MARS, LUNAR, AND INNER PLANET MISSIONS WHERE LOW COST, HIGH-PERFORMANCE IR IMAGERS AND SPECTROMETERS WILL PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN THE STUDY OF SURFACE AND ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES. THEY WOULD BE USEFUL ON ROVERS AND LANDERS WHERE RAPID, MULTI-SPECTRAL IMAGING WOULD PROVIDE CRITICAL COMPOSITIONAL INFORMATION FOR TRAVERSE AND OPERATIONS PLANNING. AND THESE SIMPLE, LOW COST, LOW MASS IMAGERS COULD PROVIDE A COMPLEMENT TO VISIBLE/NEAR-IR IMAGING ON VIRTUALLY ANY MISSION. HOWEVER, AT PRESENT THE USE OF MICROBOLOMETERS ON PLANETARY MISSIONS IS LIMITED BECAUSE THEIR PERFORMANCE OVER AN EXTENDED SPECTRAL RANGE (3 TO 100?M) HAS NOT BEEN CHARACTERIZED. WE PROPOSE TO ADDRESS THIS LIMITATION BY DEVELOPING AND TESTING A SMALL, MICROBOLOMETER-BASED IMAGER THAT IS SENSITIVE OVER A BROAD SPECTRAL RANGE. THIS WORK WILL DEVELOP A 640X480 PIXEL FOCAL PLANE ASSEMBLY (FPA) THAT IS BASED ON THE 320X240 PIXEL MICROBOLOMETER ARRAY THAT WAS FLOWN IN THE MARS ODYSSEY THEMIS IR CAMERA. THE GOAL OF THIS EFFORT IS TO PRODUCE A WORKING PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT AND DEMONSTRATE THE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE OVER A SPECTRAL RANGE OF 3 TO 100?M. THE SPECIFIC TASKS OF THIS EFFORT ARE TO: 1) FULLY CHARACTERIZE THE RADIOMETRIC PERFORMANCE FROM 3 TO 100?M OF AN EXISTING 640X480 MICROBOLOMETER THAT WILL BE MODIFIED TO USE A LONG-WAVELENGTH TRANSMISSIVE DIAMOND WINDOW. 2) DESIGN AND DEVELOP A FILTER WHEEL ASSEMBLY AND REFLECTIVE OPTICAL SYSTEM THAT ARE OPTIMIZED TO THE MICROBOLOMETER FOCAL PLANE ASSEMBLY TO PROVIDE HIGH-QUALITY MULTI-SPECTRAL IMAGING. 3) INTEGRATE THE MICROBOLOMETER, FILTER WHEEL, AND OPTICS, AND TEST AND CALIBRATE THIS SYSTEM TO PRODUCE A SMALL, LOW-MASS PROTOTYPE IR MULTI-SPECTRAL IMAGER FOR USE ON PLANETARY MISSIONS. 4) CO",,,,,,,,,,,,

A RECENT DISCOVERY OF CARBONATE-RICH ROCKS IN THE COLUMBIA HILLS MADE POSSIBLE IN PART BY REVISITING FOUR-YEAR-OLD MINI-TES SPECTRA, HIGHLIGHTS OUR MOTIVATION TO CONTINUE INVESTIGATING SPIRIT&#039;S MINI-TES DATA SET. THIS DISCOVERY WAS IMPEDED BY DUST IN THE MARTIAN ENVIRONMENT, WHICH PRODUCES SIGNIFICANT BUT CORRECTABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO MINI-TES SPECTRA. TASK 1 ADDRESSES DUST CORRECTIONS THAT FALL OUTSIDE THE DOMAIN OF THE MINI-TES TEAM&#039;S REQUIREMENT TO PRODUCE CALIBRATED RADIANCE SPECTRA. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND REMOVE THE FEATURES IN MINI-TES SPECTRA PRODUCED BY MARTIAN DUST, LEADING TO IMPROVED MINERAL IDENTIFICATION. THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM MINI-TES OBSERVATIONS OF GUSEV CRATER CARBONATE AND THE OPALINE SILICA OCCURRENCES AT HOME PLATE HAS NOT YET BEEN FULLY DEVELOPED. HUNDREDS OF MINI-TES OBSERVATIONS RELATING TO THE GEOLOGIC CONTEXT AND STRATIGRAPHY OF THESE OCCURRENCES HAVE NOT BEEN SCRUTINIZED. TASKS 2 AND 3 WILL INCORPORATE THESE OBSERVATIONS, LABORATORY SPECTRA FROM OTHER NASA FUNDED PROJECTS, AND VARIOUS ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO OBTAIN NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE SILICA AND CARBONATE OCCURRENCES THAT CAN BE USED TO BETTER CONSTRAIN THEIR ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE. WE EXPECT THAT THE RESULTS FROM THESE TASKS WILL PROVIDE A MORE THOROUGH EVALUATION OF THE ROLE OF WATER AND OTHER GEOLOGIC PROCESSES IN GUSEV CRATER. ALTHOUGH EVIDENCE OF AN ANCIENT LAKE REMAINS ELUSIVE, SPIRIT HAS ENCOUNTERED AN UNEXPECTEDLY RICH ASSEMBLAGE OF AQUEOUSLY DERIVED MATERIALS AS WELL AS IGNEOUS ROCKS THROUGHOUT THE COLUMBIA HILLS REGION. MINI-TES SPECTRA ALREADY HAVE SERVED TO EXPAND OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE MINERALOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SOME OF THESE MATERIALS, BUT IN MANY CASES THE ANALYSES REMAIN PRELIMINARY. THE WORK WE ARE PROPOSING WILL HELP TO REMEDY THIS SITUATION, ALLOWING A MORE THOROUGH CHARACTERIZATION OF THE AQUEOUS HISTORY AND POSSIBLE HABITABILITY OF THE GUSEV SITE.",,,,,,,,,,,,

WE HAVE SELECTED TO USE A WELL-ESTABLISHED WATER STRESS INDEX TO CONDUCT DROUGHT MONITORING AND DECISION-MAKER ENGAGEMENT AT MULTIPLE SCALES, WITH A FOCUS ON DROUGHT-PRONE AREAS IN NORTHWEST MEXICO AND NORTHEAST BRAZIL. IN THE PROJECT, WE WILL EXPAND THE CAPABILITIES OF THE SECURE, CLOUD-BASED GEOSPATIAL PLATFORM TO INCORPORATE DROUGHT MONITORING AND CHANGE DETECTION USING FREQUENT, HIGH-RESOLUTION REMOTE SENSING DATA AND HYDROLOGIC MODEL OUTPUTS AT THE BASIN-LEVEL.

CRITICAL QUESTIONS REMAIN ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF THESE CARBONATE MINERALS, ESPECIALLY THE TEMPERATURE AND FORMATION PROCESSES.

LODDERS, 2003; PALME AND JONES, 2003) AND SOLAR PHOTOSPHERIC CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES (E.G. ASPLUND ET AL., 2006). THE OUTER PORTION OF THE SUN, THE SOLAR PHOTOSPHERE, IS THOUGHT TO BE DECOUPLED FROM NUCLEOSYNTHETIC PROCESSES, LEAVING IT ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED IN COMPOSITION FROM THAT OF THE EARLY SOLAR NEBULA (BOCHSLER, 2000). IONIZED PARTICLES ARE ACCELERATED BY THE SOLAR MAGNETIC FIELD OUT OF THE PHOTOSPHERE, CONSTITUTING WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE SOLAR WIND. BY SAMPLING THE SOLAR WIND, IT IS THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE TO ANALYZE THE CHEMISTRY OF THE PHOTOSPHERE IN TERRESTRIAL LABORATORIES AND DRAW CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE EARLY SOLAR NEBULA; THIS IS THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH. SOLAR WIND (SW) IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR SOLAR ABUNDANCES OF VOLATILE ELEMENTS (BOCHSLER, 2007). THE GENESIS MISSION SURPASSED THE APOLLO 16 SOLAR WIND COMPOSITION EXPERIMENT BY RETURNING THE LONGEST EXPOSURE SOLAR WIND SAMPLE TO DATE (REISENFELD ET AL., 2007), MAKING ITS COLLECTOR ARRAYS PARTICULARLY VALUABLE FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF SW MINOR ELEMENT ABUNDANCES AND ISOTOPIC COMPOSITIONS (E.G., HEBER ET AL., 2009; JUREWICZ ET AL., 2009; RIECK ET AL., 2010). ONE HIGHLY VOLATILE ELEMENT THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN WELL-STUDIED IN THE GENESIS COLLECTOR ARRAYS, BUT IS PRESENT IN SUFFICIENT CONCENTRATION FOR SIMS ANALYSIS, IS NA. WE WILL MEASURE SW FLUENCES OF NA IN THE NASA GENESIS SPACECRAFT DIAMOND-LIKE CARBON (DLC) BULK COLLECTOR WAFERS. IN ADDITION, IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER GENESIS TEAM MEMBERS, THE ABUNDANCES OF CA AND CR WILL BE ANALYZED IN THESE WAFERS TO ASSESS THE CONSISTENCY OF THESE DATA BETWEEN LABORATORIES. RECONNAISSANCE MEASUREMENTS OF NA, CA, AND CR WERE PERFORMED PREVIOUSLY BY OTHER INVESTIGATORS ON THE ASU 6F SIMS AND THE UCLA 1270 SIMS (E.G. JUREWICZ ET AL., 2007; BURNETT ET AL., 2007) AS WELL AS RIMS (VERYOVKIN ET AL., 2010A, B). THIS PRIOR WORK, ALL USING TRADITIONAL DEPTH PROFILING, DEMONSTRATED THAT THESE ELEMENTS ARE, INDEED, ABUNDANT ENOUGH TO BE MEASURED USING SIMS. HOWEVER, IN ALL CASES, SURFACE CONTAMINATION DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS CREATED UNACCEPTABLE INTERFERENCE WITH THE SW SIGNAL. WE BELIEVE WE CAN ADDRESS THIS ANALYTICAL CHALLENGE BY CONDUCTING BACKSIDE DEPTH PROFILING INTO THE DLC COLLECTOR WAFERS USING SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY (SIMS). BACKSIDE DEPTH PROFILING HAS RECENTLY BEEN DEVELOPED FOR ANALYSIS OF GENESIS SI COLLECTORS (E.G., HEBER ET AL., 2012) TO REDUCE THE CONTRIBUTION OF SURFACE PARTICULATE CONTAMINATION AND PERMIT ION BEAM STABILIZATION PRIOR TO ENCOUNTERING IMPLANTED IONS. THAT NA, CA, AND CR ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE RELATIVELY HIGH FLUENCES IN THE GENESIS BULK COLLECTOR WAFERS (1.1E11, 1.2E11, AND 2.6E10 ATOMS/CM2 RESPECTIVELY; BURNETT ET AL., 2003) SHOULD ALSO FACILITATE PRECISE AND ACCURATE ANALYSES.",,,,,,,,,,,,

IT IS ALSO ANTICIPATED THAT SUCH STUDIES WILL LEAD TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE SO-CALLED  FUN  CALCIUM-ALUMINUM-RICH INCLUSIONS (CAIS). THESE INCLUSIONS HAVE ISOTOPIC COMPOSITIONS THAT EXHIBIT LARGE, MASS-DEPENDENT FRACTIONATIONS AND UNKNOWN NUCLEAR (FUN) EFFECTS, AND ALSO HAVE UNRESOLVABLE EXCESSES IN 26MG* (WASSERBURG ET AL., 1977).

THE PROPOSED WORK WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT INSIGHTS INTO THE CHRONOLOGY AND FORMATION ENVIRONMENT OF THE EARLIEST-FORMED SOLIDS IN SOLAR SYSTEM AND IS RELEVANT TO SCIENCE QUESTIONS LISTED IN THE SMD SCIENCE PLAN FOR 2007-2016. IN PARTICULAR, THIS RESEARCH ADDRESSES THE FOLLOWING SCIENCE QUESTIONS:  HOW DID THE SUN S FAMILY OF PLANETS AND MINOR BODIES ORIGINATE?  AND  HOW DID THE SOLAR SYSTEM EVOLVE TO ITS CURRENT DIVERSE STATE? .",,,,,,,,,,,,

ACHIEVING THIS GOAL REQUIRES THE PRECISE AND ACCURATE DATING OF LUNAR ROCKS THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY IMPACTS (IMPACTITES). THE 40AR/39AR METHOD HAS BEEN WIDELY USED TO DATE IMPACT EVENTS SINCE THE K-AR ISOTOPIC SYSTEM MAY BE RESET DURING IMPACTS, AND BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THE EFFECTIVE ANALYSIS OF SMALL QUANTITIES OF RARE SAMPLES. CONVENTIONAL 40AR/39AR TECHNIQUES TYPICALLY INVOLVE STEP-HEATING OF SMALL WHOLE-ROCK FRAGMENTS OR MINERAL SEPARATES IN A FURNACE OR BY INFRARED LASERS TO RELEASE GASSES FOR ANALYSIS IN A MASS SPECTROMETER. IN MOST CASES, THE PETROGRAPHIC CONTEXT OF THE DATED MATERIAL IS LOST IN THE PROCESS OF ISOLATING IT FOR ANALYSIS, AND THE PRESENCE OF UNMELTED MINERALS MAY ENGENDER AGE INTERPRETATIONS THAT ARE AMBIGUOUS OR THAT HAVE LITTLE GEOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE TIMING OF IMPACT. ADDITIONALLY, THE THERMAL HISTORIES OF LUNAR IMPACTITES ARE COMPLEX, AND MAY BE REFLECTED BY MULTIPLE GENERATIONS OF IMPACT MELTS AND SHOCK EFFECTS WITHIN INDIVIDUAL SAMPLES. THE APPLICATION OF ULTRAVIOLET (UV) LASER ABLATION TECHNIQUES IN 40AR/39AR GEOCHRONOLOGY PROVIDES THE ABILITY TO STUDY SUCH COMPLEXITIES IN PETROGRAPHIC CONTEXT. FOR EXAMPLE, UV LASER MICROPROBES HAVE REVOLUTIONIZED 40AR/39AR STUDIES OF COMPLEX, PARTIALLY-MELTED MATERIALS (PSEUDOTACHYLITES) ALONG TERRESTRIAL FAULT ZONES, REVEALING MULTIPLE STAGES OF FAULT MOVEMENT. WE PROPOSE TO CONDUCT DETAILED PETROLOGY AND UV LASER MICROPROBE 40AR/39AR GEOCHRONOLOGY OF APOLLO 16 IMPACTITES IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR COMPLEX THERMAL HISTORIES, AND TO IMPROVE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE IMPACT RECORD IN THE DESCARTES-CAYLEY PLAINS. THUS, WE HOPE TO CLARIFY OR EXPAND UPON PREVIOUS IMPACT CHRONOLOGIES DEVELOPED WITH CONVENTIONAL 40AR/39AR TECHNIQUES, AND TO THEREBY ADDRESS SOME OF NASA S TOP PRIORITIES IN LUNAR SCIENCE.",,,,,,,,,,,,

THIS EXPANDED FRAMEWORK WILL ENABLE A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE AND A MEANS OF QUANTIFYING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CLIMATE MITIGATION POLICIES. THIS CMS-FPP IS MOTIVATED BY THE INCREASE IN TROPOSPHERIC CO2 FROM ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS, WHICH IS THE SINGLE LARGEST DRIVER OF OBSERVED AND PREDICTED CLIMATE CHANGE [FORSTER ET AL, 2007]. HOWEVER, ROUGHLY HALF OF THE CO2 PRODUCED FROM THESE EMISSIONS HAS BEEN REMOVED BY TERRESTRIAL AND OCEAN SINKS. CONSEQUENTLY, THE FUTURE TRAJECTORY OF CLIMATE FORCING WILL DEPEND ON FUTURE EMISSIONS AND ON THE CAPACITY OF THE CARBON-CYCLE TO ABSORB MORE CO2 [FRIEDLINGSTEIN, 2008]. RECENT YEARS HAVE SEEN AN ACCELERATION OF FOSSIL FUEL EMISSIONS AND SIGNS OF AN ONSET OF CARBON-CYCLE FEEDBACKS [CANADELL ET AL, 2007]. SINCE 2005, FOSSIL FUEL EMISSIONS HAVE BEEN REGIONALLY REDISTRIBUTED TOWARDS DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WHICH NOW MAKE UP MORE THAN HALF OF CO2 EMISSIONS (&gt;4 PGC/YR) [PETERS ET AL, 2012]. WHILE THE GLOBAL CARBON BUDGET AND ITS PARTITIONING BETWEEN ANTHROPOGENIC, TERRESTRIAL, AND OCEANIC FLUXES ARE REASONABLY UNDERSTOOD, THE CONTRIBUTION OF REGIONAL DRIVERS TO THAT BUDGET ARE NOT [CANADELL ET AL, 2010]. CONSEQUENTLY, UNCERTAINTY IN THE ATTRIBUTION OF CO2 ACCUMULATION RATE ON A YEAR-TO-YEAR BASIS TO THOSE DRIVERS LIMITS OUR CAPACITY TO QUANTIFY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CLIMATE MITIGATION POLICIES [LE QUERE ET AL, 2009]. IN ORDER TO REDUCE UNCERTAINTY IN CO2 ATTRIBUTION, WE WILL SIMULTANEOUSLY IMPROVE AND AUGMENT ALL MAJOR ASPECTS OF THE CURRENT CMS-FPP: NEW SATELLITES OBSERVATIONS, AN ADDITIONAL TERRESTRIAL ECO-SYSTEM MODEL, A NEW FOSSIL FUEL ASSIMILATION SYSTEM, UPDATED OCEAN ASSIMILATION ALGORITHMS, AND IMPROVED ATMOSPHERIC INVERSION ALGORITHMS. THE CMS-FPP PHASE 2 WILL GENERATE A SUITE OF NEW AND UPDATED PRODUCTS COVERING 7/2009-2011 INCLUDING NEW GLOBAL SPATIALLY RESOLVED CO2 SOURCES AND SINKS, NEW HIGH RESOLUTION GLOBAL FOSSIL FUEL EMISSIONS, BETTER ESTIMATES OF OCEANIC CO2 AIR-SEA EXCHANGE, NEW ESTIMATES OF GLOBAL ABOVE-GROUND BIOMASS, AND REFINEMENTS IN TOP-DOWN ATTRIBUTION AND UNCERTAINTY ALGORITHMS. PRODUCTS GENERATED FROM BOTTOM-UP AND TOP-DOWN ESTIMATES WILL BE MADE PUBLICALLY AVAILABLE THROUGH CARBON.NASA.GOV AND LINKED TO CMSFLUX.JPL.NASA.GOV.

A NEW GENERATION OF SPACE-BORNE SENSORS ON THE SOIL MOISTURE OCEAN SALINITY MISSION (SMOS) AND SOIL MOISTURE ACTIVE AND PASSIVE (SMAP) MISSION WILL LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IN THE GLOBAL ESTIMATION OF SURFACE SOIL MOISTURE. NEVERTHELESS, THESE NEW ESTIMATES WILL STILL HAVE COARSE RESOLUTIONS AS COMPARED TO EXISTING GROUND NETWORKS (#tilde#10S M) AND AIRCRAFT-BASED ESTIMATES (#tilde#1 KM). AS A RESULT, A MAJOR CHALLENGE IS HOW TO PROPERLY DOWNSCALE (OR DISAGGREGATE) THESE COARSE (BUT RELATIVELY ACCURATE) ESTIMATES TO RESOLUTIONS THAT ARE MORE USEFUL FOR HYDROLOGIC, ECOLOGIC, AND CLIMATOLOGIC APPLICATIONS, AMONG OTHERS. UNFORTUNATELY, MANY EXISTING SOIL MOISTURE DOWNSCALING APPROACHES ARE NOT SUITED FOR OPERATIONAL AND GLOBAL APPLICATION DUE TO THEIR HIGH COMPUTATIONAL DEMAND, LARGE DATA AND PARAMETER REQUIREMENTS OR SITE-SPECIFICITY. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL USE A STATISTICAL DOWNSCALING MODEL FOR GENERATING HIGH-RESOLUTION SOIL MOISTURE FIELDS FROM COARSE SATELLITE DATA THAT HAS SHOWN PROMISE IN PRIOR APPLICATIONS. THE DOWNSCALING MODEL IS BASED ON SCALE-INVARIANCE AND MULTIFRACTAL PROPERTIES EXHIBITED BY SOIL MOISTURE FIELDS OBTAINED FROM AIRCRAFT-BASED SENSORS FLOWN DURING INTENSIVE NASA FIELD CAMPAIGNS. THE ALGORITHM HAS THE PROPERTIES THAT ARE SOUGHT FOR OPERATIONAL AND GLOBAL USE (I.E., LOW COMPUTATIONAL DEMAND AND A FEW PARAMETERS THAN CAN BE LINKED TO READILY-AVAILABLE DATA, ROBUSTNESS ACROSS MULTIPLE SITES). FURTHERMORE, THE DOWNSCALING METHOD GENERATES AN ENSEMBLE (A LARGE SET OF REALIZATIONS) OF HIGH-RESOLUTION SOIL MOISTURE FIELDS (#tilde#1 KM OR LESS) THAT STATISTICALLY ENCOMPASS AVAILABLE AIRCRAFT-BASED OBSERVATIONS. WE PROPOSE TWO MAJOR ACTIVITIES THAT WILL EXPAND THE USEFULNESS OF THE STATISTICAL DOWNSCALING MODEL. IN THE FIRST ACTIVITY, THE DOWNSCALING ALGORITHM WILL BE APPLIED TO ALL AVAILABLE AIRCRAFT-BASED DATA TO DEVELOP A ROBUST, MULTI-SITE CALIBRATION RELATION. THIS WILL BE CARRIED OUT FROM TWO COARSE RESOLUTIONS REPRESENTING THE OPERATIONAL AMRS-E (25 KM) AND FORTHCOMING SMAP (10 KM) PRODUCTS TO TEST THE VALUE ADDED BY THE NEW PRODUCT. IN THE SECOND ACTIVITY, THE DOWNSCALING MODEL WILL BE CALIBRATED USING HIGH-RESOLUTION (10 TO 100 M) SOIL MOISTURE FIELDS GENERATED BY A DISTRIBUTED HYDROLOGIC MODEL APPLIED TO BASINS WITHIN THE MULTIPLE STUDY SITES. MODEL-DERIVED SOIL MOISTURE FIELDS WILL ALLOW EXPANDING THE HYDROLOGIC CONDITIONS AND SCALE RANGE OF THE DOWNSCALING MODEL APPLICATION. FOR BOTH ACTIVITIES, THE ENSEMBLE SOIL MOISTURE FIELDS CAN SERVE AS A STATISTICAL BENCHMARK TO TEST THE USEFULNESS OF THE FORTHCOMING SMAP (AT ITS NATIVE RESOLUTION) AND TO OBTAIN THE SMALL-SCALE VARIABILITY WITHIN SMAP FOOTPRINTS FOR APPLICATIONS AT HIGH RESOLUTION.",,,,,,,,,,,,

IN PARTICULAR, A LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO INCREASE WATER RECOVERY FROM WASTEWATERS TO CREATE A CLOSED-LOOP WATER RECYCLING SYSTEM. CURRENTLY, IN THE WATER RECOVERY SYSTEM (WRS) USED ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS) ONLY 70% OF THE WASTEWATER GENERATED IS RECOVERED; THE REMAINING 30% OF THE WATER IS BRINE THAT IS STORED FOR LATER DISPOSAL. UNDER THIS SYSTEM, WASTEWATER RECYCLING IS DEPENDENT ON RESUPPLY OF WATER FROM THE GROUND TO THE ISS. SINCE NASA HAS RETIRED THE SPACE SHUTTLE FLEET, THE NEED TO MINIMIZE USE OF GROUND-BASED RESOURCES IS A HIGHER PRIORITY. AS A RESULT, NASA FACES THE CHALLENGE OF EITHER DEVELOPING NEW WASTEWATER RECYCLING SYSTEMS OR OPTIMIZING EXISTING ONES TO MAXIMIZE WATER RECOVERY. CURRENT OSMOTIC PROCESSES   BOTH REVERSE OSMOSIS (RO) AND FORWARD OSMOSIS (FO)   OFFER THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE WATER RECOVERY FROM WASTEWATERS CONSISTING OF RAW URINE, PRE-TREATED URINE, AND URINE BRINES. HOWEVER, COMMERCIAL RO AND FO MEMBRANES RAPIDLY DEGRADE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE ACIDIC PRE-TREATED URINE AND URINE BRINES. ADDITIONALLY, THESE COMMERCIAL RO AND FO MEMBRANES ARE FLAWED IN THAT THEY ARE NOT A SUFFICIENT BARRIER TO SMALL ORGANIC COMPOUNDS COMMONLY FOUND IN URINE, SUCH AS UREA. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A NEW CLASS OF CORROSION-RESISTANT MOLECULAR SIEVE INCLUSION NANOCOMPOSITE (MOSIN) MEMBRANES AND TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS FOR RECOVERING WATER FROM URINE AND URINE BRINE SOLUTIONS THROUGH OSMOTIC PROCESSES. IN OUR MOSIN MEMBRANES, A LIQUID-BARRIER, CHEMICAL-RESISTANT POLYMER MATRIX BINDS A LAYER OF SELECTIVE MOLECULAR SIEVE NANOPARTICLES INTO A FLEXIBLE, ROBUST NANOCOMPOSITE THIN FILM. THIS DESIGN LEVERAGES UNIQUE ASPECTS OF THE TWO COMPONENT MATERIALS: (1) THE HIGH INTRINSIC FLUX AND SELECTIVITY OF THE MOLECULAR SIEVE NANOPARTICLES AND (2) THE CORROSION-RESISTANCE, FLEXIBILITY, AND MECHANICAL ROBUSTNESS OF THE LIQUIDBARRIER POLYMER SUPPORT MATRIX. UNLIKE TRADITIONAL POLYMERIC LIQUID FILTRATION MEMBRANES, OUR DESIGN DOES NOT REQUIRE THE POLYMER MATRIX TO HAVE LIQUID PERMEABILITY A FACT THAT ENABLES US TO USE A BROADER SPECTRUM OF CORROSION-RESISTANT POLYMERS. TWO KEY ASPECTS OF THIS DESIGN CONCEPT ARE: (1) THE MOLECULAR SIEVE NANOPARTICLES PROVIDE A SINGLE PARTICLE PATHWAY THROUGH THE SUPPORTING POLYMERIC MATRIX BECAUSE THEY PENETRATE BOTH SIDES OF THE FILM AND (2) OUR MEMBRANES WILL BE FABRICATED THROUGH INEXPENSIVE POLYMER PROCESSING TECHNIQUES. WE WILL INCORPORATE HIGH PERMEABILITY WATER-SELECTIVE LINDE TYPE A (LTA) ZEOLITE MOLECULAR SIEVE NANOPARTICLES INTO CORROSION RESISTANT POLYMERIC THIN FILMS (POLYETHYLENE TEREPHTHALATE, HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE AND POLYTETRAFLUOROETHYLENE). WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE FUNDAMENTAL CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS WHICH INFLUENCE THE FORMATION OF OUR MOSIN MEMBRANES. IN PARTICULAR WE WILL INVESTIGATE HOW CHANGES IN FABRICATION PARAMETERS RELATE TO THE CHEMICAL STRUCTURE, PHYSICAL MORPHOLOGY, OSMOTIC SEPARATION PERFORMANCE, AND ZEOLITE/POLYMER INTERFACE USING A VARIETY OF CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES. WE WILL EVALUATE THE LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE AND CORROSION RESISTANCE OF THE MEMBRANES IN FORWARD OSMOSIS FOR DEWATERING OF SYNTHETIC URINE AND PRE-TREATED URINE.

STO-2 WILL ADDRESS A KEY PROBLEM IN MODERN ASTROPHYSICS, UNDERSTANDING THE LIFE CYCLE OF THE INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM (ISM). STO-2 WILL SURVEY APPROXIMATELY   OF THE SOUTHERN GALACTIC PLANE IN THE DOMINANT INTERSTELLAR COOLING LINE [CII] (158&#956;M) AND THE IMPORTANT STAR FORMATION TRACER [NII] (205&#956;M). WITH #tilde#1 ARCMINUTE ANGULAR RESOLUTION, STO-2 WILL SPATIALLY RESOLVE ATOMIC, IONIC AND MOLECULAR CLOUDS OUT TO 10 KPC. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ITS ENHANCED, EXTENDED LIFETIME CRYOGENIC RECEIVERS, THE STO-2 SURVEY WILL BE CONDUCTED AT UNPARALLELED SENSITIVITY LEVELS. STO-2 WILL UNIQUELY PROBE THE PIVOTAL FORMATIVE AND DISRUPTIVE STAGES IN THE LIFE CYCLE OF INTERSTELLAR CLOUDS AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GLOBAL STAR FORMATION RATES AND THE PROPERTIES OF THE ISM. COMBINED WITH PREVIOUS HI AND CO SURVEYS, STO-2 WILL CREATE 3-DIMENSIONAL MAPS OF THE STRUCTURE, DYNAMICS, TURBULENCE, ENERGY BALANCE, AND PRESSURE OF THE MILKY WAY''S ISM, AS WELL AS THE STAR FORMATION RATE. ONCE WE GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ISM PROPERTIES AND STAR FORMATION IN THE MILKY WAY, WE CAN BETTER INTERPRET OBSERVATIONS OF NEARBY GALAXIES AND THE DISTANT UNIVERSE. THE MISSION GOALS FOR THESE SURVEYS ARE TO: 1) DETERMINE THE LIFE CYCLE OF GALACTIC INTERSTELLAR GAS, 2) STUDY THE CREATION AND DISRUPTION OF STAR-FORMING CLOUDS IN THE GALAXY, 3) DETERMINE THE PARAMETERS THAT AFFECT THE STAR FORMATION RATE IN THE GALAXY, AND 4) PROVIDE TEMPLATES FOR STAR FORMATION AND STELLAR/INTERSTELLAR FEEDBACK IN OTHER GALAXIES. STO-2 WILL RE-USE THE 80CM TELESCOPE, GONDOLA, AND SUBSYSTEMS FROM STO-1. FOR THE STO-2 FLIGHT, STO-1 S HIGH SPECTRAL RESOLUTION (<1 KM/S) HETERODYNE RECEIVER SYSTEM WILL BE UPGRADED FOR EXTENDED CRYOGENIC LIFETIME, ENHANCED SENSITIVITY, AND GREATER RELIABILITY. THE FLIGHT RECEIVER HAS EIGHT, CRYOGENIC HEB MIXERS; FOUR OPTIMIZED FOR THE [CII] LINE AND FOUR FOR THE [NII] LINE. STO-2 WILL ALSO FLY AN UNCOOLED, SCHOTTKY RECEIVER TO OBSERVE THE 609&#956;M [CI] LINE AT 3 ARCMINUTE RESOLUTION. THE INSTRUMENT SPECTROMETER HAS SUFFICIENT BANDWIDTH TO DETECT ALL CLOUDS PARTICIPATING IN GALACTIC ROTATION IN EACH OF ITS 9 PIXELS. STO IS CAPABLE OF DETECTING EVERY GIANT MOLECULAR CLOUD, EVERY HII REGION OF SIGNIFICANCE, AND EVERY DIFFUSE HI CLOUD WITH (AV # 0.4) WITHIN ITS SURVEY REGION. THE STO-1 LAUNCH WAS ON 15 JANUARY 2012. BEFORE ACHIEVING FLOAT ALTITUDE A FROZEN ABSOLUTE PRESSURE REGULATOR VENTED APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE LIQUID HELIUM SUPPLY TO THE ATMOSPHERE. THIS EVENT REDUCED THE CRYOGENIC (THZ) PORTION OF THE MISSION TO #tilde#5 DAYS. THE EFFICACY OF THE OBSERVATIONS CONDUCTED DURING THIS PERIOD WAS HINDERED BY SEVERAL TECHNICAL ISSUES EXPERIENCED EARLY IN THE FLIGHT. THE CAUSES OF THESE ISSUES WERE IDENTIFIED AND CORRECTED IN FLIGHT. STO THEN TRANSITIONED INTO ITS `WARM MISSION  SCIENCE PROGRAM AND CONTINUED OBSERVATIONS USING AN UNCOOLED 492 GHZ [CI] RECEIVER UNTIL THE END OF ITS FLIGHT ON 29 JANUARY 2012. HERE WE PROPOSE TO RE-FLY STO WITH AN UPGRADED, MORE ROBUST CRYOGENIC/RECEIVER SYSTEM THAT WILL ALLOW THZ OBSERVATIONS TO CONTINUE UNTIL STRATOSPHERIC CONDITIONS OR RECOVERY CONSTRAINTS REQUIRE TERMINATING THE MISSION (UP TO #tilde#60 DAYS). STO-2 WILL BENEFIT TREMENDOUSLY FROM THE HERITAGE AND EXPERIENCE GAINED DURING THE STO-1 CAMPAIGN.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

MARGARITIFER TERRA IS HOME TO TWO MAIN CHANNEL SYSTEMS, THE UZBOI-LADON-MORAVA (ULM) SYSTEM AND THE SAMARA AND PARANA-LOIRE (SPL) SYSTEM, WHICH EXHIBIT DISPARATE FLUVIAL MORPHOLOGIES. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ULM AND SPL ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CRUSTAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE FLUVIAL SYSTEMS. WE WILL TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS BY DETERMINING CRUSTAL PROPERTIES THROUGH A SEQUENCE OF ANALYTICAL TASKS, WHICH CAN BE CATEGORIZED INTO TWO MAIN PHASES. THE FIRST PHASE WILL INCLUDE DETAILED COMPOSITIONAL MAPPING OF MARGARITIFER TERRA COUPLED WITH MORPHOLOGIC AND THERMOPHYSICAL CHARACTERIZATION AS A MEANS OF ASSESSING REGIONAL VARIATIONS THROUGHOUT THIS ANCIENT LANDSCAPE. ADDITIONAL ANALYSES OF HYPERSPECTRAL INFRARED DATA WILL BE USED TO UNIQUELY IDENTIFY PRIMARY AND SECONDARY MINERAL PHASES AND DETERMINE MINERALOGICAL DIFFERENCES ASSOCIATED WITH MAPPED VARIABILITY. THE SECOND PHASE WILL FOCUS ON DETERMINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT CRUSTAL UNITS AND THE PRESERVED AQUEOUS MORPHOLOGIES THROUGHOUT MARGARITIFER TERRA. THE CHARACTERIZATION OF CRUSTAL PROPERTIES ASSOCIATED WITH REGIONS OF SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE AQUEOUS ACTIVITY CAN HELP TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE LIFETIME OF LIQUID WATER ON THE MARTIAN SURFACE AS WELL AS ITS FATE PRIOR TO AND FOLLOWING EXPULSION FROM THE SUBSURFACE. AS AN AREA OF CONSIDERABLE INTEREST FOR LANDED SURFACE INVESTIGATIONS (E.G., HOLDEN AND EBERSWALDE CRATERS), IT IS ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTAND THE GEOLOGIC CONTEXT AND REGIONAL CRUSTAL PROPERTIES OF THE FLUVIAL MORPHOLOGIES IN MARGARITIFER TERRA. ADDITIONALLY, THIS WORK IS DIRECTLY APPLICABLE TO THE GOALS OF THE PLANETARY SCIENCE DECADAL SURVEY, WHICH EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE AND ORIGINS OF GEOLOGICAL UNITS AND AQUEOUS ENVIRONMENTS ON MARS. AS FLUVIAL SYSTEMS REPRESENT POTENTIAL BASTION FOR HABITABLE ENVIRONMENTS, THE WATERSHEDS AND THE CRUST FROM WHICH THEY ARE DERIVED WARRANT FURTHER GEOLOGICAL AND COMPOSITIONAL CHARACTERIZATION.",,,,,,,,,,,,

THIS PROJECT IS STRUCTURED AROUND THREE CENTRAL OBJECTIVES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE ORIGIN OF THE LUNAR LIGHT PLAINS: (1) DETERMINE THE DISTRIBUTION OF LIGHT PLAINS BY CREATING A GLOBAL MAP OF THESE DEPOSITS USING LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (LRO) IMAGES AND TOPOGRAPHIC DATA, (2) TEST FORMATION HYPOTHESES BY EXAMINING MORPHOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS AND DISTRIBUTION RELATIVE TO LARGE BASINS, AND (3) DETERMINE RELATIVE AGES USING CROSS-CUTTING AND SUPERPOSITION RELATIONSHIPS AND ESTIMATE ABSOLUTE AGES FROM CRATER MEASUREMENTS. EACH OBJECTIVE UTILIZES TECHNIQUES THAT HAVE BEEN TESTED IN AN INITIAL STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE PRINCIPLE INVESTIGATOR AND GRADUATE STUDENT INVESTIGATOR. TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVE #1, THE MOON WILL BE DIVIDED INTO 12 TILES, EACH ENCOMPASSING #tilde#3 MILLION KM2. THE NEARSIDE MARIA WILL BE EXCLUDED FROM THE TILES USING THE AVAILABLE LRO MARE SHAPEFILE. THE LIGHT PLAINS WILL BE MAPPED TILE-BY-TILE WITH ARCGIS MAPPING SOFTWARE USING IMAGES FROM THE LRO WIDE ANGLE CAMERA (WAC) AS WELL AS A MAP OF THE STANDARD DEVIATION OF SLOPE DERIVED FROM THE GLOBAL LUNAR DIGITAL TERRAIN MODEL (GLD 100), WHICH IS USED AS A PROXY FOR ROUGHNESS. THE AVERAGE ELEVATIONS OF INDIVIDUAL LIGHT PLAINS DEPOSITS WILL BE MEASURED FROM THE GLD 100 AND ASSESSED RELATIVE TO THE RANGE OF ELEVATIONS OF THE MARIA TO DETERMINE IF THE LIGHT PLAINS ARE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS A LARGE RANGE OF ELEVATIONS, AS WE WOULD EXPECT IF THEY ARE IMPACT EJECTA, OR A NARROW RANGE, WHICH WOULD FAVOR A VOLCANIC ORIGIN LIKE THE MARIA. TO ADDRESS OBJECTIVE #2, IMAGES FROM BOTH THE LRO WAC AND NARROW ANGLE CAMERA (NAC) WILL BE EXAMINED TO IDENTIFY MORPHOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE LIGHT PLAINS AND LARGE LUNAR BASINS. USING EXISTING TOOLS WITHIN THE ARCGIS SOFTWARE PACKAGE, THE DISTRIBUTION OF LIGHT PLAINS WITH RESPECT TO INDIVIDUAL BASINS WILL BE ASSESSED BY DETERMINING HOW THE SURFACE COVERAGE OF LIGHT PLAINS VARIES WITH INCREASING DISTANCE FROM THE BASIN RIM. IF THE AREAL ABUNDANCE OF LIGHT PLAINS GRADUALLY DECREASES WITH INCREASING DISTANCE FROM THE BASIN RIM, THEN THE LIGHT PLAINS IN THE AREA BEING ASSESSED LIKELY ORIGINATED WITH THE FORMATION OF THAT BASIN. OBJECTIVE #3 WILL BE ADDRESSED BY EXAMINING BOTH WAC AND NAC IMAGES TO LOOK FOR CROSS-CUTTING AND SUPERPOSITION RELATIONSHIPS. USING THESE RELATIONSHIPS, WE WILL DETERMINE WHEN THE LIGHT PLAINS WERE DEPOSITED ON THE SURFACE. TO FURTHER CONSTRAIN THE AGE OF THE DEPOSITS, CRATER MEASUREMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED ON REPRESENTATIVE AREAS USING BOTH WAC AND NAC IMAGES. THE LUNAR CHRONOLOGY AND PRODUCTION FUNCTIONS OF NEUKUM ET AL. (2001) WILL BE APPLIED TO THE RESULTING DATASET TO CALCULATE THE ABSOLUTE MODEL AGES FOR THE LIGHT PLAINS. THESE AGES WILL THEN BE COMPARED TO BOTH FEATURES OF KNOWN AGES AND ABSOLUTE AGE ESTIMATES FOR FEATURES FOR WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE SAMPLES. IF WE FIND THAT THE MAJORITY OF LIGHT PLAINS CAN BE RELATED TO THE FORMATION OF LARGE BASINS, THEN WE WILL HAVE GAINED INSIGHT INTO THE DEGREE TO WHICH LARGE BASINS MODIFY THE SURFACE OF THE MOON, WHICH MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR OTHER PLANETARY BODIES.  IF WE FIND THAT THE LIGHT PLAINS CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY RELATIONSHIPS TO LARGE BASINS, THEN WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBILITY OF A VOLCANIC ORIGIN WITH OTHER PERTINENT DATASETS, SUCH AS COMPOSITIONAL DATA. IN THIS CASE, WE WILL HAVE IDENTIFIED A PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN STYLE OF VOLCANISM ON THE MOON. BOTH OF THESE OUTCOMES DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THIS NESSF SOLICITATION AND NASA S INTERESTS AS STATED UNDER THE PLANETARY SCIENCE RESEARCH PROGRAM AND THE VISIONS AND VOYAGES FOR PLANETARY SCIENCE IN THE DECADE 2013-2022 RESPECTIVELY: HOW HAVE THE MYRIAD CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROCESSES THAT SHAPED THE SOLAR SYSTEM OPERATED, INTERACTED, AND EVOLVED OVER TIME?

REALIZING THIS GOAL REQUIRES THE PRECISE AND ACCURATE DATING OF IMPACT EVENTS RECORDED IN LUNAR IMPACT ROCKS (IMPACTITES).  SAMPLES RETURNED FROM THE DESCARTES MOUNTAINS AND CAYLEY PLAINS FORMATIONS AT THE APOLLO 16 LANDING SITE CONTAIN ABUNDANT IMPACT MELTS THAT REPRESENT FOUR MAJOR COMPOSITIONAL GROUPS, AND EXHIBIT CONVENTIONAL 40AR/39AR AGES THAT SPAN NEARLY 400 MILLION YEARS AND LIKELY REFLECT MULTIPLE IMPACT EVENTS.  PREVIOUS RESEARCHERS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CONSTRAIN THE FORMATION AGES FOR THE NECTARIS AND IMBRIUM BASINS BY ANALYZING APOLLO 16 IMPACTITES, BUT THE GENETIC RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DATED SAMPLES AND A PARTICULAR BASIN ARE UNCERTAIN AT BEST.  THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO THE UNKNOWN AND UNDOUBTEDLY MIXED PROVENANCE OF IMPACT BRECCIA MATERIALS IN THE DESCARTES MOUNTAINS AND CAYLEY PLAINS FORMATIONS, WHICH WERE PRESUMABLY EMPLACED AS EJECTA FROM THE NECTARIS AND IMBRIUM BASINS, RESPECTIVELY.  SINCE THE ORIGIN OF ANY PARTICULAR DATED SPECIMEN IS UNCLEAR, IT SEEMS ADVANTAGEOUS TO ACQUIRE PRECISE AND ACCURATE DATES FOR ALL EVENTS RECORDED IN APOLLO 16 IMPACTITES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEX IMPACT HISTORY PRESERVED IN THE DESCARTES-CAYLEY PLAINS REGION.  THIS REQUIRES NUMEROUS ANALYSES OF A VARIETY OF IMPACT MELTS FROM THE APOLLO 16 SAMPLE SUITE, AS WELL AS A STATISTICAL TREATMENT OF THE RESULTANT DATASET TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER AND TIMING OF IMPACT EVENTS.  WE WILL APPLY HIGH SPATIAL-RESOLUTION LASER MICROPROBE TECHNIQUES TO ACQUIRE MULTIPLE IN SITU 40AR/39AR DATES FROM THIN SECTIONS OF EACH OF SIX IMPACTITES FROM THE APOLLO 16 SAMPLE SUITE THAT ARE KNOWN TO REPRESENT ALL FOUR MAJOR IMPACT MELT COMPOSITIONAL GROUPS.  AN IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE OF THIS APPROACH IS THAT THE PETROGRAPHIC CONTEXT OF THE DATED MATERIAL IS PRESERVED, HELPING TO INFORM AGE INTERPRETATIONS.

TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS, WE PROPOSE TO: 1. MODEL THE TYPES OF FLUID FLOW ON SMALL BODIES: (A) QUANTIFY CONVECTION-DRIVEN HYDROTHERMAL CIRCULATION THROUGH A PERMEABLE CORE, CRACKED FROM THERMAL CONTRACTION; AND (B) ANALYTICALLY DETERMINE THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO INITIATE CRYOVOLCANISM. 2.

This expansion of existing the Earth Camp program is a  partnership between the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, the Planetary Science Institute and Arizona Project WET at the Water Resources Research Center, University of Arizona. Teens and teachers who participate in Earth Camp programs are immersed in the study of water resources on a Powers of 10"" framework, from the smallest scale properties of the water molecule, to intermediate scales of water in desert ecosystems, to the global scale of climate change and predicted impacts on the water cycle. Together, teen and teacher participants will apply their knowledge and communicate their results through interactive displays: The Power of Perspective, using NASA satellite images and data to illustrate regional changes to the water-energy-climate system. Using snapshots of the global view enjoyed by Laurel Clark, they will learn and teach about the connections between their lives and the changing Earth System. The Earth Camp Experience offers a progression of learning from the concrete to the abstract that recognizes that education is a process of preparing learners for the future and helping them engage in meaningful work as well as lifelong pursuits of value. Informal learning opportunities afford the time and space for students to assess the efficacy of their efforts, interpret and evaluate data, re-examine beliefs and understandings, develop their own scientific inquiry via data collection and analysis, apply their learning through action and communicate their findings. This STEM experience will include authentic field and laboratory studies, engaging activities that employ multiple learning modalities, collaborative group work, mathematical thinking skills that contribute to problem solving, applied learning opportunities, and systems thinking that undergirds the creation of solutions. Collaborative learning groups of teens and teachers will immerse themselves in the NASA Earth Science focus areas of Water and Energy Cycles and Climate Variability and Change. Together the teens and teachers will engage in intergenerational problem solving, informal teaching through exhibits, and community education projects. The Earth Camp Experience is composed of six elements: Workshops for Informal Science Educators, Summer Earth Camp Programs for Teens, Teacher Earth Camp, Exhibit Design Workshop (with traveling poster and on-line exhibits) and Earth Clubs at Schools, all coming together to create a cohort of Earth Stewards dedicated to education and informed environmental decision-making. The Earth Camp Experience will support NASA's Education Strategy and Framework by: 1. Strengthening the pipeline to the STEM workforce: Earth Camp serves middle and high school students, about 40% of whom come from backgrounds underrepresented in STEM disciplines. With NASA funding, we will be able to recruit additional students from underrepresented groups, with a goal of 75% underrepresented students. The new track for middle and high school teachers will also greatly expand the impact of the existing Earth Camp program. 2. Engaging Americans in NASA's mission: The Power of Perspective interactive display and exhibit will be displayed at the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum (ASDM: 450,000 visitors/year), on the ASDM website (1 million unique visitors/year), on the Arizona Project WET web site to reach teachers, and at community sites throughout the region.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

It further proposes to greatly augment previous capabilities with major new multi-media platforms developments and maintenance service schedules. Importantly, ASRL also proposes to extend its role of computer support to managing a major portion of the magazines editorial content and development. This will include oversight and management of contract and freelance contributions to the general website from; core content and editorial staff, stringer writers, and project evaluator. It will also build and support new interactive social media platforms such as blogs, quizzes, and more. ASRL has the past proven experience and known leadership skills to manage the necessary complexities of interface between technical and content personnel including; programmers, web designers, staff writers, free-lance writers, and manager for technical content.

The vision of delivering solar power to Earth from platforms in space has been known for decades. However, early SPS architectures were technically complex and unlikely to prove economically viable. There were several reasons: low technology maturity; excessive mass, due in part to the need for huge, high-voltage power management and distribution; the cost of developing a monolithic SPS much larger than the International Space Station (ISS); the need for 100s of astronauts and 1000s of robots for SPS construction in space factories at various orbits, and others. Some of these early issues, particularly regarding technical feasibility, were addressed by NASA's space solar power (SSP) studies and technology research in the mid-to-late 1990s. However, ten years ago a number of key technical and economic uncertainties remained. The concept proposed here - SPS-ALPHA - is fundamentally different from both current satellites and past SPS concepts in several critical ways. SPS-ALPHA is a biologically inspired concept: in a manner analogous to a hive of bees, a large number of individual modules (each individually intelligent"") will physically assemble to form a single enormous satellite. It involves several system segments: (1) an approximately one kilometer diameter RF aperture composed of tens of 1,000s of modular elements (none more than150 kg in mass), each incorporating locally powered and controlled WPT elements; (2) a large, non-rotating structural framework connected to the WPT array; and, (3) numerous autonomously pointing thin-film reflectors, attached to the structural framework, which redirect and concentrate incoming sunlight onto the RF aperture. To deliver energy to Earth, SPS-ALPHA would typically be based in a geostationary Earth orbit (GEO), where it would intercept sunlight using an collection of individual thin-film mirrors, convert that sunlight across a large RF aperture into a coherent microwave beam and transmit it to targets on Earth. SPS-ALPHA might also be based in Earth orbit, or elsewhere, such as at Earth-Moon Libration points, Lunar orbit, Sun-Earth Libration points, Mars orbit, and would deliver abundant and affordable solar power to markets on Earth or to enable ambitious new missions of space exploration and development. This project will establish the technical and economic viability of the SPS-ALPHA concept to an early TRL 3 ""analytical proof-of-concept"" and provide a framework for further study and technology development. The objectives of this innovative advanced concept project are to: (1) conduct an initial end-to-end systems analysis of the SPS-ALPHA concept in order to determine its technical feasibility; (2) identify and assess in greater detail the key technology challenges inherent in the architecture (including figures of merit for each critical technology area); (3) conduct an initial evaluation of the economic viability of the concept (as a function of key performance parameters); and, (4) define a preliminary roadmap for the further research and development of the SPS-ALPHA concept.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose to do this by reproducing spacecraft observations with a three-dimensional numerical model. We specifically propose to address the importance of subsurface water reservoirs (compared to the seasonal and north residual caps), cloud processes, and atmospheric transport. Using a range of physical process parameterizations and an ensemble of model dynamical cores, it is our objective to explore, understand, and remove some of the model-to-model uncertainty inherent in water cycle studies to date. This project is of significance to the planetary atmospheres program because it addresses one of the most important questions in Martian (climate) science: how is the abundance of water on Mars controlled? We seek to further address the followina auestions:how much of the current uncertainty is due to the representation of transport and dynamics?""; ""how important is the regolith water reservoir on diurnal and seasonal time scales?""; ""how important are cloud-radiative-dynamical interactions for the water cycle?""; ""what scope is there for interannual variations in the water cycle given observed variability in atmospheric dust (in southern spring and summer) and surface albedo?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,

The project has three parts - to study: 1. the circulation in the middle atmosphere, specifically the mechanisms that produce the observed thermal and wind structure, including dependence on angular momentum conservation and radiative-dynamical feedbacks involving haze particles; 2. the near-surface circulation and the relationship of winds to observed Aeolian features; and, 3. the large-scale methane cycle, specifically the processes controlling evaporation and precipitation and the relationship to the distribution of surface fluvial features. All three components are fundamentally linked by the general circulation. The project will take advantage of the Titan Weather Research and Forecasting model, developed jointly via prior OPR funding, the NASA AISR program, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. A major thrust of this project will be the use of new data constraints from Cassini, the most striking of which are RADAR observations of features interpreted to be dunes and fluvial landforms. Analysis of data with prognostic numerical models, using simplified conceptual models to interpret both the data and modeling, are key to quantitative progress in understanding the atmospheric circulation on Titan. Titan is a highly significant object in the solar system because it is one of the few terrestrial bodies to possess an active climate system, of which the circulation and methane cycles"" are critically important components. By studying this system, the proposed project addresses NASA strategic goal 3C (advance scientific knowledge of the solar system), and addresses the objectives of the OPR program by enhancing the scientific return from (primarily) the Cassini mission, improving our understanding of how Titan has evolved over time, and defining dynamical processes operating within Titan's atmosphere.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

We will use theories of dune formation to predict bedform orientations based on modeled winds at different resolutions, dust loadings and orbital configurations, and compare these and other predicted dune properties with observations of active and inactive dune fields on Mars.  Dunes haves been observed on Mars since the Mariner 9 mission in the early 1970s. In the last few years, high-resolution imaging by instruments such as THEMIS and HiRISE have provided unprecendented detail of dunes and dunefields. As dunes are aeolian (wind-driven) features, they provide a means to access the near-surface circulation, which has only been measured at a handful of locations on Mars, and for a complete annual cycle at only two locations (the Viking Lander 1 and 2 sites). The mere existence of dunes implies winds that are strong enough to transport sediment, their morphology (the dune type) indicates the directional variability of the wind regime, and their orientations provide information about the long-term wind direction. The bedform orientation of most dune types does not uniquely imply the dominant or average wind direction, however we will use an approach that is novel for Mars and will predict dune orientations given our modeled long-term wind field, using the gross bedform-normal transport (GBNT) approach of Rubin and Hunter [1987]. By comparing predicted and observed orientation, we can thus assess the validity of our model winds. We will use global and mesoscale numerical models of the Martian atmosphere, for a range of dust loadings during the storm season, and for a range of orbital configurations, to produce predictions of sand flux, DCA and dune orientations (applying the GBNT approach to the annual cycle of wind data) for the entire planet at low resolution and for four selected study regions at high resolution.  These will be compared to observations of respectively dune locations, DCA and slipface orientations (or other measures of dune orientation). If they agree, we can have more confidence in the validity of our modeled wind field for present day Mars. Given the important role of local scale topography we expect disagreement in many regions when using only the global model, and will use the mesoscale model to assess whether a finer resolution allows us to capture the dune-forming flows. Another reason for disagreement would be an incorrect choice of saltation threshold, and by tuning this to better match the observations we will obtain estimates of the saltation threshold on Mars itself. A third reason would be a strong dependence of the dune-forming winds on dust loading during the storm season, so we will also produce results for different dust storm conditions. A fourth reason would be a strong dependence of the dune-forming winds on Mars's orbital configuration, particularly with dunes judged to be inactive in the present wind regime, so we will also produce results for different obliquities and timing of perihelion. By performing the proposed work we will thus (1) produce estimates of the saltation threshold on Mars, (2) examine the importance of using the gross bedform-normal transport (GBNT) approach over a full annual cycle to predict dune orientations, and compare this with the previous method of inferring dominant winds based on certain dune morphologies and bedform orientations, (3) assess the validity of our modeled wind fields on global and regional scales, and (4) examine the impact of changes in (a) dust loading and (b) Mars's orbital configuration on the dune-forming circulation.  This proposal addresses NASA Strategic Goal 3, specifically, 3C. The proposal is highly relevant to the MFRP program, as by investigating the coupled atmospheric and geological systems on Mars we will address Mars Exploration Program goals 2A, 2B and 3A.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of models to reproduce the superrotation observed in Titan's atmosphere has been the center of some controversy with the modeling community as early good predictions of the circulation by the LMD model (a model which is no longer available) were found not to be reproducible by any later model. Most recently, our TitanWRF model has been proven able to reproduce the superrotation and it was found that very low diffusivity within the dynamical core (numerical or imposed) was the crucial factor. A functioning model of the observed superrotation finally opens up the possibility of exploring the mechanisms behind both the superrotation and the atmospheric circulation in general. Titan is an interesting member of the terrestrial atmospheres"" set (Venus, Earth, Mars, and Titan) since it is in the ""slow rotation"" regime along with Venus, but is forced with a seasonal cycle of Earth and Mars-like extremes.  We propose a comprehensive study of the circulation, with a specific focus on momentum and energy transport mechanisms.  The observation of clouds, apparently rain / runoff carved channels, and lakes makes methane a central issue for Titan. Lacking oceans, Titan's ""hydrological"" cycle is composed of transports between the subsurface, lakes, and the atmosphere - involving all three phases of methane. Several models have now been used to assemble a basic picture of the methane cycle, involving drying of the tropics, rainfall in association with a near pole-to-pole sweep of the ITCZ, and a bias in the surface stability of liquid methane that appears similar in both sense and mechanism to the stability of surface water ice on Mars. Currently, only simplified 3D models have been used to examine the methane cycle on Titan - here we propose to bring a full General Circulation Model (GCM) to bear on the problem.  In this project, we propose to use GCM modeling to address problems in the Titan atmosphere and climate system. The models are  based on two open source codes: the NCAR WRF and the MITGCM.  The proposed work is relevant to the OPR program through its study of Titan's atmosphere and climate system - a significant target of study for Cassini and the sole target of the Huygens missions. As a complex body with a rare ""Earth-like"" atmosphere and climate system, Titan is an especially important focus for attention within outer planets research.

The purpose of the support is to convene interdisciplinary meetings in global environmental change and Earth systems science each summer, to report back to NASA and other supporting agencies, and to seek publication of the findings of the sessions in scientific journals or other outlets. Conceived in 1989 and conducted each year since 1990, the AGCI summer meetings are designed to further knowledge in global change science by convening interdisciplinary scholars with the coordination and direction of session chairs, to focus on specific topics in the social and natural sciences (see section 4.2 and  ww.agci.org/meetings.html). These meetings consistently fill a unique niche by fostering a strong dialogue across the disciplines and often between the social and natural sciences. The session themes are selected to reflect research priorities as expressed by individual federal agencies and broadly as outlined each year in the United States Climate Change Science Program's five goals and linked set of research focus areas described in Our Changing Plane 2007 and generally in the CCSP Strategic Plan. AGCI topic selections also reflect the ongoing activities of the International Panel on Climate Change and the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme research areas of interest. The generation of potential session topics by participants each summer are reviewed by AGel's Science Advisory Board for consideration based on their ability to further global change science and the contribution this can make to society. The support requested is to provide the necessary resources to plan, conduct, document and report on two week long meetings each year beginning in 2007 and concluding in 2009. Approximately 57 scientists will participate for a total of 342 participant days in 2007 and 54 scientists for a total of 648 participant days in the years 2008 and 2009 for a total of 990 participant days. It is anticipated that each session will include international participants (past sessions average about 17 percent). In addition to the enrichment received by each participant regarding topics within their field, they are exposed to new information, often from outside their discipline. Taking advantage of the longer than usual format for a scientific meeting, participants have the opportunity to engage in extended and meaningful dialogue and follow-up with newfound colleagues in greater depth than is often the case in shorter duration meetings. One significant outcome of this approach is that research collaborations are spawned across disciplines that may not have occurred otherwise. Based on statements made by participants concerning the value of this type of meeting, a key element is that they are stimulated to? bring fresh approaches to their own research based on new insights developed at the AGCI summer meetings. Research recommendations that are developed at the meetings also playa role in the generation of research priorities at the agency level. As part of each interdisciplinary summer session one of the participants is asked to give the Walter Orr Roberts Memorial Public Lecture providing an education and public outreach opportunity aimed at a general audience on current topics in global environmental change. These lectures are broadcast on the local television station and videos are made available to the public. It is the intention of AGCI to continue seeking support for the summer meetings from agencies in addition to NASA and from the private sector and international sources. To date, complimentary support for the NASA sponsored meetings has come from the EPA, NSF, NOAA, USDA/FS, DOE and interagency support of the Sub-committee on Global Change Research, the United Nations En",,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose to investigate the relationship between galaxies and the IGM by obtaining deep GALEX NUV and FUV images of the fields surrounding sight lines with well-studied 0 VI and Lya absorption-line systems. With these data we will: (1) Derive the UV colors and the star-formation rates and surface densities of galaxies at the redshifts of the absorption-line systems. (2) Correlate these quantities with the absorber properties (hot gas content, metal content, line widths) and sight line impact parameters. We will use the rest-frame ultraviolet bands to provide information about star-formation together with ground-based optical images to gain a representative view of the entire stellar population (including stellar mass) for galaxies with a wide range of masses and structures. (3) Compare the starformation results with galaxy morphology as derived from both ground-based images and archival HST/WFPC2 data. The HST data cover only a small fraction of the QSO fields seen by GALEX but nonetheless encompass many galaxies at the redshifts of the absorbers (see Fig. 1). We will propose for additional HST observing time should GALEX time be awarded. (4) Identify faint blue galaxies, tidally stripped regions, and galactic halos/winds of large galaxies for follow-up spectroscopy with large ground-based telescopes and high-resolution imaging with HST/WFC3. Our analysis will reveal whether the absorption features identified with WHIM gas occur preferentially near high surface brightness star-forming galaxies (bluer colors, strong optical emission lines), in extended low surface brightness regions with young stars (e.g., tidal tails), or in concentrations of early-type galaxies (redder colors, bulge-dominated), which would favor a virialized group or cluster location. Lack of correlation with galaxies would argue for a low-density WHIM location.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Our primary objective is to produce astronomical-grade light curves for individual stars or ensembles of stars that will complement the detrended light curves produced by the Kepler data pipeline. Relying upon the planned calibration efforts of the Kepler Science Team, we will investigate the possibility of producing contiguous light curves which extend the planned current monthly time base differential light curves to at least a quarterly basis and possibly a time base covering the entire 3.5 year lifetime of the Kepler primary mission. This extended time base capability will support Kepler mission efforts to characterize the nature of the host stars of detected planetary candidates; in particular we will be able to gain better insight to the nature of brightness fluctuations over days to months which might be caused by chromospheric activity due to decades-long activity cycles of stars like the Sun. This calibration effort will place stars with detected transits in the context of the much larger sample of stars lacking transits. Our efforts will extend planned Kepler calibration efforts by analyzing 310 variable stars with known periods, 2 cataclysmic variables, and 32 bright hot stars during the first year of the mission. Nearly all of the variables are reserved Kepler Key Project targets (309 out of 312) but they have brightness fluctuations that exceed one percent in the V band; the remaining 35 stars are not reserved targets. Some of our proposed targets may be requested by other Guest Observer proposals; in that case, we will relinquish those duplicate targets from our target list during the proprietary period.",,,,,,,,,,,,

They demonstrated that the precision of *aperture photometry* of bright isolated stars -- corrected with the new 2-dimensional aperture-flux correction function -- can yield photometry that is almost as precise as that produced by PSF-fitting stellar photometry. They found that the difference between the intensity-weighted mean centroid of stellar IRAC Ch1 images and the true centroid of the PSF contains a *systematic astrometric error* which may be a significant fraction of the undersampled IRAC Ch1 pixel. The distance measured between two point sources on any given IRAC Ch1 BCD image may be systematically off by as much as 0.2 pixels which is 0.24 arcsec on the sky. The PI proposes to analyze archival stellar observations obtained with IRAC Ch1 and Ch2 with the goal of developing new calibration procedures that have the potential of significantly improving the precision of point-source photometry and astrometry of IRAC BCD images. The new calibration procedures will be tested by analyzing thousands of IRAC archival observations of transiting extrasolar planets. A new standalone IRAC aperture photometry and astromery code, called IRACaphot, will be written in C and will implement these new calibration procedures. A user-friendly graphical interface to IRACaphot (based on IDL) will be developed to allow general IRAC Ch1 and Ch2 observers to easily achieve better stellar photometry and astrometry with IRAC BCD images. This timely research effort is intended to enhance the science return not only of existing IRAC Ch1 and Ch2 observations in the Spitzer data archive but also those that will be made during Spitzer's upcoming Warm Mission.",,,,,,,,,,,,

As shown by helioseismic studies, the zonal and the meridional flow in the upper convection zone vary with the solar cycle. The variation of these flows associated with the new cycle has been detected before any magnetic activity of cycle 24 was present on the surface of the sun. The high-resolution observations available from SDO/HMI allow us to measure these large-scale flows at a great distance from disk center. Sub-surface flows derived from previous observations have been limited to about 60 degrees latitude, while they can be measured to at least 75 degrees using SDO, which is a substantial improvement. For the meridional flow, we will address the question whether there are multiple cells per hemisphere, which is of great importance for flux-transport dynamos. Second, we propose to derive the variation with depth in order to validate hints of multiple cells in depth. For the zonal flow and its cycle variation, we will focus on the poleward branch of this pattern in addition to the equatorward one. The cycle variations of the zonal and the meridional flow are usually studied separately. We propose to treat both flow components as part of a single system. How are these flow variations related to each other? Is their timing the same with regard to the activity cycle? We plan to pursue the proposed goals with multiple techniques and data sets. Local and global helioseismic techniques will be applied to HMI Dopplergrams. The ring-diagram analysis will be used to derive subsurface flows in the upper shear layer of the convection zone, while the time-distance analysis will be used to derive the meridional flow in the deeper convection zone. Global helioseismology will be used to derive the zonal flow throughout the whole  convection zone. Comparing zonal flows derived from global as well as local techniques allows us to cross-validate the results.",,,,,,,,,,,,

THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL PROVIDE AN INCREASED UNDERSTANDING OF THE EVOLUTION AND OBSERVED PROPERTIES OF PLANETARY SYSTEMS. THE PROJECTS ARE ENUMERATED BELOW. 1) OUR RECENT MIGRATION SIMULATIONS OF A SATURN MASS PLANET EMBEDDED IN A RELAXED DISK (DISK WHOSE GAP IS CLEARED TO A STEADY STATE GAP BEFORE PLANET RELEASE) DID NOT REVEAL FAST MIGRATION. WE PROPOSE TO EXTEND THESE CALCULATIONS BY INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF MASS ACCRETION ON THE PLANET MASS, STARTING WITH A SMALL MASS PLANET. WE WILL DETERMINE WHETHER FAST MIGRATION SETS IN DURING THE EVOLUTION. 2) OUR RECENT MIGRATION SIMULATIONS OF A SATURN MASS PLANET EMBEDDED IN AN UN RELAXED DISK (DISK WHOSE GAP IS NOT CLEARED TO A STEADY STATE GAP BEFORE PLANET RELEASE) DID SOMETIMES REVEAL FAST MIGRATION. WE WILL EXPLORE THE NATURE OF THE DISK FLOW AND DETERMINE THE ORIGIN OF THE STRONG TORQUE ON THE PLANET. 3) WE RECENTLY DEVELOPED AN ANALYTIC THEORY OF NONCOORBITAL COROTATIONAL RESONANCES FOR A MOVING PLANET. WE PROPOSE TO TEST OUR THEORY BY MEANS OF NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS AND EXAMINE REGIMES THAT ARE NOT TREATED BY THE THEORY. 4) WE RECENTLY DEVELOPED AN ANALYTIC MODEL OF THE COORBITAL REGION FOR A MOVING PLANET. WE WILL TEST THE MODEL AND DETERMINE BY MEANS OF NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS WHETHER IT DESCRIBES FAST MIGRATION. 5) WE HAVE BEGUN SIMULATING PLANET MIGRATION IN DECRETION DISKS WHICH CAN CAUSE OUTWARD MIGRATION. WE PROPOSE TO EXPLORE THE SITUATIONS IN WHICH OUTWARD MIGRATION OF A PLANET CAN OCCUR WHERE A CENTRAL TORQUE IS PROVIDED BY A BINARY STAR SYSTEM OR A STAR-INNER PLANET SYSTEM. 6) OUR RECENT SIMULATIONS SHOW THAT THE RATE OF PLANET MIGRATION IS SENSITIVE TO ITS ORBITAL ECCENTRICITY AND CAN REVERSE (BE DIRECTED OUTWARD) IF THE ECCENTRICITY IS GREATER THAN A FEW TENTHS. WE AIM TO DETERMINE THE NATURE OF THE TORQUE BY NUMERICAL AND ANALYTIC MEANS. 7) OUR RECENT SIMULATIONS SHOW THAT PLANETS OF A JUPITER MASS AND GREATER CAN ACQUIRE AN ECCENTRICITY OF ABOUT 0.1 IN A FEW THOUSAND ORBITS, AS A RESULT OF DISK INTERACTIONS. WE WILL EXPLORE PARAMETER SPACE MORE BROADLY AND DETERMINE WHETHER ECCENTRICITIES AS LARGE AS 0.4 (FREQUENTLY FOUND BSERVATIONALLY) CAN OCCUR IN LONGER SIMULATIONS.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Our approach will address how to optimize scheduling given a set of competing global objectives for a mission as well as a large set of operational and scientific constraints. We will initially focus on James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as it is under development and is representative of a broad class of science scheduling problems. We will also consider the requirements of the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) to ensure and validate the generality of our approach. Multi-objective means retaining and exploiting information about multiple, often competing objectives, during schedule optimization. This is in contrast to optimization techniques that require the consolidation of all objectives into a single quantity to be optimized. Consolidation necessarily implies committing in advance to the relative importance of different objectives, and hides information that can be used to make scheduling more effective. Multi-participant means arcbitecting and designing the system to allow multiple users to work with the system at one time, generally in collaborative ways, but possibly independently. This is in contrast to approaches based on a single central scheduling process. By incorporating both of these capabilities into a single framework we gain more than we would from either one separately. This is because it is frequently the case that competing objectives arise directly from the various participants, and balancing these objectives requires the participants to cooperate and compromise. This work will advance the state of the art for observatory scheduling in three ways: (I) by providing simulation and trade study capabilities that will facilitate key early design choices; (2) by scheduling more responsively in reaction to interesting events or system capability changes, and (3) by optimizing competing objectives of the mission so that the overall science schedule is more efficient, and robust. The key elements of our approach are: a) a model-based representation of objectives, constraints, and preferences, which will provide a basis for schedule optimization and for flexible modification as the mission progresses b) an architecture to support multi-participant scheduling with both global and per-participant objectives c) multi-objective optimization algorithms to find and characterize Pareto-optimal solutions d) an experiment plan to systematically investigate and document our results e) the application of our approach to two distinct observatory missions, as a demonstration of its generality and applicability. Our approach will leverage our experience and familiarity with science planning and scheduling in past missions, including HST, Spitzer, Chandra, EUVE, FUSE, etc. from both operational and software perspectives. We will assess and incorporate available tools and approaches, such as existing scheduling modeling languages, algorithms and technologies (e.g. as embodied in Spike, ASPEN, and others), science simulators (e.g. JMS, the JWST Mission Simulator), and user interface elements. We will explicitly consider and design for the future incorporation of constraints, preferences, and objectives not yet defined, by providing component APIs and extension points. Improvements to scheduling applications have a proven track record for increasing science return and lowering operations costs for space missions. For example, scheduling improvements allow the Hubhle Space Telescope to routinely achieve a weekly scheduling efficiency higher than thought possible at launch. Our proposal builds on this work and our success criteria include the deMonstration of a simultaneous up to 20% increase in scheduled science activities for JWST along with a reduction of up to 20% resource consumption that can lead to a prolonged mission lifetime",,,,,,,,,,,,

The International Astronomical Union has proclaimed 2009 the International Year of Astronomy (IYA), in recognition of the continuing legacy of Galileo's initial observations - and the accompanying opportunity to spread interest in astronomy's contributions to science and culture. The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) propose to bring the NASA Science Mission Directorate's (SMD) contributions to the story of astronomical observation and discovery to communities across the nation through an IYA-themed traveling exhibition designed for libraries and the formal and informal science education audiences that they serve. By providing free and convenient access to educational materials and programs, libraries play an important role in nurturing a lifelong journey of discovery for both children and adults. The IYA presents a unique impetus for libraries to incorporate NASA content and expertise into these offerings. STScI and the SAO will develop and disseminate the traveling exhibition in partnership with the American Library Association (ALA). The proposed effort leverages existing STScI, SAO, and ALA expertise, and includes: 1) IYA-themed exhibit panels; 2) accompanying educational resource collections that invite further learning and discovery; 3) coordinated speaking opportunities that connect local scientists - and their stories - to the youth and families in their communities; 4) professional development for librarians and scientists; 5) formative and summative evaluation. As few NASA E/PO programs target libraries, the proposed work will extend NASA SMD resources to new audiences.

SEDNA&#039;S CLOSEST APPROACH AS IT ORBITS THE SUN IS A PERIHELION OF 76 AU, FAR BEYOND THE 30 AU - 50 AU REGION INHABITED BY OVER 1,000 KNOWN KUIPER BELT OBJECTS (KBOS), NEPTUNE AND PLUTO. ITS EXTREME ORBIT IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER BOUND SOLAR SYSTEM OBJECT AS IT TRAVELS FROM 76 AU TO NEARLY 1,000 AU, NEVER VENTURING NEAR THE KUIPER BELT. WE SEEK FUNDING TO DISCOVER MORE SEDNA-LIKE OBJECTS USING GROUND-BASED TELESCOPES IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE BASIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS UNUSUAL POPULATION, WHICH MAY RIVAL THE KBOS IN TOTAL NUMBERS. THE KBOS ARE THOUGHT TO BE THE MOST PRIMITIVE BODIES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM DUE TO THEIR EXTREME DISTANCE. THEY MAY BE REMNANTS FROM THE PLANET FORMING ERA THAT HAVE BEEN STORED IN AN EXTREMELY COLD (&lt;40 KELVIN) ENVIRONMENT SINCE THE PLANET FORMING ERA. ALL KNOWN KBOS TRAVEL CLOSER TO THE SUN THAN ABOUT 50 AU. IT IS THOUGHT THAT SEDNA MAY BE THE FIRST KNOWN AND BEST EXAMPLE OF A TRANSITION CLASS OF OBJECTS BETWEEN THE KBOS AND THE VERY DISTANT OORT CLOUD BODIES AT ROUGHLY 10,000 AU. BECAUSE OF THE OORT CLOUD&#039;S EXTREME DISTANCE (AND THUS, FAINTNESS), IT WILL NOT OBSERVABLE IN OUR LIFETIMES. HOWEVER, ITS PRESENCE IS INFERRED FROM THE LONG-PERIOD COMETS. THUS, BY DISCOVERING MORE SEDNA-LIKE BODIES, WE CAN PUT CONSTRAINTS ON THE OORT CLOUD, AN UNSEEN POPULATION EJECTED FROM THE SOLAR SYSTEM DURING THE PLANET FORMING ERA. SEDNA&#039;S ORBIT MAY PROVIDE US WITH OTHER CLUES TO THE EARLY SOLAR ENVIRONMENT. CURRENT THEORIES SUGGEST THAT SUCH AN EXTREME ORBIT COULD BE PRODUCED BY A CLOSE PASSAGE BETWEEN OUR SUN AND ANOTHER STAR. SUCH AN EVENT COULD ONLY HAPPEN IN THE EARLY SOLAR ENVIRONMENT WHEN THE SUN WAS STILL PRESENT IN ITS BIRTH CLUSTER. THUS, SEDNA&#039;S ORBIT MAY GIVE US CLUES TO THE VERY ANCIENT SOLAR SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT. THE SEARCH FOR OTHER SEDNAS IS DIRECTLY ALIGNED WITH THE FOLLOWING THREE OBJECTIVES OF NASA&#039;S SCIENCE GOALS FOR PLANETARY SCIENCE: 1) INVENTORY SOLAR SYSTEM OBJECTS AND IDENTIFY THE PROCESSES ACTIVE IN AND AMONG THEM CLEARLY, IF THE SEDNA-LIKE BODIES COMPRISE A NEW POPULATION WITHIN THE SOLAR SYSTEM, IT MUST BE INVENTORIED. THIS POSSIBLE TRANSITION POPULATION IS A SET OF OBSERVABLE BODIES BETWEEN TWO DISTINCT POPULATIONS: (A) THE KBOS, WHICH ARE WELL-STUDIED AND (B) THE OORT CLOUD BODIES. 2) UNDERSTAND HOW THE SUN&#039;S FAMILY OF PLANETS, SATELLITES, AND MINOR BODIES ORIGINATED AND EVOLVED A POPULATION OF SEDNAS MAY CONTAIN TRACE INDICATORS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM&#039;S HISTORY SUCH AS CLOSE ENCOUNTERS WITH THE NASCENT SUN&#039;S BIRTH GROUP OF STARS. IN ADDITION, THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SEDNA-LIKE BODIES COULD REPRESENT THE LEAST THERMALLY ALTERED MATERIAL IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 3) UNDERSTAND THE PROCESSES THAT DETERMINE THE HISTORY AND FUTURE OF HABITABILITY OF ENVIRONMENTS ON MARS AND OTHER SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT THE SEDNA POPULATION CONTAINS MARS-SIZED BODIES. A MARS-SIZED BODY AT 400 AU WITH A REFLECTIVITY OF 15% (SIMILAR TO THE KBOS) WOULD HAVE AN APPARENT BRIGHTNESS OF ABOUT R=24 MAGNITUDES, WHICH WOULD BE WELL WITHIN OUR SURVEY DETECTION LIMIT. SUCH A BODY WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO BE FOUND IN PREVIOUS SURVEYS BECAUSE OF THE FAINTNESS OF THE BODY AND ITS EXTREME DISTANCE (I.E. SLOW APPARENT MOTION), OR BOTH. OUR PRIMARY TOOLS FOR THIS SURVEY WILL BE WIDE FIELD 4 TO 10 METER CLASS TELESCOPES. OUR SURVEY WILL BE CONDUCTED IN A MANNER THAT IS SENSITIVE TO THE MOST DISTANT OBJECTS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM, TARGETING BODIES THAT RANGE FROM 60 AU OUT TO 1000 AU. OUR TEAM HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE CONDUCTING SIMILAR SURVEYS TO SUCCESSFULLY SEARCH FOR KUIPER BELT OBJECTS, NEPTUNE TROJANS AND OTHER SMALL BODY POPULATIONS.

Most of the baryonic mass in the universe is contained in the intergalactic gas associated with these structures, not in luminous galaxies or stars. NASA's Science Plan targets this filamentary cosmic web of atomic matter and its impact on star formation and galaxy assembly as a high priority area of research in the next decade. The Ultraviolet Space Observatory (USO) is a medium-class ($600M) mission concept designed to strengthen the foundations of observational cosmology by examining the cosmic web, its interactions with galaxies, and its enrichment with the products of stellar and galactic evolution. USO will perform fundamental tests of cosmological theory and will observe feedback processes occurring in the modern universe during the past 5 billion years at redshifts of z<0.5, for which extensive sky surveys of luminous matter exist or will soon be obtained. Optimized to revolutionize absorption-line spectroscopy in the 100-200 nm wavelength range, USO will determine the baryonic content, ionization, and distribution of the intergalactic medium with sensitivities and cosmic volume grasp orders of magnitude larger than those of previous observatories. Our goal is to exceed the sensitivity of FUSE by 100x and HST by 5x in common spectral regions. Our team of academic, government, and industrial partners will provide a clear articulation of technology investments needed to enable USO in the next decade within a cost-constrained mission envelope. Key focus areas include ultraviolet detector quantum efficiency and format, optimization of optical coatings, grating efficiency and aberration correction, telescope assembly design, and mission operations. Realistic cost estimates will play a central role in all of the technical trades considered. The study results will serve as inputs into NASA's strategic planning process.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

MAST provides public access to 13 missions, three of which (HST, GALEX, and XMM-OM) are actively acquiring new science data, with another, Kepler, scheduled for launch next year. The role of MAST extends beyond the archive basics of providing storage of and user-friendly access to these data. The rapid improvement in interoperability protocols, web services, and information technologies, coupled with the increase in the quantity, quality, and consistency of astronomical data, have largely eliminated the artificial barriers that once partitioned astronomy according to wavelength regimes and techniques. In the past 4 years we have seen many enhancements to interoperability, leading up to the current planned transition to the operational phase of the Virtual Astrophysical Observatory. Our vision is to ensure the continued growth of seamless inter-archive access and collaboration for the scientific benefit of our user community and to maximize the return on the investment made by the U.S. public in our space astrophysics.   The 75 Terabyte MAST data archive is one of the most significant astronomical collections available today. The scientific value of MAST comes from the varied astrophysical phenomena that dominate the optical/UV regions of the electromagnetic spectrum and from the user-friendly implementation of its archive user interfaces. The utility of MAST missions is demonstrated by the publication rate of-875 scientific papers per year that make substantial use of these data. The primary World Wide Web user interface to MAST enables users to search our databases, retrieve data, download mission documentation and analysis software, seek answers to analysis/archive questions, and cross-correlate our holdings with those at other NASA data-centers or with user-provided catalogs. The innovative GALEX science archive interface has many advanced features that allow users to realize the full scientific potential often this unique all-sky survey.   The new Hubble Legacy Archive (HLA) project aims to revolutionize Hubble archival research by creating advanced, science-ready HST data products (stored online for immediate access) with powerful and flexible user interfaces that enable rapid exploration of our archive holdings in the wider context of the Virtual Observatory. The HLA is leading the way toward the next generation of archival interfaces and high-level science products for MAST and the Virtual Observatory.",,,,,,,,,,,,

SAGE provides a comprehensive picture of the current star formation activity which is traced by the IRAC and MIPS bands. The SAGE data allow, for the first time, a global study of star formation in the LMC at high enough resolution to resolve individual cores and protostars at a range of mid-IR wavelengths. We will use the deep SAGE JRAC Mosaic Photometry Catalog, MIPS catalogs, and JRAC and MIPS images to create methods for searching and identifying YSOs; methods that can be applied in other galaxies with JWST. Our recent paper reports the discovery of -1000 YSOs in the LMC based on the IRAC and MIPS 24 microns single epoch point source catalogs; a major increase over the 20 previously known YSOs However, because of the selections biases, this study is missing the massive YSOs that may be resolved sources in IRAC or too young to be detected at IRAC bands. It is also missing low-luminosity YSOs because they are confused with the background galaxies in the color magnitude space. Here we propose to fill in these gaps and complete the census of YSOs detected by Spitzer in the LMC. Our proposed work will reveal an additional 10,000-50,000 YSOs in order to construct a substantially more complete list of the YSOs. We will use the new IRAC Mosaic Photometry Catalog to search for low-mass YSOs. This catalog is over 1 mag deeper than single epoch catalogs used by Whitney et al. and will permit detection of low mass YSOs down to 2 solar masses. To search for massive YSOs, we will use IRAC and MIPS 24 microns images to select YSO candidates extended in IRAC. We will perform aperture photometry to obtain fluxes. We will use MIPS 24, 70, and 160 microns Catalogs and images to search for the very youngest YSOs. To lessen contamination by non-YSO sources, we will study the environment of the YSOs by inspecting all available images for each source. We will also use the spectroscopic information available for a subset of YSO candidates from Whitney et al. and other YSO studies to guide our YSO selection. We will fit the spectral-energy distributions (SEDs) of the YSO candidates using the model grid of Robitaille et al. (2006) and derive physical properties for those that are well fitted. The YSO models will be Significantly improved than these used by Whitney et al. The Robitaille et al. (2006) model grid will include YSO cluster models, PAH emission, and accurate disk models for high-mass sources. With these models, we will derive their physical parameters and assign evolutionary stages. The major implication of our study is that with the unbiased list of the YSOs, we will be able to estimate total mass of the YSOs and evolutionary timescales that can be used to estimate the star formation rate (SFR) in the LMC. If successful, this method would provide an independent estimate of star formation throughout the universe! The complete census of the YSOs will also lay groundwork for the protostellar population models, both resolved protostellar photometry, and spectral energy distributions of unresolved protostellar populations. Detailed comparison between the entire population of the YSOs and theoretical models, will motivate development of the YSO models, in terms of pinning down the evolutionary timescales. Our results will inform the models of the unresolved protostellar populations about the YSO components of the synthetic spectra.",,,,,,,,,,,,

While gas lines have been detected in some protoplanetary disks, there has been no systematic extensive search in uniformly processed spectra covering this wide age range. Our study is motivated and supported by a new suite of recently discovered gas lines. We will use: Vibration-rotation bands around 14 micron from acetylene and hydrogen cyanide to probe the warm (approx 500 K) molecular gas in the terrestrial planet-forming region of disks; Emission lines from water (often present beyond 14 micron) to characterize the evolution of water vapor in inner disks; Ionized neon emission at 12.81 micron as a sensitive tracer of dissipating disks. With these, among other well known gas diagnostics, our program will:  - trace the dispersal of gas in the planet-forming region of disks, with important implications for terrestrial and giant planet formation - test if gas and dust evolve on a similar timescale and thus provide insights into the main mechanisms for disk dispersal. The sample we selected is drawn from our Herschel Key Program targets and as such will also have: i) far-infrared gas diagnostics tracing the cold (approx 50 K) gas from which giant planets form and ii) Halpha lines tracing hot (5,000-10,000 K) gas accreting onto the star. By combining these three datasets, we will: - trace the evolution of the gas for a wide range of disk radii, from very close to the star through the terrestrial and out to the giant planet-forming region of disks  - establish whether gas dissipates inside-out as predicted by several models of protoplanetary disk evolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,

At the end of their lives, stars lose mass by producing dust grains and expelling them into the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). But how much dust do the different kinds of evolved stars contribute to the mass budget of their host galaxy, and how is this dust produced? How do the returned amounts of dust from these stars depend upon metallicity? We will answer these questions by studying mass loss from evolved stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; Z#tilde#0.3-0.5 x Zsun) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC; Z#tilde#0.2-0.3xZsun). The LMC and SMC have been extensively surveyed with the Spitzer Space Telescope IRAC and MIPS instruments in the Surveying the Agents of Galaxy Evolution (SAGE) legacy projects. The wealth of infrared photometry from the SAGE surveys enables determination of the dust mass loss from evolved stars to the MCs. We propose to quantify the mass-loss rate from each red supergiant (RSG) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star in the Magellanic Clouds by detailed radiative transfer modeling of its spectral energy distribution (SED; plot of flux versus wavelength). Determining mass-loss rates from such SED-fitting makes use of more data per star than determining mass-loss rates from the stars'' colors or excess fluxes, as other studies have done. By combining the IRAC and MIPS photometry from Spitzer with existing 2MASS and optical photometry, we can construct the SED of each evolved star in the SAGE surveys. Preliminary work modeling the SEDs of 3 AGB stars suggests the oxygen-rich (O-rich) AGB star contribution to the LMC mass budget could be much higher, and the carbon-rich (C-rich) AGB contribution much lower, than expected from determining mass-loss rates (MLRs) from colors or excess fluxes. Our initial grid of #tilde#50,000 SED models for RSGs, O-rich AGB stars and C-rich AGB stars show promising coverage of the SAGE-LMC evolved star sample's color and magnitude range. In this 3 year investigation, we will apply this grid to the SAGE-LMC and SAGE-SMC samples and, as part of the process, continually test and improve our model grid with the feedback. In the first year, we will adapt an existing SED-fitting program used for young stellar objects to quantitatively compare the model SEDs of candidate RSGs, O-rich, C-rich and extreme AGBs to the SAGE-LMC photometry. This comparison will produce the mass-loss rate and luminosity for each evolved star. As part of the SED-fitting process, we will develop a means of distinguishing O-rich dust chemistry from C-rich dust chemistry for the extreme AGB candidates. In the second year, we will derive the mass-loss rates for the SAGE-SMC sample, and in the process improve the model grid to include the lower metallicity of the SMC. In the third year, we propose to conduct studies of the dust composition of RSG and AGB stars by investigating the Spitzer IRS spectral samples. The luminosity and mass-loss rates for several tens of thousands of evolved stars will be used to study the physics of how dust is formed and expelled from these stars. Additionally, over all three years, we would make available on a public website all the model grids used to fit the SEDs of evolved stars in the Magellanic Clouds. Our proposed research to determine the mass-loss from evolved stars in the Magellanic Clouds will lay groundwork for future studies of mass loss in more distant galaxies, using data from future missions like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We will synthesize broadband photometry in all of the bands of past, current, and future NASA missions for each of our models, and this synthetic photometry will also be available on our public website.",,,,,,,,,,,,

These IR mass loss rates will be compared to theoretical predictions and to previous observational determinations. Differences will interpreted in terms of how strongly the winds are clumped, providing important input for resolving the current controversy over the actual and inferred mass loss rates of massive stars.",,,,,,,,,,,,

NRM enables the highest angular resolution science possible given the telescope's diameter and operating wavelength. It also provides precise information on a telescope's optical state. NRM relies on its high quality self-calibration properties and the robustness of interferometric techniques, whereas coronagraphy requires exquisite wavefront quality. Stability during an observation sets fundamental NRM contrast limits. A non-redundant mask was recently added to JWST's Fine Guidance Sensor Tunable Filter Imager (FGS TFJ) instrument, bringing a no-cost, no impact boost in angular resolution that complements JWST's coronagraphs. The JWST NR.1 search space lies between SO and 400 mas at 3.8 to 5 microns, even in the telescope's image quality does not meet requirements. JWST's NRM will produce 10 magnitudes of contrast in a 10 ks exposure on an M=7 star, placing Taurus protoplanets and nearby Jovians younger than 300 Myr within JWST's reach. Future space telescopes can improve vastly on JWST's NRt l by utilizing more refined observing methods, and instrumentation designed to take full advantage of NRM's high dynamic range, high contrast capabilities. The ATLAST 16 m segmented primary design can deliver to 12 magnitudes of contrast between 0.7 to 6 mas at 0.1 microns. On an 8 m telescope at O.t micron NRM resolution is almost ten times better than ALMA's finest resolution. Polarization with space-based NRM opens new vistas of astrophysics in planetary system and star formation as well as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and structure around Galactic Black Hole Candidates, with miUiarsecond resolution at 10 or more magnitudes of photometric dynamic range. Space NRM explores areas inaccessible to both JWST coronagraphs and future 30-m class ground-based telescopes. Ground-based NRM is limited by atmospheric variability. Optimization of space-based NRM requires consideration of flat fielding accuracy, target placement repeatability, charge diffusion, intrapixel sensitivity, image persistence, charge transfer efficiency, guilding, wavefront stability, and pupil wander. We propose to assess NRM limits realistically to understand the science yield and technological utility of NRM in space, and, simultaneously, develop NRM science for planet and star formation and extragalactic science in the UV -NIR, to help steer high resolution space based astronomy in the coming decade.",,,,,,,,,,,,

PRIMITIVE MATERIAL LEFT OVER FROM THE FORMATION OF OUR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM HAS FOR A LONG TIME YIELDED TANTALIZING CLUES TO A HETEROGENOUS NEBULA WITH INTRICATE DYNAMICAL, THERMAL AND CHEMICAL STRUCTURE THAT ULTIMATELY LED TO A GREAT DIVERSITY IN THE PLANETS AND PLANETESIMALS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. THE DISCOVERY OF A RICH CHEMISTRY IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS VIA A FOREST OF STRONG 3-40 MICRON MOLECULAR EMISSION LINES (H2O, OH, CO2, HCN, C2H2,...) ALLOWS US FOR THE FIRST TIME TO INVESTIGATE CHEMICAL DIVERSITY IN OTHER PLANET-FORMING ENVIRONMMENTS (SALYK ET AL. 2008; CARR&amp;NAJITA 2008). FURTHER EFFORTS, SUPPORTED BY THE ORIGINS PROGRAM, HAS ESTABLISHED THAT THIS MOLECULAR FOREST IS SEEN IN THE DISKS SURROUNDING MOST YOUNG SOLAR-TYPE STARS (PONTOPPIDAN ET AL. 2010).  WE PROPOSE A 3-YEAR PROGRAM TO ANALYZE OUR GROWING MULTI-WAVELENGTH DATABASE OF OBSERVATIONS OF WATER, OH AND ORGANIC MOLECULES IN THE SURFACES OF PROTOPLANETARY DISKS. THE DATABASE INCLUDES HIGH (R#tilde#25,000-100,000) AND MEDIUM RESOLUTION (R#tilde#600-3000) 3-200 MICRON SPECTRA FROM A WIDE RANGE OF FACILITIES (KECK-NIRSPEC, VLT-CRIRES, SPITZER-IRS, VLT-VISIR, GEMINI-MICHELLE AND HERSCHEL-PACS). OUR PREVIOUS EFFORTS HAVE FOCUSED ON DEMONSTRATING FEASIBILITY FOR OBSERVING WATER AND OTHER MOLECULES IN PLANET-FORMING REGIONS, BUILDING STATISTICS TO SHOW THAT THE MOLECULAR FOREST IS UBIQUITOUS IN DISKS AROUND LOW-MASS AND SOLAR-TYPE STARS AND TAKING THE FIRST STEPS IN UNDERSTANDING THE IMPLIED CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES. NOW, AS THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP, WE WILL COMBINE MULTI-WAVELENGTH DATA FROM OUR UNIQUE MULTI-WAVELENGTH DATABASE TO MAP THE RADIAL DISTRIBUTION OF, IN PARTICULAR, WATER AND ITS DERIVATIVES.  1)	WE WILL USE BOTH LINE PROFILE INFORMATION FROM THE HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTRA, AS WELL AS LINE STRENGTHS, FROM A COMBINATION OF HIGH AND LOW TEMPERATURE LINES TO CONSTRAIN THE RADIAL ABUNDANCE OF WATER VAPOR IN THE EMITTING SURFACES OF DISKS. DESPITE HIGH WATER ABUNDANCES INSIDE #tilde#1 AU, THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE DISK SURFACES ARE STRONGLY DEPLETED IN WATER BOTH FROM THE GAS AND ICE PHASES, BY AS MUCH AS 6 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE, BEYOND 1-2 AU. THIS MAY BE DUE TO THE SETTLING OF ICY GRAINS AS PART OF THE FORMATION OF ICY  PLANETESIMALS (MEIJERINK ET AL. 2009; BERGIN ET AL. 2010). WE WISH TO QUANTIFY THE DEPLETION FACTOR AND ESTABLISH WHETHER THIS IS A COMMON PROPERTY OF ALL PROTOPLANETARY DISKS.  2)	WE WILL PURSUE CRITICAL NEW DATASETS USING UPCOMING OBSERVATIONAL FACILITIES, INCLUDING SPECTRALLY RESOLVED ROTATIONAL WATER LINES IN THE MID-INFRARED. VLT-VISIR, WITH WHICH WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DETECTED WATER LINES AT HIGH RESOLUTION, IS UNDERGOING A SIGNIFICANT HARDWARE UPGRADE WITH A PLANNED COMMISSIONING AROUND JANUARY 2012. THE UPGRADE INCLUDES A MUCH LARGER AND MORE SENSITIVE DETECTOR BASED ON TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED FOR JWST-MIRI, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE ITS EFFICIENCY BY 1-2 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. ON A LONGER TIME SCALE, SOFIA-EXES, JWST-NIRSPEC AND MIRI WILL BECOME ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR MOVING THIS FIELD FORWARD. PONTOPPIDAN IS A JWST-NIRSPEC INSTRUMENT SCIENTIST AT STSCI.  3)	3) WE WILL SEARCH FOR VARIABILITY OF WATER LINES ON TIME SCALES OF MONTHS AND COMPARE THEM TO VARIATION ALREADY SEEN IN CO GAS TO INVESTIGATE ITS ORIGIN. ONE INTRIGUING POSSIBILITY IS DYNAMICAL INTERACTION WITH PROTOPLANETS.   THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS HIGHLY RELEVANT FOR THE ORIGINS OF SOLAR SYSTEMS PROGRAM AS DESCRIBED IN THE SOLICITATION DOCUMENT. IT FALLS INTO THE CATEGORIES DEALING WITH &quot;OBSERVATIONS RELATED TO UNDERSTANDING THE FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF PLANETARY SYSTEMS&quot; AND &quot;STUDIES OF CHEMICAL PROCESSES RELATED TO THE FORMATION OF PLANETARY SYSTEMS.&quot;",,,,,,,,,,,,

USING THE BROADBAND SPECTRA WE WILL ESTIMATE THE VALUES OF THE PHYSICAL PARAMETERS AND COMPARE THESE AT EARLY AND LATE TIMES. WE WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE ORIGIN OF THE HIGH ENERGY EMISSION IN LAT BURSTS IS INTRINSIC OR EXTRINSIC AND WHETHER IT RESULTS FROM AN EXTRAORDINARY BULK LORENTZ FACTOR.

IN FACT IT NOW APPEARS THAT THE HIGHEST ENERGY PHOTONS FROM THE PROMPT EMISSION MAY BE PRODUCED IN INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE OUTBURST AND AN EXTERNAL MEDIUM MANY PARSECS FROM THE PROGENITOR STAR. BY MODELLING THE EARLY PROMPT EMISSION, MEASURED BY THE FERMI LAT AND GBM WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO PUT CONSTRAINTS ON THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THIS EXTERNAL MEDIUM.  HOWEVER, THE BEHAVIOR OF THE AFTERGLOW, ON TIMESCALES, FROM HOURS TO DAYS TO MONTHS IS ALSO STRONGLY DEPENDENT ON THE EXTERNAL MEDIUM. USING DATA FROM GROUND-BASED OPTICAL AND RADIO TELESCOPES, AS WELL AS FROM SWIFT, CHANDRA AND HST, OUR OBSERVATIONS OF THE AFTERGLOW WILL ALLOW US TO PLACE CONSTRAINTS AND HOPEFULLY MEASURE THE TOTAL ENERGETICS OF THE BURSTS AS WELL AS THE DENSITY OF THE EXTERNAL MEDIUM.  ONE POSSIBILITY IS THAT THE APPARENT GREAT ENERGIES OF THE LAT BURSTS, AS WELL AS THEIR PROLIFIC PRODUCTION OF HIGH-ENERGY PHOTONS, ARE DUE TO AN INTERACTION WITH AN UNUSUALLY TENUOUS MEDIUM. COMPARISON OF THE PROMPT AND AFTERGLOW MODELS WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE IF THIS IS THE CASE. HOWEVER, IF THESE BURSTS ARE NOT FOUND IN UNUSUALLY POOR REGIONS, THEN THESE BURSTS ARE FAR TWO POWERFUL TO BE PRODUCED BY &quot;MAGNETARS&quot; (HIGHLY MAGNETIZED, RAPIDLY ROTATING NEUTRON STARS), AND INSTEAD MUST BE CREATED INSTEAD BY BLACK HOLES WITH MASSES MANY TIMES THAT OF THE SUN.

MEASURING THE ENERGETICS OF OUTFLOWS IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR NASA''S SCIENCE OBJECTIVE OF UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECT OF ENERGETIC PROCESSES AROUND SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLES ON THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT IN GALAXIES, CLUSTERS AND THE INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM. THEREFORE, THE MOST IMPORTANT GOALS IN THE STUDY OF THESE OUTFLOWS ARE TO MEASURE THEIR MASS FLUX, KINETIC LUMINOSITY, AND CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES IN ORDER TO ASSESS THEIR IMPORTANCE TO AGN FEEDBACK ON THEIR ENVIRONMENT. THE BROAD RANGE OF REDSHIFTS AND THE ACCESS TO SHORT REST WAVELENGTHS MADE POSSIBLE BY FAR ULTRAVIOLET SPECTROSCOPIC EXPLORER (FUSE) OBSERVATIONS OF AGN OPENS A VAST DISCOVERY SPACE USING THE MANY MORE DIAGNOSTIC LINES (COMPARED TO LONGER WAVELENGTHS) IN THE 500-1050 A RANGE (REST WAVELENGTHS) THAT SHOW UP AS ABSORPTION TROUGHS IN AGN OUTFLOWS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR THE DENSITY-SENSITIVE EXCITED-STATE TRANSITIONS OF HIGHLY IONIZED ELEMENTS (E.G., OIV* 790) THAT CAN YIELD THE DISTANCE OF THE OUTFLOWS FROM THE CENTRAL SOURCE, AND THE INCREASINGLY HIGHER IONIZATION SPECIES (O VI, NE VIII, NA IX AND MG X) THAT SUPPLY THE CRUCIAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE UV AND XRAY (SO-CALLED WARM ABSORBERS) MANIFESTATION OF AGN OUTFLOWS. OVER THE COURSE OF ITS 10 YEARS OF OPERATION, FUSE OBSERVED NEARLY TWO HUNDRED ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI (AGN) AT REDSHIFTS FROM LESS THAN 0.01 TO NEARLY 3.

OUR PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF THE FUSE ARCHIVE REVEALS DOZENS OF AGN WITH APPROPRIATE CHARACTERISTICS FOR US TO CARRY OUT OUR PROPOSED PROGRAM OF STUDY.

FOR THOSE OBJECTS WITH AVAILABLE X-RAY OBSERVATIONS, WE WILL ALSO USE THOSE DATA TO HELP UNDERSTAND THE FULL RANGE OF IONIZATION STATES IN THE ABSORBING GAS. OUR WORK WILL INVOLVE FIVE STEPS TO OBTAINING REAL MEASUREMENTS OF THE MASS FLUX, KINETIC LUMINOSITY, AND THE ABUNDANCES IN A LARGE SAMPLE OF AGN: 1. WE WILL MEASURING RELIABLE IONIC COLUMN DENSITIES FROM THE OBSERVED ABSORPTION TROUGHS, USING THE HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTRA TO OVERCOME THE EFFECTS OF NON-BLACK SATURATION. 2. WE WILL USE PHOTOIONIZATION MODELS TO MEASURE THE IONIZATION STATE AND TOTAL OUTFLOWING COLUMN DENSITY, FACILITATED BY OUR MEASUREMENTS OF ABSORPTION IN MULTIPLE IONIC STATES IN THE FUSE (AND HST) SPECTRA. 3. WE WILL DETERMINE THE CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES, INCLUDING RELATIVE ABUNDANCES FROM THE PHOTOIONIZATION MODELS, AND ABSOLUTE ABUNDANCES (I.E., RELATIVE TO HYDROGEN) SINCE WITH FUSE (TOGETHER WITH HST WHEN AVAILABLE) WE MEASURE SEVERAL LINES IN THE LYMAN SERIES, ALLOWING FOR AN ACCURATE DETERMINATION OF HI. 4. WE WILL DETERMINE THE DISTANCE OF THE OUTFLOW FROM THE CENTRAL SOURCE BY MEASURING THE NUMBER DENSITY (N_H) VIA TROUGHS FROM METASTABLE LEVELS AND USING THE N_H AND IONIZATION PARAMETER (U) TO SOLVE FOR THE DISTANCE OF THE ABSORBING GAS. 5. WE WILL CONSTRAIN THE FRACTION OF SOLID ANGLE SUBTENDED BY THE OUTFLOW FROM THE CENTRAL CONTINUUM SOURCE BY USING THE FRACTION OF OUTFLOWS DETECTED IN OUR LARGE SAMPLE AS A PROXY FOR THE GLOBAL COVERING FRACTION. AS A PRODUCT OF OUR STUDY, WE WILL OPTIMALLY REPROCESS AND PRODUCE HIGH QUALITY MERGED SPECTRA FOR ALL THE FUSE OBSERVATIONS OF AGN, WHICH WE WILL SUBMIT TO THE MAST ARCHIVE FOR FURTHER USE BY THE ASTRONOMICAL COMMUNITY.

OUR NEW ALGORITHM, WHICH WE NAMED ADAPTIVE COMPENSATION OF APERTURE DISCONTINUITIES (ACAD), PROVIDES THE ABILITY TO COMPENSATE FOR APERTURE DISCONTINUITIES (SEGMENT GAPS AND/OR SECONDARY MIRROR SUPPORTS) BY CONTROLLING DEFORMABLE MIRRORS IN A NONLINEAR WAVEFRONT CONTROL REGIME NOT UTILIZED BEFORE BUT CONCEPTUALLY SIMILAR TO THE BEAM RESHAPING USED IN PIAA CORONAGRAPHY. WE PROPOSE HERE AN IN-AIR DEMONSTRATION AT 1E-7 CONTRAST, ENABLED BY ADDING A SECOND DEFORMABLE MIRROR TO OUR CURRENT TEST-BED. THIS EXPANSION OF THE SCOPE OF OUR CURRENT EFFORTS IN EXOPLANET IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES WILL ENABLING US TO DEMONSTRATE AN INTEGRATED SOLUTION FOR WAVEFRONT CONTROL AND STARLIGHT SUPPRESSION ON COMPLEX APERTURE GEOMETRIES. IT IS DIRECTLY APPLICABLE AT SCALES FROM MODERATE-COST EXOPLANET PROBE MISSIONS TO THE 2.4 M AFTA TELESCOPES TO FUTURE FLAGSHIP UVOIR OBSERVATORIES WITH APERTURES POTENTIALLY 16-20 M. SEARCHING FOR NEARBY HABITABLE WORLDS WITH DIRECT IMAGING IS ONE OF THE TOP SCIENTIFIC PRIORITIES ESTABLISHED BY THE ASTRO2010 DECADAL SURVEY. ACHIEVING THIS AMBITIOUS GOAL WILL REQUIRE 1E-10 CONTRAST ON A TELESCOPE LARGE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE ANGULAR RESOLUTION AND SENSITIVITY TO PLANETS AROUND A SIGNIFICANT SAMPLE OF NEARBY STARS. SUCH A MISSION MUST OF COURSE ALSO BE REALIZED AT AN ACHIEVABLE COST. LIGHTWEIGHT SEGMENTED MIRROR TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS LARGER DIAMETER OPTICS TO FIT IN ANY GIVEN LAUNCH VEHICLE AS COMPARED TO MONOLITHIC MIRRORS, AND LOWERS TOTAL LIFE-CYCLE COSTS FROM CONSTRUCTION THROUGH INTEGRATION&TEST, MAKING IT A COMPELLING OPTION FOR FUTURE LARGE SPACE TELESCOPES. AT SMALLER SCALES, ON-AXIS DESIGNS WITH SECONDARY OBSCURATIONS AND SUPPORTS ARE LESS CHALLENGING TO FABRICATE AND THUS MORE AFFORDABLE THAN THE OFF-AXIS UNOBSCURED PRIMARY MIRROR DESIGNS ENVISIONED IN MANY PAST MISSION CONCEPT STUDIES. BUT UNTIL RECENTLY, IT WAS BELIEVED THAT INTERNAL CORONAGRAPHS WERE INCAPABLE OF YIELDING VERY HIGH CONTRAST ON SEGMENTED OR OBSCURED TELESCOPES. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS NOW SHOW THAT THERE IS IN FACT A CLEAR PATH TO HIGH CONTRAST CORONAGRAPHY ON SUCH APERTURES. FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS WE HAVE BEEN PURSUING HIGH CONTRAST IMAGING DEVELOPMENT FOR SEGMENTED TELESCOPES, SUPPORTED IN PART BY APRA (AWARD NNX12AG05G, ROSES 2011). THE ACAD ALGORITHM, DEVELOPED IN THE COURSE OF OUR CURRENT APRA, IN PRINCIPLE APPEARS TO ENABLE HIGH CONTRAST CORONAGRAPHY ON OBSCURED APERTURES AS WE SET OUT TO ACHIEVE. THE PRACTICAL LABORATORY DEMONSTRATION OF THIS NEW ALGORITHM NOW REQUIRES ADDITIONAL RESOURCES NOT FORESEEN AT THE TIME OF OUR PRIOR PROPOSAL. CHIEF OF THESE IS THE NEED FOR A SECOND BOSTON MICROMACHINES DEFORMABLE MIRROR. THE ACAD ALGORITHM RELIES ON THE CONVERSION OF PHASE TO AMPLITUDE AS LIGHT PROPAGATES BETWEEN TWO DEFORMABLE MIRRORS AT DIFFERING OPTICAL CONJUGATES; A SECOND DM IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO ITS LABORATORY DEMONSTRATION AND VALIDATION. WE PROPOSE NOW TO DEMONSTRATE THE ACAD ALGORITHM IN AIR AT A CONTRAST OF #tilde#1E-7 IN NARROW SPECTRAL BANDS, AND EXTEND THAT PERFORMANCE THROUGH DEVELOPMENT OF BROAD BAND #tilde# 20%) OPTIMIZATION METHODS.

FLARES ARE OFTEN SEEN AS A TUMULTUOUS BREAKUP OF A PREVIOUSLY STABLE CONFIGURATION LEADING TO RELEASE OF A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ENERGY, MATERIAL ERUPTION, PARTICLE ACCELERATION, AND RESTRUCTURING OF MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION. THIS MAGNETIC RESTRUCTURING MAY BE A KEY FOR UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSICS OF PROCESSES TAKING PLACE THROUGHOUT THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE IN RESPONSE TO FLARES: MAGNETIC FIELD SUPPLIES ENERGY TO FLARES, AND SERVES AS A TRIGGER AND AS A CONDUIT OF ENERGY TRANSPORT. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO INVESTIGATE THE MAGNETIC RESTRUCTURING ASSOCIATED WITH FLARES AND ITS EFFECTS ON THERMODYNAMIC PROCESSES IN THE LOW SOLAR ATMOSPHERE. THE CHANGES IN THE MAGNETIC FIELD WILL BE EVALUATED IN RESPECT TO TWO ALTERNATIVE MODELS: CORONAL IMPLOSION AND TWIST REMOVAL MODEL. EITHER OF THESE SCENARIOS MAY TAKE PLACE IN FLARES, BUT THE TWO MODELS CAN BE DISTINGUISHED BASED ON EXPECTED MAGNETIC FIELD CHANGES. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS BASED ON FULL VECTOR MAGNETIC FIELD DATA FROM TWO NASA MISSIONS, SDO AND HINODE, AND SUPPLEMENTED WITH OBSERVATIONS FROM TWO GROUND-BASED INSTRUMENTS, GONG (LINE-OF-SIGHT ONLY) AND SOLIS (VECTOR DATA). THESE TWO AUXILIARY DATA SETS WILL ENHANCE THE INTERPRETATION OF SDO DATA, STRENGTHEN THE STATISTICS. THE AUXILIARY DATA SETS COULD BE CRITICAL IN FINDING THE PROPER INTERPRETATION IN CASES WHEN THE MAGNETIC FIELD DERIVATIONS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE POOR SPECTRAL RESOLUTION OF HMI, OR HAMPERED BY THE POOR TEMPORAL CADENCE OF SOT/SP. THESE DATA SETS WILL ALSO ALLOW INCLUDING FLARES PRIOR TO SDO LAUNCH FOR GREATER STATISTICAL SAMPLE, IF NEEDED. SOLIS CA II 854.2 NM LINE-OF-SIGHT (LOS) MAGNETOGRAMS WILL EXPAND THE STUDY TO THE CHROMOSPHERE. USING SDO VECTOR MAGNETOGRAMS WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE CHANGES IN ORIENTATION AND STRENGTH OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD AND THE ASSOCIATED CHANGES IN LORENTZ FORCE. FOR SELECTED CASES, WE WILL ALSO DERIVE PSEUDO-VECTOR FIELDS USING HIGH-CADENCE SDO/HMI AND GONG LINE-OF-SIGHT (LOS) MAGNETOGRAMS BASED ON THE APPROACH OF AZIMUTHAL AVERAGING. EVOLUTION OF THE DERIVED PSEUDO-VECTOR FIELDS DURING FLARES WILL BE INVESTIGATED AND VALIDATED WITH THE RESULT FROM SDO/HMI VECTOR MAGNETOGRAMS. TO INVESTIGATE CHANGES IN THERMODYNAMIC PARAMETERS ASSOCIATED WITH FLARES, WE WILL USE EXISTING OBSERVATIONS OF FLARING REGIONS WITH THE STOKES POLARIMETER ON HINODE. IN ADDITION, WE WILL USE EXISTING FLARE OBSERVATIONS WITH SOLIS FOR A FEW SELECTED FLARES AND CONDUCT NEW OBSERVATIONS IF NEEDED. AS A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT, SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL SOLIS OBSERVATIONAL FLARE CAMPAIGNS WERE CONDUCTED IN THE PAST. THE USE OF SOLIS DATA WILL ENHANCE THE INTERPRETATION OF SDO/HMI SPECTRAL DATA AS SOLIS/VSM HAS HIGHER SPECTRAL SAMPLING AS COMPARED WITH SDO/HMI DATA. CHANGES IN THERMODYNAMIC PARAMETERS WILL SHOW THE EFFECT OF FLARES THROUGH THE FORMATION HEIGHT RANGE OF THE FE I 630.1-630.2 NM PHOTOSPHERIC AND CA I 854.2 NM CHROMOSPHERIC SPECTRAL LINES. FINALLY, WE WILL COMPARE THE LOCATION OF FOOTPOINTS OF FLARE LOOPS DERIVED FROM RHESSI OBSERVATIONS IN AN ENERGY RANGE OF 50-300 KEV WITH THE LOCATIONS THAT SHOW SIGNIFICANT TOPOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE MAGNETIC FIELD. WE WILL EXAMINE THE RATE OF FLUX LOSS IN THE RECONNECTION EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH FLARES.

If successful, the range measurements would: 1) establish sub-centimeter constraints on the location of LRO with respect to the exquisitely-well-determined locations of the laser reflectors on the moon. In so doing, this would: 1a) provide a calibration of the LRO clock, more rigorously than the one-way ranging campaign is capable of doing; 1b) provide a firm reference for laser altimetry of the lunar surface, which will operate simultaneously to the two-way ranging; 2) answer questions about the health of the 40-year-old reflectors on the lunar surface by comparison of signal strengths; 3) represent the farthest-ever two-way laser ranging to a spacecraft. APOLLO has already invested significant resources into preparing for successful two-way ranging. This includes new hardware to enable a wider detector gate, software to create time-of-flight predictions, tracking paths, velocity aberration point-ahead displacements, etc. In addition, the observatory has developed the software to allow the telescope to track arbitrary paths on the sky. Aside from the preparatory work, carrying out the observations requires continued resources. The observations are performed by Russet McMillan, requiring two hours of effort for each hour spent on the sky. Two aircraft spotters are required to protect airplanes from accidental illumination, at 1.5 hours of effort per hour of observation. And finally, the telescope is operated by the Astrophysics Research Consortium (ARC), based on financial support from a number of universities. The equivalent operational cost of running the telescope is $1,116 per hour of scheduled time. Since ranging to LRO is external to ARC, this charge must be borne by external funds. In total, we request $50,942 to support 40 hours of telescope time in pursuit of successful two-way ranging. A discounted rate of $1,000 per hour of telescope time, together with support for 80 hours of McMillan's time, and 120 hours of spotter support adds to $49,520. The additional $1,422 is in support of Russell Owen's time to incorporate changes to the telescope control software to allow tracking of paths on the sky described by Chebyshev polynomials. We anticipate a direct subcontract between the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and ARC, spanning from September 2010 to December 2012. The long span permits optimal choice of observing opportunities, which come in groups of a half-dozen or so nights spread across two months, recurring every six months. Telescope scheduling constraints, together with constraints imposed by the LRO Mission Operations Center (MOC) do not allow us to utilize every favorable opportunity. A several-year span is necessary to provide ample opportunity for success.",,,,,,,,,,,,

IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE EXPLORE SEVERAL SCIENCE TOPICS THAT ARE INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH ION-NEUTRAL COUPLING BETWEEN THE IONOSPHERE AND THERMOSPHERE. WHILE THESE PHENOMENA HAVE ALL BEEN OBSERVED, THEY ARE UNEXPLAINED.  WE USE A NEW COUPLED MODEL TO EXPLORE IN DETAIL THE PHYSICS BEHIND THE PHENOMENA.  THE WORK WILL INVOLVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODEL POSTPROCESSORS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO UNDERSTAND THE DETAILED MECHANISMS THAT ARE AT WORK, AND THEIR COMPLEX INTERACTIONS.  THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS STUDY ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE RELEVANCE TO OTHER PLASMA SYSTEMS COUPLED VIA NEUTRAL-IONIZED INTERACTIONS THROUGHOUT THE HELIOSPHERE.  THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ADDRESSES THREE CRITICAL SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS:1)  WHAT ARE THE PHYSICAL MECHANISMS THAT GENERATE THE QUIET TIME LOW LATITUDE DYNAMO AND PRE?  2)  WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF LOWER AND MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE DISTURBANCES SUCH AS SUDDEN STRATOSPHERIC WARMING S ON THE IONOSPHERIC ELECTRODYNAMICS?   3)  WHAT ARE THE ION-NEUTRAL COUPLING PROCESSES THAT GENERATE DENSITY DEPLETIONS IN THE EQUATORIAL IONOSPHERE?THE RESEARCH WILL EMPLOY AN IMPROVED FIRST-PRINCIPLES NUMERICAL MODELING CAPABILITY OF THE IONOSPHERE-THERMOSPHERE SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED UNDER OTHER NASA FUNDING. THIS NEW MODEL HAS COUPLED THE SAM13 MODEL OF THE IONOSPHERE WITH THE TIMEGCM MODEL OF THE THERMOSPHERE.  NEW MODEL POSTPROCESSORS WILL BE DEVELOPED, AND USED TOGETHER WITH GROUND-BASED RADAR AND C/NOFS SATELLITE DATA TO UNCOVER THE DETAILED MECHANISMS DRIVING: (A) THE IONOSPHERIC DYNAMO AND PRE, (B) THE EFFECT OF SUDDEN STRATOSPHERIC WARMING S ON THE ION-NEUTRAL COUPLING AND RESULTING ELECTRODYNAMICS, AND (C) THE RECENTLY DISCOVERED THE EQUATORIAL DAWN DENSITY DEPLETIONS, THE DATA FROM THE C/NOFS SATELLITE, TOGETHER WITH GROUND-BASED RADARS WILL BE USED TO TEST AND VALIDATE THE FINDINGS FROM THE MODEL AND THE POSTPROCESSORS.

SSW EVENTS ARE CAUSED BY RAPID CHANGES IN THE MEAN STRATOSPHERIC ZONAL FLOW ACCOMPANIED BY AN ENHANCEMENT IN PLANETARY WAVE ACTIVITY, WHICH AS A RESULT CAN PRODUCE LARGE PERTURBATIONS IN THE ELECTRODYNAMICS AND ELECTRON DENSITY AT IONOSPHERIC HEIGHTS EVEN AT LOW-LATITUDES.  IT IS NOW RECOGNIZED THAT, FOR A BETTER SPECIFICATION OF THE IONOSPHERIC VARIABILITY, A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF SSW EVENTS AND THE COUPLING WITH THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE IS NEEDED. MUCH OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE IONOSPHERIC VARIABILITY DURING SSWS, HOWEVER, HAS COME FROM OBSERVATION MADE INDEPENDENTLY AND ONLY AT A FEW LOCATIONS. NEVERTHELESS, THESE OBSERVATIONS HAVE PROVIDED IMPORTANT BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE SSW EFFECTS IN THE IONOSPHERE. A BROADER, MORE GLOBAL, OBSERVATIONAL CAPABILITY AND MORE COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSES ARE REQUIRED TO UNAMBIGUOUSLY REVEAL THE GLOBAL RESPONSE OF THE IONOSPHERE TO SSW EVENTS. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ELUCIDATE THE GLOBAL IONOSPHERIC SIGNATURES ASSOCIATED WITH SSW EVENTS IN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE. TO REACH THIS GOAL, WE WILL ANSWER THE FOLLOWING SCIENCE QUESTIONS: A) WHAT IS THE TIME-DEPENDENT THREE-DIMENSIONAL (LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, ALTITUDE) RESPONSE OF THE IONOSPHERE TO SSW EVENTS AND HOW DOES THE IONOSPHERE EVOLVE THROUGH THE SSW RECOVERY PHASE? B) HOW DO THE EFFECTS OF SH SSW EVENTS ON THE EQUATORIAL AND LOW-LATITUDE IONOSPHERE COMPARE WITH THOSE DUE TO THE NH SSWS? C) WHAT IS THE GLOBAL STRUCTURE OF THE LUNAR SEMI-DIURNAL PERTURBATION IN THE IONOSPHERE AND TO WHAT EXTENT IS IT MODIFIED BY THE SSWS? TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS WE WILL USE FOUR-DIMENSIONAL (LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, HEIGHT AND TIME) IMAGES OF THE GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE IONOSPHERIC ELECTRON DENSITY. THESE IMAGES WILL BE OBTAINED USING A VARIETY OF DATA SOURCES AND THE IONOSPHERIC DATA ASSIMILATION FOUR-DIMENSIONAL (IDA4D) ALGORITHM. AN INVESTIGATION OF THE VARIABILITY IN THE ELECTRON DENSITY IMAGES AND UNDERLYING ELECTRODYNAMIC PROCESSES TAKING PLACE DURING THE MOST RECENT SSW EVENTS WILL BE AIDED BY UNIQUE OBSERVATIONS OF EQUATORIAL ELECTRIC FIELDS MADE BY THE ION VELOCITY METER (IVM) INSTRUMENT ONBOARD THE COMMUNICATION/NAVIGATION OUTAGE FORECASTING SYSTEM (C/NOFS) SATELLITE. THE RESULTS OF THE PROPOSED WORK WILL PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE, GLOBAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE IONOSPHERIC RESPONSE TO DIFFERENT TYPES AND MAGNITUDES OF SSW EVENTS. OUR ANALYSIS WILL PROVIDE THE TIME EVOLUTION OF THE IONOSPHERIC DISTURBANCES ASSOCIATED WITH SSW EVENTS.

A complex Aquarius calibration/validation effort is being planned using available and new in situ records, but issues of collocation in time and depth and mismatch in spatial coverage will present significant challenges.  This proposal complements the calibration/validation efforts with a modeling component to help determine the expected variations of SSS with depth and the amount of short timescale SSS variance that may be present in the upper ocean.  Using as a basis model estimates that are constrained to most available ocean observations, including in situ salinity, but have relatively thick (10 m) upper layers, experiments with higher vertical resolutions near the surface will be performed.  Results from runs for the period overlapping the Aquarius mission will be compared to the satellite SSS measurements as well as to the in situ data.  Budget analyses of SSS will help determine the relation between Aquarius data, upper ocean SSS structures, and the air-sea forcing fluxes.

Toward Assimilation of Satellite Data in Modeling Water Vapor Fluxes over Land  This project applies microwave and infrared satellite data to improve model estimations of evaporation over land. These satellite data contain information about near-surface soil and vegetative moisture. The relationships of the measurements to the fluxes is indirect, so analysis of fluxes depends on mathematical or statistical models, which integrate information from other sources. For fluxes over global land areas, bulk formulations for the fluxes are problematic because there are essential parameters for which reliable information is not available, and because the results are highly sensitive to errors in these parameters and to errors in the satellite-provided variables. Data assimilation systems are an attractive option because they have the potential to optimally account for the information content and the error characteristics of all the data sources, while introducing physical constraints with a numerical model. Successful assimilation requires that the model parameterizations and variables are compatible with the satellite measurement sensitivities. When they are incompatible, the satellite information is effectively rejected or misguides the analysis. In this project, we will identify environments and regions where current land surface models are inconsistent with satellite-derived parameters related to evaporation, and hence where modeled evaporative fluxes are likely to be erroneous. This identification will be done employing simple physical and statistical models of expected relationships. For selected environments where inconsistencies are prominent, we will characterize the discrepancies by performing detailed analyses of model variables and satellite and in-situ measurements. The analyses will focus on the surface transfer processes for moisture and energy, and remote sensing phenomenology. The results are intended to provide direction toward improving surface models and their assimilation of data for water vapor flux modeling. This improvement is an essential step toward monitoring and predicting variability of water and energy cycles as manifestations of global change.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Fe-peak elements are key diagnostics of explosive supernova nucleosynthesis. Key to this work is the generation of the first accurate K-sheU electron-impact excitation data for Cr, Mn, Co and Ni. The excitation data will be calculated using the R-matrix method with both Auger and radiative damping included in the resonant excitation channels. We will also calculate ionization and recombination data for these elements, to be used in non-equilibrium ionization modeling. This will allow us to determine the abundances of these heavy elements, and characterize their ionization ages and temperatures. We expect to see differences in the MnlCr yields for remnants ofthermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae such as Tycho's SNR and those of core-collapse (Type II) supernovae such as Cas A.

Of particular interest to the proposed research are polymers reinforced with carbon nanotubes and nanofibers. These nanocomposites have shown great potential as structural materials and adhesives under static loading conditions. However, knowing the quasi-static fracture and failure properties of aerospace materials is typically insufficient, as most materials become more brittle at high-strain rate and/or cryogenic temperatures. Additionally, aerospace structures often encounter dynamic transient loading events ranging from tool drop to space debris impact. The destructive capability of seemingly harmless foam traveling at high speeds and cold temperatures was demonstrated tragically in 2003 with the Columbia space shuttle. An understanding of the dynamic failure behavior of aerospace materials is therefore critical for structural safety. The proposed experimental methods can be utilized to accurately determine dynamic crack initiation toughness (Kcr), as well as dynamic fracture toughness as a function of crack growth parameters such as velocity and acceleration. The current setup is designed for testing relatively small samples (1##x1##), but the methodology can easily be scaled down to characterize even smaller specimens. Optically measured stress intensity factors for isotropic acrylic samples have been verified with a computational model. A linear relationship has also been found between pressure input and stress output from the device, allowing for dynamic material characterization over a broad range of strain rates. By altering the material of the pulse shaper and/or striker, an even wider array of strain rates has been attained. The final objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of this device for measuring fracture parameters of novel anisotropic materials, including orthotropic nanocomposites and adhesives employed in joining dissimilar materials. A gas-gun has been constructed that delivers a one-point impact to a relatively small sample in a controlled fashion. The gas gun launches a cylindrical striker into the long incident bar, sending a stress pulse along the incident bar and into the specimen. Ultra-high-speed digital photography of pre-notched acrylic samples tested on the apparatus show that fracture occurs over a few microseconds, whereas the sample##s motion is perceived in the millisecond time scale (due to inertial effects). Therefore, no additional supports are necessary to insure that crack initiation and propagation occur within the field-of-view of the camera. Using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method, images collected at #tilde#300,000 frames/sec are compared to those recorded in the undeformed state in order to map deformations in the region of interest. These displacement fields are used to extract fracture parameters, including fracture toughness, stress intensity factors, and crack velocity. Strain gages on the incident bar can then be used to independently verify optically measured stress intensity factors using finite element analysis. The device is designed to cost-effectively test the dynamic fracture properties of materials, both at crack initiation and during crack propagation. Test results will describe not only the initial toughness of the material, but also its ability to resist further crack growth once crack propagation has begun. The apparatus was created for the dynamic fracture testing of newly engineered materials which are expensive to produce in traditional specimen sizes. This methodology is also ideal for testing biomaterials such as bone and bone cement, which are difficult to procure in large sizes. This simple device is inexpensive to construct. By scaling down these methods, current camera technology will allow the future testing of significantly smaller samples, thereby decreasing development costs.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently evidence for global warming has become increasingly difficult to refute, with numerous surveys showing clear increasing trends in average surface and air temperatures. Intensive investigation on climate changes requires fine-grained monitoring and modeling of long-term regional and global climate and weather conditions. The growth of computing power has greatly propelled NASA climate and weather models, such as GEOS-5 and MODEL-E, to achieve good spatial and temporal resolutions. However, these models have seen little improvements in their I/O software stack, resulting in an outcry for commensurate data management capability, including data creation, movement, reanalysis, assimilation, and visualization. In the mean time, there is an ever-widening gap between the speed of CPU processors and that of storage devices. Thus efficient I/O has become a very challenging issue for NASA's climate and weather models. In this project, we propose to design and develop an elastic parallel I/O (EPIO) framework for NASA computational climate and weather models. The main theme of EPIO is to integrate proven I/O technologies, ADIOS and AsyncIO, and design a set of extended APIs that can enhance the existing I/O practices in NASA models. To this aim, we propose the following research activities. First, we will investigate I/O requirements of NASA models such as GEOS-5, MODEL-E, and GCE. Accordingly we will design and develop EPIO as a user-friendly, non-invasive I/O infrastructure that enables NASA models with efficient I/O on NASA computing facilities. Second, through EPIO, we will support NASA models with advanced I/O techniques such as data staging, binary packed format, and workflow coupling for efficient post-processing such as data reanalysis, assimilation, and visualization on Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) leadership facilities. Third, to prepare NASA models for future systems, we will design and develop proof-of-concept I/O techniques. These include topology-aware I/O client selection on highly hierarchical interconnection networks, balanced data distribution through space filing curves, and multi-level data deduplication to reduce network bandwidth consumptions and storage footprints. Last but not least, we will have a comprehensive assessment and evaluation plan to validate EPIO, and enable its smooth adoption by NASA climate models for very high-resolution simulations on NASA and ORNL computer systems. This project will have great significance for NASA's climate and weather predictions. The primary outcome from the proposed EPIO framework will be an I/O middleware library that is equipped with user-friendly, non-invasive APIs, and can seamlessly transform NASA climate and weather models for optimal I/O performance on NASA and ORNL facilities. Together, these software facilities can parallelize I/O inputs and outputs in NASA models, streamline data movement among workflows of NASA climate simulation, data assimilation, and data visualization systems, thereby significantly enhancing spatial and temporal resolutions of climate and weather predictions. Climatologists will be able to exploit recent architectural advances in computers without being overwhelmed by hardware and software intricacies. Upon completion of this project, the increased I/O efficiency will result in fast turnaround time (i.e., more executions completed per hour), making better use of the existing computing and I/O resources. This work will be of interest to all NASA centers deploying high performance computing facilities and running climate and weather models, as well as other organizations such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",,,,,,,,,,,,
