STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEMS ARE ENVISAGED TO PROVIDE TWO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT CAPABILITIES FOR THE HEALTH MONITORING OF FUTURE AEROSPACE VEHICLES: DETECTING STRUCTURAL DAMAGE AND PERFORMING USAGE MONITORING. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS STATEMENT OF WORK IS TO BRING TOGETHER THESE TWO TECHNOLOGIES IN AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM DEMONSTRATION ON LARGE SCALE AEROSPACE VEHICLE STRUCTURES. INNOVATIVE CONCEPTS CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED BY ACELLENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC THROUGH AN SBIR PHASE I CONTRACT WILL BE APPLIED IN CONJUNCTION WITH RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY NASA DRYDEN IN A MULTI-PHASED SBIR PHASE III PROJECT.  THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY IS TO INCORPORATE PIEZOELECTRIC TRANSDUCERS (FOR DAMAGE DETECTION) AND FIBER OPTIC SENSORS (FOR USAGE MONITORING) INTO AN INTEGRATED STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING PACKAGE FOR INSTALLATIONS ON LARGE-SCALE AEROSPACE VEHICLE STRUCTURES. AS A FIRST STEP IN ACHIEVING THIS OVERALL GOAL, AN INTEGRATED DEMONSTRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED IN WHICH FIBER OPTIC SENSORS FOR USAGE MONITORING WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO A SINGLE PACKAGE THAT CAN SIMPLIFY CURRENT ATTACHMENT TECHNIQUES FOR LARGE SCALE APPLICATION.  THIS FIRST STEP IS DIRECTED AT ADDRESSING A DEFICIENCY IN BONDING ENORMOUS NUMBER OF FIBER OPTIC SENSORS TO THE SURFACES OF REALISTIC STRUCTURES. A RECENT EFFORT, FUNDED BY NASA\'S AERONAUTICS RESEARCH MISSION DIRECTORATE, HAS INVOLVED THE INSTALLATION OF APPROXIMATELY 3000 FIBER BRAGG GRATING (FBG) STRAIN SENSORS LOCATED ON SIX- 20-FT OPTICAL FIBERS BONDED TO THE UPPER WING SURFACES OF AN EXISTING PREDATOR-B (NAMED IKHANA). THESE FIBERS WERE INSTALLED USING CONVENTIONAL STRAIN SENSOR INSTALLATION TECHNIQUES. SUCH CONVENTIONAL INSTALLATION TECHNIQUES INVOLVED THE MASKING OF APPROXIMATELY 120-FT-LONG X 1 IN-WIDE RUNS ON THE UPPER WING SURFACES, HAND GRINDING THE PAINT AND COMPOSITE FILLER DOWN TO THE WING SURFACE ALONG THESE RUNS, ADHERING THE OPTICAL FIBERS TO THE WING SURFACES USING CONVENTIONAL STRAIN GAGE ADHESIVES AND PROCESSES, SEALING/SMOOTHING THE FINAL COATING OVER THE INSTALLATION, AND RE-PAINTING. WHILE ENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL THROUGHOUT FLIGHT TESTING, THESE TECHNIQUES ARE NOT OPTIMAL FOR ACCOMMODATING A GREATER NUMBER OF OPTICAL FIBERS IN MORE COMPLEX PATTERNS (E.G. THREE-AXIS, ROSETTE MEASUREMENTS). COMPLICATING THE PROBLEM IS THE FACT THAT LARGE-SCALE REALISTIC AIRCRAFT STRUCTURES ARE GEOMETRICALLY COMPLEX AND INCLUDE NUMEROUS EGRESS PORTS FOR UMBILICAL ATTACHMENTS, COMMUNICATIONS AND POWER CONNECTIONS, FUEL TANK PORTS, ACTUATOR HOUSING, AND STRUCTURALLY COMPLEX FEATURES SUCH AS STIFFENERS, FLANGES, GAPS, AND WING FOLDS. SUCH GEOMETRIC COMPLEXITIES MAKE THE EXTENSION OF CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES, SUCH AS THOSE USED ON THE IKHANA FLIGHT EXPERIMENT, FOR REALISTIC AEROSPACE STRUCTURES. AS A STEP TOWARDS THE HIGH-LEVEL GOAL, NASA DRYDEN IS SEEKING TO PARTNER WITH ACELLENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE AND EFFICIENT CONCEPTS AND APPROACHES FOR THE INSTALLATION OF THOUSANDS OF FIBER OPTIC SENSORS, MULTIPLEXED ALONG DOZENS OF OPTICAL FIBERS, ARRAYED IN COMPLEX PATTERNS (TO ACCOMMODATE ROSETTE MEASUREMENTS), BONDED TO THE SURFACE OF COMPLEX AEROSPACE VEHICLE STRUCTURES (E.G. LIFTING SURFACES, FUSELAGE, BULKHEADS). THIS STATEMENT OF WORK DEFINES TASKS THAT WILL PRODUCE SEVERAL NEW INSTALLATION CONCEPTS AMENABLE TO 1) RETRO-FIT EXISTING (I..E. ALREADY BUILT AND DEPLOYED) AEROSPACE VEHICLES (HEREAFTER REFERRED TO AS  RETRO-FIT  INSTALLATIONS), AND 2) INTEGRATE AS A STEP IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS OF COMPOSITE STRUCTURES FOR NEW AEROSPACE VEHICLES (HEREAFTER REFERRED TO AS  DURING FABRICATION  INSTALLATIONS). SUCH INSTALLATION TECHNIQUES AND APPROACHES WILL BE LIMITED IN SCOPE TO SURFACE, OR NEAR-SURFACE ATTACHMENTS, NOT EMBEDDED WITHIN THE COMPOSITE STRUCTURE.

This active control component will be capable of modulating fuel flow at multiple injection locations with minimum fuel pressure drop and thus enable critical improvements in aerospace vehicle turbine engine combustion dynamics, notably mitigation of thermo-acoustic instabilities. These instabilities have impeded development of advanced lean-burning combustors for reduction of NOx emissions and improvements in combustion efficiency. While passive approaches to control combustion instability have been successful on particular new engine designs, the ultimate solution is active combustion control where the greatest challenges are the bandwidth (1 kHz) and system temperature requirements. The Phase-I goal is to demonstrate that these are achievable by designing and building a proof-of-principle system complete with high-frequency, high-temperature actuator and valve. Active Signal has selected Terfenol as the most suitable actuator material and will apply 25 plus years of actuator, valve and pump experience to meet the goals. The system will be tested against pressure and flow requirements to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach before fabricating a prototype suitable for the GRC test stand in Phase II."

It offers advantages in performance, ease of cleanup, compatibility with on-board environmental systems, and ability to recharge during a mission. ADA Technologies has designed a prototype hand-held extinguisher that is being tested at ambient environmental conditions.  In this SBIR program ADA Technologies proposes to advance this prototype with a new design for a reduced-momentum nozzle to generate a fine water mist that can be discharged into confined and obstructed spaces to attack hidden fires as well as open fires in manned spacecraft. In Phase I multiple nozzle concepts will be designed, fabricated, and competed to identify the most promising concepts. In addition, we will adapt a vacuum chamber at team member Colorado School of Mines to evaluate the advanced nozzles against fires in an atmosphere of 34% oxygen and 7.6 psia total pressure, representative of the conditions in manned spacecraft. These tests will validate the efficacy of Fine Water Mist at these nonstandard atmospheric conditions. Phase I products will include a comprehensive specification for a beta prototype hand-held FWM extinguisher that incorporates the best advanced reduced momentum nozzle.   In Phase II we will carry the beta prototype design forward to testing in microgravity and develop a plan for flight qualification of the hardware. We will work with a partner experienced in the production and qualification of flight test fixtures and experiments. ADA will partner with a commercial supplier of fire protection equipment to take this technology into the broader commercial marketplace, targeting aerospace and flammable fuels storage as early market segments.

Due to the rapid expanse of space exploration, a need has been identified for the proper handling of extraterrestrial samples. Not only must the sample return system maintain the physical integrity of the sample in sometimes rigorous conditions (e.g., rover driving loads, diurnal temperature fluctuations, cruise, atmospheric entry and impact), it must address potential contamination issues. The samples themselves can become contaminated and they also present a serious contamination danger to the Earth. Therefore, the highest possible level of precaution must be exercised when handling the outer space samples until there are studies proving them harmless. In this Phase I project, we are proposing a foam-in-the-capsule"" system for containing and encapsulating samples of extraterrestrial material to be returned to Earth for detailed study. The system will eliminate or dramatically reduce the risk of contamination on flight hardware and ease the handling of the sample on the spacecraft, in landing, and in the process of sample transfer to the appropriate facility for investigation. The ""foam-in-the-capsule"" system combines the effectiveness of encapsulation and flexibility to improve design according to new scientific data or changes in the capsule carrier's interior. The proposed system consists of a compliant outer restraint based upon the DoverPacREG system for containment of potent pharmaceutical powders and a foam-in-place encapsulation process. The decontamination foam will be effectively sealed within the inflatable polymer capsules. The dimensions of the capsules are variable to fit the dimensions of the sample to be encapsulated. Sterilization of the encapsulated sample container before opening through the incineration of the foam encapsulant is possible."""

Known as lunar regolith, it poses a hazard in the form of dust clouds being generated by all forms of gas expansions in the high vacuum environment of the lunar surface. This is especially pronounced during spacecraft operations. Instruments placed on the moon by the Apollo mission showed marked degradation due to damage from dust released during the lander's takeoff. Since there is no air movement to remove the dust after it is deposited, it is essential that dust is not displaced during everyday operations of a permanent lunar installation.  Adherent Technologies, Inc. (ATI) has over the last decade developed a number of specialty UV curing resins for NASA applications in space. ATI is proposing to develop a resin and dispenser system to coat large areas of lunar surface around landing pads and atmosphere locks with a thin, dust-stabilizing coating.

The Adler's goals are to inspire children to develop a lifelong interest in science, expand its cun''ent audience, address community needs in math and science education, reach out to fiunilies and encourage an interest in STEM careers. Nationwide research about the state of scientific literacy in America provides an additional, compelling argument for transfOIming how the Adler engages children and their parents in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) learning and education. With six billion people on Earth, only a handful of humans wil1 have the privilege of going into space and visiting other worlds. TIlOse who go become witnesses for the rest - the eyes and ears, the hearts and spirits for the rest of humanity. But it takes a diverse team of thousands of scientists, engineers, technology and math-savvy individuals to accomplish these goals. When humans eventual1y set foot on Mars with their eyes fixed on other planets and moons, it may be the greatest story of the 21st century. When the first man or woman creates those historic footprints, at that moment every human being will stand vicariously in those boots. The accomplishments of the entire team will be celebrated.  The Adler is preparing itself to engage its visitors in this journey and exhilarating dream by making space sciences accessible. Astronomy and cosmology are diflicult to grasp yet essential to preparing for (and understanding) space exploration missions. In a new exhibition titled Deep Space Adventure, the Adler will promote renewed interest in science, space exploration and STEM careers. The Adler also will provide children with an exciting museum experience to spark their enthusiasm for space exploration, science, math and technology, and encourage them to consider their roles in future space missions. Their generation inherits a great legacy from voyages and discoveries of earlier centuries. To engage them in STEM at an early age, the Adler is developing the Explorers'' Club exhibition.  Through renovated galleries featuring new exhibitions, the Adler will motivate children to grasp their futures as designers of missions to explore the mysteries of the universe, or as biologists who discover life on other worlds. The Adler's plans answer a nationwide call to catalyze children's interest in STEM, and provide them with quality science education experiences to prepare for the demands of the future workforce, and ensure America's future economic vitality."""

The samples, from the Moon, Mars, Earth and the asteroid Vesta (a possible dwarf planet) would be obtained as meteorites from reputable dealers and would be mounted under Lexan domes serving both to magnify the objects and prevent vandalism. Visitors could touch the samples with a bent finger. Simple text and graphic panels will explain how each of the featured worlds fits into the broader context of planetary formation. This exhibit will allow visitors an opportunity to make a physical connection to the other worlds of the Solar System. This direct connection is particularly timely given the upcoming Dawn arrival at Vesta, the planned return to the Moon, and ongoing Mars exploration. To enhance the experience, the Adler would produce short interactive video segments that highlight how these samples came to be on the Earth, what their history and context was on their world of origin and the human story of how they came to be found and recognized as originating on another world. Scientists from the Planetary Science Institute would serve as both consulting experts and on-camera talent for the video segments and text/graphics panels. The exhibit elements would be designed to be modular and expandable. Once the basic template (mount and graphic panel design, video system details, video script outline and style elements etc.) was completed the exhibit would be easy to expand to include other samples. Particularly intriguing possibilities include possible Mercurian meteorites, if these are confirmed, as well as samples of other asteroid types. Because the exhibit will be functional as a stand-alone exhibit rather than just a supplement to other exhibits, it will be well suited to replication by small planetaria and science museums. The cost for each copy will be limited to actual materials and labor associated with construction, approximately 4000 - 5000 dollars per exhibit station, and so will be affordable under smaller grants or community funding. We will seek out partner institutions and follow-on funding for replicating and distributing exhibits."""

The Adler has identified the following goals for the new Sky Theater:  - Offer visitors a one-of-kind museum experience unavailable at any other cultural venue in Chicago or the United States; - Utilize leading-edge technologies and world-class science and educational practices; - Create an inspirational, unique and meaningful learning experience for school children, especially Chicago Public Schools (CPS) students, educators and families; - Transform the Sky Theater into an innovative, reprogrammable, multi-purpose venue for lectures, performances and other live events; - Maintain the Adler's 78-year tradition of offering thrilling, sophisticated shows; and - Increase museum attendance and earned revenue in support of educational programs. The new theater will engage young people-regardless of background or socio-economic status-in a compelling museum experience that sparks their interest in science at critical moments in their intellectual development. In particular for the Chicago area, the reinvention of the Sky Theater will play a leading role in the expansion of the Adler's service to the Chicago Public Schools, a district in which 85percent of students are low-income and 90percent are an ethnic minority. The flexibility of the new theater and its state-of-the-art technological and visual capabilities will enable the Adler to offer CPS school audiences a deeper, richer experience with science.

Research will be conducted in the Brazilian and Peruvian Amazon, at sites near Manaus and Iquitos. Activities will build on and extend research conducted under NASA-funded LBA projects. Current approaches for sampling tropical tree diversity rely on field investigations that sample only a small portion of key environmental gradients. This project will bring together a close coupling of extensive field measurements of tree diversity patterns, satellite remote sensing to enable sampling across regional disturbance gradients, and community simulation models to better understand the mechanisms responsible for observed patterns at regional scales. The overarching hypothesis is that tree species community assembly patterns at the landscape scale, driven by episodic disturbance events, differ significantly from community assembly patterns at the local (<100 ha) scale. The project has four major goals: First, episodic tree mortality disturbance will be mapped over large Amazon landscapes using Landsat imagery, enabling the development of disturbance chronosequences covering more than 20 years. Second, the chronosequence data will be used to direct extensive field sampling to quantify tree species patterns across the landscape as a function of disturbance intensity, and time since disturbance. Third, the detection threshold for shifts in PFTs from the competitor to colonizer guild will be explored using hyperspectral (Hyperion) imagery. Fourth, a tractable community assembly model will be developed to explore which community assemblage mechanisms best fit the observed landscape-level patterns. Results will provide an improved understanding of shifts in tree diversity and PFTs with disturbance, and will help inform future NASA missions including DESDynI and HyspIRI. This project will directly address the stated goal of better understanding the current condition of Amazon forest biodiversity, and how it is changing over time."

However, we propose that it is exactly the magnetic field, or, more precisely, the balance of open and closed magnetic structures on local (supergranular, #tilde#20Mm) and global (coronal, >#tilde#100Mm) in the photosphere and chromosphere that defines the thermodynamic properties of coronal holes, providing a realistic basis to explore the support and sustenance of the kinetic solar wind. The chromosphere has been largely overlooked as a driving source of the solar wind despite its richness in emission and structure, largely due to the aforementioned complexity. Recently, we [McIntosh and Leamon ApJL, 624, 117, 2005] correlated the inferred topography of the solar chromospheric plasma with in situ solar wind velocity and composition data measured at 1 AU. Specifically, the measured separation in height of the TRACE 1600 and 1700 UV band pass filters correlate very strongly with solar wind velocity and inversely with the ratio of ionic oxygen (O7+/O6+) densities. These correlations suggest that the structure of the solar wind is rooted deeper in the solar atmosphere than has been previously considered and form the basis of an empirical solar wind model. The proposed model provides a near continuous range of solar wind speeds and composition quantities from the structure of the chromosphere and is more precise than the old fast/ coronal hole or slow/streamer belt"" estimate. By means of a coherent, planned and extended observation campaign of the solar chromosphere at disk center, we propose to extend our current results to better understand the nature of the solar wind, its sources and composition. One specific end goal for this three- year project is to develop a (near) real-time solar wind propagation model, with chromospheric topography as input. This useful tool for predictive space weather will have great impact in 2008 when we can replace the intermittent TRACE data with the full-disk, full-time chromospheric topography measurements of the first LWS mission, the Solar Dynamics Observatory. This proposal addresses Strategic Sub-goal 3B: ""Understand the Sun and its effects on Earth and the solar system,"" specifically NASA Science Outcomes 3B1 and 3B3. However, our improved physical understanding will yield a better observationally driven, physically based ability, to predict space weather on its own and as part of a community based collaborative model within the LWS program."""

Proposed Effort: From studies it has become obvious that the key enablers for future groundbreaking progress in GA are not only increased affordability but also other critical requirements such as improved performance and fuel efficiency; improved safety; ease of operation; drastic reduction of noise; acceptable performance specification. The design and development of new GA aircraft, with novel technologies for addressing these issues, represents a daunting challenge because of the scope of the radical design constraints due to the requirements of ease of manufacturing and maintenance, noise control, drastically improved safety, and efficiency. The proposed development of a scientifically based tool box for scaled model research, once validated for a typical GA aircraft such as the Cirrus SR22 with a relatively large scale model, will allow for drastically more cost-effective investigations of future GA aircraft concepts and will also considerably reduce the cost associated with the development and testing of novel technologies for GA . Specific key innovations associated with the proposed approach are; model as low-cost test-bed for future GA concept and technology development. Due to the relatively large scale to the validation model, chances are high that aerodynamic, dynamic and aeroelastic testing of critical design parts of new GA concepts can be accomplished with satisfactory fidelity.; Large empty shell composite structure and modular design to allow for flexible placement of flight hardware and adjustment of moments o inertia; Use of state-of-the-art prediction and simulation tools as well as wind/water tunnel experiments in design and data evaluation of dynamically scaled model research. The cost associated with the development of new aircraft, and especially with the testing required for FAA approval of new aircraft and aircraft technologies, is very high and hinders and/or stalls efforts by GA-companies to bring new advanced aircraft or advanced aircraft technologies to the market. Any effort of implementing novel technologies is financially risky and suffocates whatever healthy initiative and innovative ideas exist in the aviation industry."

Pyrolysis is more amenable to handling mixed solid waste streams in a microgravity environment, but produces a more complex product stream. Oxidation (incineration) produces a simpler product stream, but the oxidation of mixed solids is a complex unit operation in a microgravity environment. Pyrolysis is endothermic and requires no oxygen, while oxidation is exothermic and requires oxygen. A previous NASA SBIR Phase I and Phase II project has successfully integrated pyrolysis of the solid waste and oxidation of the fuel gases into a single, batch processing prototype unit. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the feasibility of integrating pyrolysis, tar cracking, and oxidation steps into a compact, efficient system for processing of spacecraft solid wastes. This integration will result in a reduction in energy consumption, an overall reduction in system complexity, and a lower Equivalent System Mass (ESM). The objective of the Phase I study is to demonstrate the feasibility of this integration process using bench scale experiments. This will be accomplished in three tasks: 1) design and construct integrated bench scale unit; 2) laboratory studies using simulated solid waste sample; 3) evaluation of laboratory results and preliminary design of Phase II prototype."

AdvR, Inc will develop a fiber coupled, high power, electro-optically controlled, phase modulator for the NASA Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The device should be capable of phase modulating a 1 W or greater, continuous wave optical signal at multi-gigahertz rates at 1064 nm. The key innovation is the use of a waveguide embedded in a non-linear optical material suitable for high optical power handling. The phase modulators used for LISA must be rugged and must perform optimally in a radiation environment over the mission lifetime. To achieve this goal, the phase modulator development will include a fiber-in-fiber-out design that will readily lend itself to future space qualification for mechanical stability of the package and radiation damage resistance of the non-linear optical material. The Phase I effort successfully established the feasibility of the waveguide approach by achieving high power in a waveguide, modulating the waveguide, and performing preliminary radiation testing of the material. During the Phase II effort, three essential issues will be addressed. These issues are long term optical performance of the chosen substrate, traveling wave electrode design for efficient modulation, and the development of a packaging platform suitable for future space qualification. The high power, fiber coupled phase modulator enables the creation of a device that is not commercially available. There are several NASA applications that will benefit from this technology development. The modulator will find uses in high power lasers systems to provide sidebands onto a carrier signal and lidar systems which utilize high power fiber amplifiers. An additional application is a visible light modulator for locking a laser wavelength to a gas absorption reference. The high optical power capability of the phase modulator provides the primary basis for AdvR to enter the commercial market with this product. The fiber coupled phase modulator provides an alternative to currently available free space coupled phase modulators that can handle similar optical powers, but are bulky and require high drive voltage to operate. Additionally, the fiber coupled modulator is capable of handling significantly higher optical powers than commercially available fiber coupled lithium niobate waveguide phase modulators."

THE ALHAT SYSTEM WILL ENABLE GLOBAL LUNAR ACCESS FOR EXPLORATION OF AREAS ON THE LUNAR SURFACE NEVER BEFORE VISITED, WITHOUT REGARD TO LIGHTING CONDITIONS. THE ALHAT SYSTEM WILL BE CAPABLE OF LANDING A LUNAR DESCENT VEHICLE WITHIN REQUIRED PRECISION AND ACCURACY OF A PRE-DESCENT DESIGNATED LANDING LOCATION. THIS INTEGRATED SYSTEM INCLUDES DEDICATED LANDING SENSORS, COMPUTATIONAL ALGORITHMS, AND AN INTERFACE TO A LANDING VEHICLE COMMAND AND DATA HANDLING SYSTEM THAT ULTIMATELY WILL BE IN CONTROL OF THE LANDING VEHICLE. THE SCOPE OF THE ALHAT PROJECT INCLUDES THE DEFINITION, DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, TEST, VERIFICATION, AND VALIDATION (V&V) OF AN INTEGRATED GUIDANCE, NAVIGATION AND CONTROL (GNC) LUNAR DESCENT AND LANDING SYSTEM CONSISTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVEL (TRL) 6.  THE ALHAT SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO BE APPLICABLE TO A VARIETY OF VEHICLE TYPES, BOTH CREWED AND NON-CREWED. THE AUTONOMOUS LANDING SCENARIOS DRIVE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR LANDING SENSOR ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY (SAFE AND PRECISE). THE CREWED SCENARIOS DRIVE THE NEED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AT VIDEO RATES (1 30 HZ) FOR USE SIMILAR TO A  HEADS UP  DISPLAY TO ALLOW CREW INTERFACE AND TO FACILITATE PROVISIONS FOR MANUALLY CONTROLLED LANDINGS. BOTH SCENARIOS COULD BE ACHIEVED USING A SINGLE INTEGRATED SENSOR SYSTEM, BUT FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN KEY TECHNOLOGIES IS NEEDED FOR MEETING THE ALHAT OBJECTIVES.  TO MEET THE SAFE AND PRECISE LANDING REQUIREMENTS, THE ALHAT SYSTEM WILL MAKE USE OF THE 3-D IMAGING SENSOR DATA TO DETECT AND AVOID POTENTIAL LANDING HAZARDS DURING THE FINAL STAGES OF THE POWERED DESCENT FOR LUNAR LANDING. THE ALHAT SYSTEM LANDING SENSOR AND ASSOCIATED ALGORITHMS WILL BE CAPABLE OF DETECTING AND LOCATING LANDING HAZARDS SUCH AS ROCKS, CRATERS, SLOPES OR OTHER DISCONTINUOUS SURFACE FEATURES. THIS ABILITY TO DETECT AND LOCATE HAZARDS WILL ENABLE THE POTENTIAL FOR TRAJECTORY RETARGETING AND MANEUVERING TO A SAFE LANDING SITE. THE SIMULTANEOUS ACQUISITION AND LOCATION DETERMINATION OF HAZARDS AND CONVERSELY, ACQUISITION AND LOCATION DETERMINATION OF SAFE LANDING SITES, ALONG WITH THE RELATIVE POSITION INFORMATION INHERENT IN THE 3-D IMAGE, WILL ENABLE THE PRECISION NAVIGATION NECESSARY BOTH TO AVOID HAZARDS AND LAND PRECISELY AT THE RETARGETED LOCATION.

Flash Ladar is ideal for determining real-time spacecraft trajectory, speed, orientation, and range to the planet surface, as well as evaluating potential hazards at the landing site. Sloped ground, craters, rocks and surface composition are among the potential hazards. The framing camera"" nature, of Flash LADAR systems, makes them well suited as hazard avoidance sensors for EDL. An existing Phase two effort is fabricating a compact FLVC for delivery to NASA for field testing, however the system is not hardened. A proposed Phase 2 effort would produce a space qualified sensor engine which can be integrated with the system being delivered to NASA. The sensor engine is the break-though enabling technology for the FLVC. This proposed effort will develop techniques to improve the sensors measurement accuracy. ASC will develop improved calibration techniques, improved sensor non-uniformity and improved on-board real time automatic range correction. This will target range resolutions of better than 1cm and range absolute accuracy better than 3cm.

AdvR, Inc will develop a fiber coupled, high power, electro-optically controlled, phase modulator for the NASA Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The device should be capable of phase modulating a 1 W or greater, continuous wave optical signal at multi-gigahertz rates at 1064 nm. The key innovation is the use of a waveguide embedded in a non-linear optical material suitable for high optical power handling. The phase modulators used for LISA must be rugged and must perform optimally in a radiation environment over the mission lifetime. To achieve this goal, the phase modulator development will include a fiber-in-fiber-out design that will readily lend itself to future space qualification for mechanical stability of the package and radiation damage resistance of the non-linear optical material. The Phase I effort successfully established the feasibility of the waveguide approach by achieving high power in a waveguide, modulating the waveguide, and performing preliminary radiation testing of the material. During the Phase II effort, three essential issues will be addressed. These issues are long term optical performance of the chosen substrate, traveling wave electrode design for efficient modulation, and the development of a packaging platform suitable for future space qualification. The high power, fiber coupled phase modulator enables the creation of a device that is not commercially available. There are several NASA applications that will benefit from this technology development. The modulator will find uses in high power lasers systems to provide sidebands onto a carrier signal and lidar systems which utilize high power fiber amplifiers. An additional application is a visible light modulator for locking a laser wavelength to a gas absorption reference. The high optical power capability of the phase modulator provides the primary basis for AdvR to enter the commercial market with this product. The fiber coupled phase modulator provides an alternative to currently available free space coupled phase modulators that can handle similar optical powers, but are bulky and require high drive voltage to operate. Additionally, the fiber coupled modulator is capable of handling significantly higher optical powers than commercially available fiber coupled lithium niobate waveguide phase modulators."

The PLC integrates a frequency doubling element, a waveguide splitter, and phase modulator into a monolithic, waveguide-based device. This technology is important for lidar systems requiring high frequency stability and accuracy. The proposed device, with the proper IR input, will generate the required visible radiation, spectrally formatted for the HSRL seed laser stabilization scheme. The PLC concept advances NASA's lidar systems due to its compact, efficient, and reliable design, thus enabling use on small aircraft and satellites. The key objective in this SBIR Phase II proposal is to develop and incorporate the PLC into a deployable, all fiber-based seed laser system for NASA-LaRC's HSRL cloud and aerosol measurements. POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) In addition to NASA's use in various lidar systems, the PLC has applications in free space communications, metrology, spectroscopy and the medical industry. A number of medical applications such as phase-modulation fluorimetry in bioprocess and clinical monitoring may benefit from this technology. A number of commercial lidar or lidar-like systems will benefit from the insertion of the PLC. These markets, which are presently inadequately accessed, include security, defense, space, forestry, floodplain measurement, land use assessment, bathymetry, robotics and machine vision applications. As costs are reduced, a host of lidar-based applications will emerge, such as smart cruise control, lane change notification, traffic flow and robotic control. Non-lidar applications for the PLC also offer opportunities in medical imaging, therapeutic lasers, fiber optical channel switching, active Q-switching, free space communication. POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The primary customer is NASA Langley's High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) program for aerosol and cloud characterization. The proposed PLC will find multiple uses in other NASA's lidar remote sensing programs, such in altimetry and DIAL lidar in which a waveguide phase modulator is used to stabilize a single frequency seed laser, and also has potential application in spectroscopic measurement techniques. NASA's technology taxonomy has been developed by the SBIR-STTR program to disseminate awareness of proposed and awarded R/R&D in the agency. It is a listing of over 100 technologies, sorted into broad categories, of interest to NASA."

The key innovation in this effort is to combine recently available large, high photorefractive damage threshold, z-cut 5% MgO:LN with novel ridge fabrication techniques to achieve high optical power, low cost, high volume manufacturing of frequency conversion structures. The proposed ridge waveguide structure should maintain the characteristics of the periodically poled bulk substrate, allowing for the efficient frequency conversion typical of waveguides and the high optical damage threshold and long lifetimes typical of the 5% doped bulk substrate.

Led by NASA Stennis Space Center (SSC), the observation of metal atom emission from liquid rocket engine exhausts at sea level conditions has become a highly successful health monitoring technique, but in altitude tests emission intensities are low. SSC developed an atomic absorption system which has provided useful measurements, but improved sensitivity is required. Non-dispersive atomic absorption presents a far simpler, smaller, lower cost alternative to other techniques with comparable spectral resolution and, of particular importance, should allow a more forgiving receiver geometry, so that noise-modulated source light or plume emission can be eliminated."

Both requirements, high-frequency response and resistance to water spray can be accommodated by mounting the pressure sensors flush with the probe surface. We will also conduct research on how gas-ingesting ducts can be incorporated in the design without interference with the measuring capabilities of the probe, and we will provide for the incorporation of Anasphere's CO2 sensor. In the first phase of this effort, we will also explore the market for sensors to measure humidity and other physical quantities recommended by NASA and NOAA that can be incorporated in the base of the air-data probe. Accelerometers, magnetometers, GPS, a computer and other electronic equipment will be included to estimate the rigid-body motion of the platform carrying the probe, and then calculate velocity components with respect to an inertial frame. The final product will be the preliminary design of a stand-alone piece of instrumentation, available for mounting on a platform to measure atmospheric turbulence and the fluxes of different species and thermodynamic quantities."

AeroTech proposes to enhance ATM simulations and the assessment of Performance Based Operations (PBO) by developing an Autonomous Aircraft Decision Making Model for Weather Hazard Avoidance based on the aircraft's weather hazard detection capabilities, ATC constraints, FAA regulations, and operator policies. The model will provide autonomous guidance for aircraft in ATM simulations such as FACET and ACES. PBO and traffic flow schemes can be assessed for any scenario by varying the detection capabilities of simulation aircraft, regulations, and/or policies, and examining deviation decisions, flight paths, safety impacts, and NAS throughput. Phase I will develop and test the Model's methodology and algorithms, and perform a proof of concept study. By the end of Phase II, the Model will have been implemented and tested in ATM simulations, and will enable researchers to improve NAS operations through new traffic flow techniques based on PBO.  "

Improvements to current methods of spacing aircraft could significantly increase airportal capacity, but there is currently limited awareness of wake encounters and information with which to assess spacing in real-time or to design new spacing schemes. AeroTech proposes to improve situational awareness of wake vortices and enhance the prediction of wake vortex transport and decay by developing an In Situ Wake Vortex Encounter Detection and Reporting System (VEDARS). The VEDARS will quantitatively detect wake encounters using flight data; downlink encounter reports in real-time to enhance ATC awareness and enable assessment of spacing schemes; and collect and report meteorological parameters from aircraft for use in wake transport and decay predictions. Additionally, the VEDARS software can process historical flight data to identify prior wake encounters and assess spacing for a given weather day at an airportal. Phase I will develop and test the VEDARS methodology and algorithms, and perform a feasibility assessment. By the end of Phase II, the VEDARS will have been both ground and flight tested, and will be enhancing wake awareness."

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PROPOSED PHASE II PROGRAM WILL BE: 1) ENHANCEMENT OF THE OVERALL SYSTEMS-BASED C3 IMPACTS ANALYSIS BY REFINING THE WEIGHT, COMPRESSED AIR REQUIREMENTS, PROPULSION SYSTEM, FLIGHT PERFORMANCE, ENVIRONMENTAL, COST, AND RELIABILITY IMPACTS ANALYSES AS WELL AS CONDUCTING A MEANINGFUL EXAMINATION OF FIGURE OF MERIT WEIGHTING SCHEMES. 2) LOW SPEED WIND TUNNEL TESTS OF A 3D SEMI-SPAN MODEL WITH INTEGRATED C3 SYSTEMS TO GENERATE AERODYNAMIC DATA THAT INCLUDE INTERACTION EFFECTS AMONG THE CIRCULATION CONTROL DEVICES. 3) EXECUTION OF AN EXPERIMENTAL FLIGHT PROGRAM USING A SUBSCALE CEETA TESTBED THAT ENABLES DIRECT PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS BETWEEN AN AIRCRAFT EQUIPPED WITH C3-BASED HIGH LIFT DEVICES AND AN AIRCRAFT EQUIPPED WITH CONVENTIONAL HIGH LIFT DEVICES AT THE SAME WING LOADING, AS WELL AS EVALUATIONS OF REAL-WORLD ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEGRATING C3 DEVICES INTO A FLIGHT-READY VEHICLE. POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 1500 CHARACTERS, APPROXIMATELY 150 WORDS)  A SYNERGY MAP WAS CREATED THAT LISTED SPECIFIC NASA MILESTONES FOR WHICH THIS PROJECT HAS BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT RELEVANCE. A TOTAL OF 53 SPECIFIC MILESTONES WERE LISTED WITH 33 HAVING DIRECT RELEVANCE AND 20 HAVING INDIRECT RELEVANCE. OF THE TWELVE ARMD PROJECTS, FOUR CONTAINED NO RELEVANT MILESTONES: 1) SUPERSONICS EDL, 2) AGING AIRCRAFT AND DURABILITY, 3) INTELLIGENT INTEGRATED FLIGHT DECK, AND 4) AIRPORTAL. THE SUBSONIC FIXED WING (SFW) PROJECT HAD THE MOST RELEVANCE (22 RELEVANT MILESTONES) FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY THE INTEGRATED RESILIENT AIRCRAFT CONTROL (IRAC) PROJECT (17 RELEVANT MILESTONES). ALSO, NASA''S NEXTGEN WHICH IS BASED ON THE JPDO''S VISION OF THE NGATS HAS FOUR STRATEGIC GOALS, NAMELY: 1) INCREASED CAPACITY, 2) IMPROVED SAFETY AND RELIABILITY, 3) INCREASED EFFICIENCY AND PERFORMANCE, AND 4) REDUCED ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED IN THIS PROJECT DIRECTLY SUPPORTS ALL OF THESE GOALS. POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 1500 CHARACTERS, APPROXIMATELY 150 WORDS)  THERE ARE MANY MILITARY APPLICATIONS OF THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED IN THIS PROJECT.

The research and technology development effort is directed at important trace gases of interest to NASA, including carbon monoxide, ammonia, alcohols and formaldehyde. The goal is low temperature catalytic oxidation and regenerative adsorption, both of which are of high interest. The proposed system is regenerable and expected to have lower equivalent systems mass and improved performance to conventional (activated carbon) systems. Outside of NASA markets include applications for residential and industrial air filtration, pollutions abatement, homeland security and military. The proposed alternative methods for scale-up of the mesh materials have potential for substantially reducing the cost over the initial concept evaluated during the phase I activity. The proposal focuses on an area of high relevance to NASA Constellation Program: spacecraft cabin trace contaminant control. The approach is very novel and involves a CNT covered stainless steel mesh integrated of functionalized with materials to improve its catalytic oxidation properties (for removal of carbon monoxide, alcohols and formaldehyde) and adsorptive properties (for removal of ammonia). The proposed technology exploits the physical properties of CNTs with respect to high electrical and thermal conductivity and surface area to volume ratio. The small business and research institution provides complementary experience and facilities, although neither include specific expertise in atmospheric trace contaminant control. The Phase II effort includes risk in the area of ammonia adsorption, which had less emphasis during Phase I. The survey and discussion of literature could have been improved if it included content on state of the art trace contaminant control systems, atmospheric requirements including spacecraft maximum allowable concentrations (SMAC) of trace gases, and ammonia adsorption."

The interchangeable housings shall be utilized in trade studies to determine the optimal bearing profile and weight relative to the shoulder and arm position. It is assumed that the next generation of NASA pressure suits will require the crewmember to utilize their suit in both the pressurized and unpressurized mode. Historic, key design drivers have always been suited comfort in the unpressurized mode and suit mobility in the pressurized mode. As a minimum, bearings will be needed at the shoulder, bicep, and wrist to satisfy pressurized mobility requirements. To placate unpressurized comfort, the optimal bearing design shall be lightweight and low profile; often conflicting characteristics in bearing design. This SBIR proposal will provide NASA with a bearing design that facilitates quick trade studies to determine the optimal bearing profile and weight."

ANDERSON PROGRAM IS AN INTENSIVE TECHNICAL OUTREACH PROGRAM HELD DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS AT ALABAMA A&amp;M UNIVERSITY. THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO HELP ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE OF U.S. STUDENTS GRADUATING IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING BY ENCOURAGING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO APPRECIATE CAREERS IN ENGINEERING AND TO RECOGNIZE THE CHALLENGES OF AND PROPERLY PREPARE FOR AN ENGINEERING CURRICULUM. THE PROGRAM PROVIDES EXPERIENCES THAT STIMULATE STUDENT INTEREST IN MATHEMATICS, TECHNOLOGY, COMPUTERS AND THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES. IT PROVIDES PERSONAL CONTACTS WITH BOTH ENGINEERING INSTRUCTORS AND UNDERGRADUATE ENGINEERING MAJORS AND PROVIDES CRITICAL CURRICULA INFORMATION FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS. THE 2007 PROGRAM WAS THE THIRD IN WHAT WE BELIEVE WILL BECOME A SUMMER TRADITION AT ALABAMA A&amp;M UNIVERSITY. WE NOW WANT TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM TO REACH STUDENTS NOT ONLY FROM THE HUNTSVILLE AREA BUT FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF ALABAMA AND, EVENTUALLY, NATIONWIDE. WE PLAN TO EXTEND THE PROGRAM TO FOUR WEEKS DURATION AND, FUNDING PERMITTING, BRING STUDENTS TO THE CAMPUS TO STAY IN UNIVERSITY DORMITORIES FOR THE DURATION OF THE PROGRAM. WE WILL ALSO ADD NEW ENGINEERING TOPICS TO OUR CURRICULUM.

The Robotic missions may vary from mapping of lunar surface and in particular landing site , developing habitats for astronauts, carrying cargo from one location to another, assisting the astronauts in scientific missions by collecting samples from lunar surface, exploring undiscovered territories on the lunar surface, and transporting astronauts from one location to another to name a few. The present proposal addresses the possibility of a collaborative effort between NASA, National Instruments and Alabama A&M University for development of a unified network approach for a surface mobility test bed facility at Alabama A&M in which both command and control and other data reside on a single secure network. This architecture which also supports a hierarchical command structure in which teams of robot it common function or mission may be grouped, will employ National Instruments'' LabView and associated hardware.  The facility will be established with the aid of NASA Marshall Space Flight center and will be used to facilitate the robotic efforts in the center. The testbed is primarily comprised of a digital camera, servos, and proximity sensors with an onboard controller. In the first phase of the proposal the surface mobility test is carried out using the teleopertation mode. In the seconds phase, the mobility test bed is extended to include network control in the LabView environment. Algorithms will be developed for autonomous detection of target and chase vehicles, autonomous rendezvous between two vehicles and autonomous docking."

THE DISTRIBUTION OF VOLUME CHANGE ON THE GLACIER IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH A SIMPLE RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE, SUGGESTING A DYNAMIC INSTABILITY CHANGED THE PATTERN OF ICE FLUX. THE BASIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CLIMATE, MASS BALANCE, AND ICE DYNAMICS AT EKLUTNA GLACIER TO BETTER PREDICT FUTURE BEHAVIOR OF THE SYSTEM.

The purpose of this tool is to enable researchers to evaluate novel human-automation systems early in the design process. The tool will leverage the Man-Machine Integration Design and Analysis System (MIDAS, developed for NASA Ames), and provide the MIDAS-FAST (Function Allocation Simulation Tool). In this project, the team will develop a research-based module of human-automation interaction. The team will develop human performance models of scenarios of interest. These models will be based on task analyses performed in cooperation with subject matter experts (SMEs). Various validation studies will be performed throughout this project. The team will validate the task analyses by talk-through sessions with SMEs. Human performance model and human-automation interaction module predictions will be validated in empirical, human-in-the-Ioop studies. Results of the validations will be used to refine the models. One particular focus of the project is on developing a prototype tool that is both usable and useful for researchers, allowing them to easily modify scenarios and evaluate different potential automation conditions. This tool will provide for data entry screens that guide the user through the process of building a scenario. It will allow the researchers to specify numerous relevant factors, e.g., operators, tasks, environmental conditions, and function allocation strategy. It will offer a visualization capability that provides a virtual video of the scenario, showing operators interacting with equipment and each other. The output of the model run will include, in addition to the video file, parameters of interest such as situation awareness, workload, time to initiate tasks, time to complete tasks, and task accuracy."

With the support of NASA's SARA and APRA programs, over the past four years we have made substantial progress in this work. Our work has focused on calculations of 1) ielectronic recombination (DR), 2) fluorescence and Auger yields due to a Is vacancy, and 3) inner-shell photoabsorption. DR is the dominant electron-ion recombination for most ions in cosmic plasmas. Recently our group has completed calculations of DR for the H-like through Na-like isoelectronic series for elements up through Zn, Our theoretical calculations are in good agreement with existing high-resolution storage ring measurements for Fe ions. Accurate fluorescence yield and Auger yield data due to Is vacancies are needed for modeling shocked gas in supernova remnants and X-ray photoionized plasmas. We have completed calculations for the entire second row of isoelectronic series for elements up through Zn, Our results have revealed large errors in the fluorescence/Auger database currently being used by the astrophysicists, and we have elucidated the higher-order effects that are necessary for the proper description of these atomic processes. Accurate photoabsorption cross sections are also required to model properly X-ray photoionizaed plasmas. We have completed calculations for the the photoabsorption of all oxygen and neon ions and have included these data into the modeling of abundances in the ISM and opacities in accretion disks. Unlike existing independent-particle data, our method is ideally suited for modeling the observed X-ray absorption features by also including resonance excitation, Auger broadening, and relaxation effects. We propose to continue our DR, fluorescence, and photoabsorption work. We will extend our DR work to calculate rate coefficients for isoelectronic sequences of the more complicated third row elements. We will also continue calculating new Auger/fluorescence data. In specific, we will investigate lsuelectronic sequences for which multiple electrons and/or photons can be emitted. We will continue research along the lines of inner shell photoabsorption for all ions of carbon, magnesium, silicon and sulfur, working in close collaboration with X-ray modeler colleagues. All of our new atomic data will be made publicly available and will be used by us in the non-equilibrium plasma simulation code CLOUDY to enable more accurate interpretations of ionized mission/absorption line gas. Our work will be relevant to the interpretation of spectroscopic data from a range of past, present, and future satellite observatories including WE, HST, EUVE, ISO, HUT, ORFEUS, Einstein, EXOSAT, ROSAT, ASCA, FUSE, GALEX, NGST, Chandra, XMM, JWST, SIRTF, ASTRO-E2, and Constellation-X."

AM will enhance the current clinical gold standard immunoassay methodology by using its proprietary bead-based aptamer selection process to select dithiophosphate backbone-modified (PS2) thio"" aptamers (PS2-thioaptamers) as replacements for antibodies in immunoassays. The PS2-thioaptamers are binding agents with functionality comparable to antibodies but with very long shelf-life under ambient environment storage. The PS2-thioaptamers bind much more tightly to their targets than regular aptamers without sacrificing specificity, and are much more nuclease resistant. AM's bead-based process allows fast selection and identification of PS2-thioaptamers, which cannot be directly selected using older aptamer technologies such as Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX). AM will demonstrate PS2-thioaptamer integration into a state-of-the-art microfluidics instrument from Sandia National Laboratory that meets NASA's form factor needs for space flight. The Phase I Project will demonstrate detection and quantification of osteocalcin (OC) using a PS2-thioaptamer in a prototype microfluidics device (TRL-4). Phase II will entail completing the panel of biomarkers for bone demineralization and delivering a prototype of the system to NASA. In Phase III, AM and Sandia will deliver a flight test system to NASA and begin FDA validation of the system for potential use in clinical diagnostics of osteoporosis as well as other conditions."""

This continuation project builds upon more than a decade of the ACCESS project, during which AAAS recruited, screened, placed and followed up on a diverse group of talented students with disabilities at 10 NASA sites around the country, and NASA/Headquarters in Washington, DC. The recruitment of a high level of talent and the need for increased diversity of students entering the NASA pipeline has fostered a request by NASA sites for more summer interns with disabilities. This proposal requests funding for placement of a minimum of 20 undergraduate and graduate students with disabilities, majoring in science, mathematics, physics, technology, engineering, and some business areas. The interns will represent diverse cultural, gender, geographic, and academic backgrounds, in nine NASA centers and Headquarters for 10-week summer internships."

Its application is widespread across diverse scientific subjects and disciplines. Over the past 20 years progress in medical physics and biomedical science research has driven substantive technological and methodological advancements in fluorescence based applications. These developments have ensured that fluorescence spectroscopy is now widely utilized in the water sciences. Presently there are a number of active research groups worldwide that are using fluorescence techniques for the investigation of aquatic systems. Such groups represent a diverse user community including scientists / engineers / and policy makers from across a wide range of private and public sectors involved in the monitoring and management of fresh / potable / ground / marine / and waste waters. However advancement of use of fluorescence more broadly by the water science community is hampered a lack of a forum at which the fluorescence community regularly convenes. This has hindered the advancement of knowledge in both water science and fluorescence spectroscopy. This Chapman Conference will address these gaps by bringing groups within this diverse community together to participate in knowledge exchange and knowledge transfer. The overall objective of this conference is to provide a first-ever forum for bringing this diverse group together to discuss community practices for sampling / measurement / and data analysis of fluorescence substances in water. This conference will specifically address the following science questions: a) Learning from different disciplines: inter calibration / standards / and sample handling b) How do environmental factors influence organic matter fluorescence? c) What are the best methodologies for handling large fluorescence datasets? d) What's next? Future directions and novel applications.

AGNC proposes a Health and Maintenance Status Determination and Predictive Fault Diagnosis System (HMSD/PFDS). The fuzzy qualitative model for model-based residual generation and the rule-based evaluation of residuals using neural-fuzzy combination are defined. Intelligent data fusion strategies for health and maintenance determination and predictive fault diagnosis are developed for rocket engine systems/subsystems. The goal is to ensure safety, cost reduction, graceful degradation and re-optimization in the case of failures, malfunctions and damages. Kalman filter based and rule based evaluation of residuals using neural-fuzzy combination are developed. The use of fuzzy qualitative models takes into account the uncertainties associated with behavior descriptions and incorporates available expert failure symptom knowledge to recognize the particular failure features. Actual or simulated rocket engine sensed or derived data are utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the health and maintenance determination and fault prognosis approaches for NASA platforms. Phase I is devoted to the HMSD/PFDS design and simulation. Phase II will result in development of a functional prototype."

The collaboration is a facet of the Education and Public Outreach (EPO) efforts associated with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Mission and the Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND) experiment. The program provides a set of internships for students and fellowships for faculty, sustained over the timeline of the LEND project, with the goal of producing active research groups in the field of space science at the selected campuses. Undergraduates (to be known as NASA/LEND Scholars) at participating institutions will engage in summer internships at GSFC for the duration of the LEND project (2006-09), while their faculty mentors (to be known as LEND Fellows) will visit GSFC for several weeks to famiUarize them with the project and data. One institution selected to participate will also be part of MU-SPIN's Network Resource and Training Site program (NRTS). The students and faculty will work directly with NASA scientists active in the LEND project in the summer, and continue the project when the summer is over. The program is sustained during the academic year by a variety of mechanisms which may include: funding for student research stipends, a new course (or courses) or seminar series in tmdergraduate research developed by the faculty mentor, and travel to appropriate conferences and launch events by student and faculty. As the faculty member gains familiarity and expertise with the science of the mission, she/he then will take on a larger role in the mentorship process, which is another critical ingredient to sustaining the benefits of the program beyond a mere summer internship. The intent is to involve the LEND scholars in the research endeavor until they graduate, and to engage the institution, the SPS chapter and the LEND Fellows in the research process until the mission is completed in 2009."

It shares NASA's goal of observing, understanding, and modeling the Earth system to discover how it is changing, to better predict change, and to understand the consequences for life, Following the best practices of three highly sueeessful AMS DataStreme teaeher-enhaneement courses, a textbook, investigations manual and course website will be produced for delivery nationally via Local Implementation Teams (UTs). Central to the course will be investigations with components written in real time that employ the latest Internet-delivered environmental data and information (many based on NASA products). State University of New York will award three hours academic graduate credit for sueeessful course participation. NOAA will provide operational climate data and in-kind expertise. The ultimate goal is to develop an informed public which recognizes the relevance and impacts of climate and climate change to people's lives and the choices they ean make to mitigate or adapt to adverse effects.

Policy Program services include a National Priority Forum Series (studies examining, successively, specific subject areas such as agriculture, energy, water, transportation, etc. or sub-elements of these; each study built around a forum or workshop); related and ongoing Policy Program work to develop future leaders and to keep policymakers and decision makers abreast of advances in Earth system science; and leveraging of other AMS-wide efforts to foster dialog and coordination among public-, private-, and academic sectors. However, the need for such facilitation is growing more complex and more urgent, requiring attention to long-term, strategic direction as well as particular aspects. Moreover, all sectors require that the facilitation be robust and sustainable over a period of years. The AMS Policy Program is therefore seeking new support from federal agencies and corporations, to accelerate and strengthen such facilitation, and make it more sustainable.

The Space Show will convey cutting-edge scientific research through a powerful immersive educational experience to address the seemingly simple concepts that our Sun is a star, stars develop and change over their lifetimes, and that once there were no stars. Even though many people can tell you that the Sun is a star, how many really understand what that means? Who contemplates their origins in stellar fiimaces or grasps their daily dependence on its energy? Do people associate the stars in the night sky with our everyday Sun? Axe they aware that the seemingly eternal Sun is actually a dynamic body about mid-way through a dramatic life? This show will make those coimections showing the source of the energy and the heavy elements we depend on, and following stars over their lifetimes as they are created, evolve and die. The ambition of this show is to transform viewers'' perceptions of the night sky permanently, so that the next time they see a star, they will see not only the beauty of that tiny point of light, but remember its critical importance to life during the day. The themes and messages of The Stars are pertinent to many NASA programs and missions, including the Living with a Star Program, and the James Webb Space Telescope's goal of imaging the first stars and galaxies. The show aims to demonstrate the importance of the Sun to life on Earth, and place the Sun in the context of stars in general. Emphasis is placed on understanding the interconnectedness of the Earth and the universe and how cosmic forces directly affect life and society. With its thrilling visualizations of real scientific data, compelling storyline, and high production values, The Stars will engage and educate worldwide audiences of all ages and seek to inspire viewers with the thrill of exploration and discovery. The AMNH partnership with NASA Science Mission Directorate, Heliophysics Division has resulted in our newest Space Show, Cosmic Collisions, continuing a distinguished tradition of accuracy in scientific visualizations, which rely on current scientific data and close collaborations with scientists. We expect to maintain our strong commitment to partnerships by convening an international group of collaborating institutions. Building on the experience and success of the Museum's previous three Space Shows (Passport to the Universe, The Search for Life: Are We Alone?, and Cosmic Collisions), leading specialists including Museum scientists, visualization professionals, and an accomplished creative production team will once again join together with NASA to produce The Stars. This show will use advanced 3D computer animation, visualization techniques and technologies combined with expert pedagogy in supporting learning through immersive media and newly developed educational resources."

In particular, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, which is widely used to guide conservation policy and spending, does not explicitly incorporate climate change into its criteria to evaluate extinction risk. We aim to address this shortcoming by developing a modeling framework that links remote sensing of the environment with in situ biological data sets and global climate model predictions. We will couple habitat suitability models (including the Maximum Entropy method, Maxent) with metapopulation simulations (implemented in RAMAS software). These models will link remote sensing products (e.g., land cover classifications, NDVI, EVI, LAI, GPP, NPP, fPAR) with biodiversity data from natural history collections and biodiversity surveys, and future climate scenarios generated for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Our linked modeling approach will enable extinction risks under climate change to be assessed based on both landscape and demographic properties, therefore providing more reliable assessments, subject to fewer uncertainties, than when applying habitat suitability models alone. The principal objectives of the proposed project are to: 1) test the use of remote sensing products alongside in situ biological data and climate data for building habitat suitability models; 2) link habitat suitability models and metapopulation simulations to assess extinction risk under climate change; 3) investigate the impact that including versus excluding remotely sensed data has on assessments of extinction risk; 4) develop guidelines to ensure that remote sensing products are fully integrated into ongoing efforts to incorporate climate change within the IUCN Red List criteria. We will test our approach using the herpetofaunas of the United States (where in situ datasets are relatively abundant) and Madagascar (where data is much more limited) as case studies. Through collaboration with the IUCN, we will produce guidelines and software tools to advance the use of remote sensing products in environmental forecasting that influences policy and resource management. Our project will therefore expand and accelerate the realization of societal benefits from Earth system science."

The model is designed for cventual scale-up and/or replication at other informal science institutions and universities with high school mentoring components. The NASA Science Research Mentoring Program (SRMP) will constitute the career apprenticeship component of a newly dcsigncd K#tilde#16 AMNH scicnce pipeline. SRMP will contribute to NASA's educational mission by providing intensivc training in the Earth and space science contcnt areas emphasizcd by the Science Mission Directorate (SMD), as well as the mentoring, college prep and other supportive tools so esscntial to preparing studcnts for eventual carecrs in the sciences to fulfill NASA's and the rest of the Nation's sciencc workforce needs. The project will pair AMNH educators with AMNH science staff to teach underserved students from New York City. The program will feature five in-dcpth electives, offered twice per year (for a total of 250 slots), including introductory astrophysics, astrophysics research methodologies, the search for habitable planets, stellar evolution, and Earth science and climate change, intcgrating the SMD's Scicnce Questions"" and ""Research Questions"" for Earth Science, Planetary Science, and Astrophysics, such that any student pursing these courses would be exposed to the latest research addressing these questions. Since the courses will be co-taught by the mentors themselves, they will also teach the essential computational skills, technology and other tools necessary to participate in the scientists'' own research projects. Students will participate in the program for 2 years: they will pursue these preparatory courses during the 10th or 11th grade, and their second year, 18 of those who have successfully completed four of the five electivcs will be selected to conduct research in pairs with the Museum scientists who taught and designcd the electives. Students will also attend a hi-weekly research methods course. The Museum will partner with the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies'' New York City Research Initiative (NASA GISS-NYCRI), as well as with the NY STEM Institute, NASA's Center for Optical Sensing and Imaging (COSI) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Cooperative Remote Sensing Science and Technology Center (CREST), three research centers of City College New York (CCNY) that share with NASA the Museum's commitment to encouraging and preparing underrepresented youth to pursue carecrs in the sciences. Through the NY STEM Institute, SRMP participants can take 6-wcek summer courses in AP-Ievel math, chemistry and physics. SRMP students will also be eligible for one of GISS-NYCRJ's, COSI's and CREST's 50 additional summer mentorship slots. [n addition, SRMP students will participate in campus tours, lectures, workshops and other opportunities for program participants to familiarize themselves with the science teaching and research conducted on a university campus. [n sum, over the three-year grant period, AMNH will offer 750 slots in its Earth and Planetary Science electives and 54 on-site mentorship placements, in addition to the hundreds of additional summer offerings of our institutional partners."""

During this time and in collaboration with Dr. D. Barry Coyle, we have designed and developed a 16-20 MJ laser named HOMER, one of the most tested and proven lasers ever. Our members were a primary subset of the team that recently developed a flight version of HOMER. This team won a Goddard 2007 Applied Engineering Technology Division, Science and Technology Advancement Award. The team was headed by D. Barry Coyle, our Goddard colleague [4]. We have also developed a two-head, 100 mJ laser, which has also been frequency stabilized to within 5 MHz over 30 minutes. This laser is the engine"" for a high energy laser to be used in Doppler wind measurements at Goddard. More recently, we have added fiber laser technology to our research efforts. A seeded fiber amplifier has been designed, bread-boarded, and made operational. This proposal outlines the course of research we wish to pursue over the next 3 years working with Dr. Coyle. We identify further developments for our current systems, models we wish to develop, and new laser systems we wish to create."""
