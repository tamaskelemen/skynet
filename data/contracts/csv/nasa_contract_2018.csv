OVER THE PAST DECADE, COSTS FOR DATA STORAGE SYSTEMS AND COMPUTING HAVE BOTH DROPPED EXPONENTIALLY. THIS HAS OPENED THE DOOR FOR BIG DATA PROCESSING USING SPACEBORNE OPTICAL IMAGERY TO CHARACTERIZE LAND SURFACE PHENOMENA IN HIGH-END COMPUTING (HEC; ACRONYMS LIST ON PAGE 21) ENVIRONMENTS. RECENT EXAMPLES INCLUDE GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE, AMAZON WEB SERVICES CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES, NASA EARTH EXCHANGE AND NASA CENTER FOR CLIMATE SIMULATION (NCCS) ADVANCED DATA ANALYTICS PLATFORM (ADAPT). AT THE SAME TIME, A GROWING CONSTELLATION OF COMMERCIAL VERY-HIGH-RESOLUTION (VHR) SATELLITES OFFER GLOBAL 1-2-DAY REPEAT COVERAGE THAT CAN COMPLEMENT NASA EARTH OBSERVING (EO) MISSIONS WITH STEREO AND SUPER-SPECTRAL CAPABILITIES. THROUGH NO-DIRECT-COST LICENSING AGREEMENTS THE NATIONAL GEOSPATIAL-INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (NGA) AND NASA GODDARD SPACEFLIGHT CENTER (GSFC) ARE ACQUIRING PETABYTES OF ARCHIVED DIGITALGLOBE (DG) 0.3 0.5 M PANCHROMATIC AND 2 4 M MULTI-SPECTRAL IMAGERY FROM AROUND THE GLOBE. THE DG ARCHIVE INCLUDES DATA FROM 7 SATELLITES INCLUDING WORLDVIEW-1, 2, 3, 4, QUICKBIRD-2, GEOEYE-1 AND IKONOS-2. PRIOR TO 2008, A LIMITED NUMBER OF EO VHR IMAGES WERE OFTEN USED INDIVIDUALLY FOR EVALUATION AND VALIDATION OVER SMALL AREAS, TO COMPARE TO COARSER RESOLUTION NASA EO DATA BECAUSE THESE DATA WERE SNAPSHOTS IN SPACE AND TIME. NOW, THE DG CONSTELLATION ENABLES REPEAT, CONTIGUOUS COVERAGE OVER LARGE REGIONS. THESE DATA ARE A VALUABLE EO RESOURCE FOR SCALING GLOBAL ECOLOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL PHENOMENA OCCURRING AT SUBMETER SCALES THAT CAN ENHANCE NASA EO SCIENCE THAT OCCURS AT MODERATE TO COARSE RESOLUTIONS. THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO PROVIDE TOOLS AS AN APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE (API) FOR MASS PROCESSING SPATIALLY CONTIGUOUS AND TEMPORALLY CONSISTENT ARCHIVED NASA-GSFC DG VHR DATA THAT CAN ONLY EFFICIENTLY BE PERFORMED ON NASA HEC RESOURCES DUE TO DG-NGA LICENSING LIMITATIONS AND COMPUTATIONAL REQUIREMENTS."

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES ARE TO (1) ELUCIDATE LINKS BETWEEN THE PRODUCTIVITY OF Y-K DELTA ECOSYSTEMS AND REGIONAL-SCALE ATMOSPHERIC AND CRYOSPHERIC CLIMATE DRIVERS; (2) RESOLVE THE SPATIAL EXTENT AND DRIVERS OF LONG-TERM CHANGES IN VEGETATION AND PHYSICAL LANDSCAPE PROPERTIES RELATED TO LANDSCAPE-SCALE DISTURBANCE PROCESSES; (3) CHARACTERIZE CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE OF TUNDRA VEGETATION ACROSS A NETWORK OF LONG-TERM MONITORING PLOTS; AND (4) RELATE THE OBSERVED CHANGES TO LOCAL OBSERVATIONS AND CONCERNS REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE, IMPACTS TO ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, AND COMMUNITY SUSTAINABILITY. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL OCCUR IN THREE PHASES OVER FOUR YEARS. IN 2015, RESEARCH ACTIVITIES WILL FOCUS ON ANALYSIS OF MULTI-DECADAL REMOTE-SENSING DATA TIME-SERIES, AND RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES OF HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGERY. RESULTS OF THE REMOTE-SENSING ANALYSIS WILL BE USED TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A GROUND-BASED DATA COLLECTION EFFORT FOCUSED ON VEGETATION, SOILS, HYDROLOGY, AND PERMAFROST ACROSS ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS NEAR TWO YUPIK POPULATION CENTERS: THE CENTRAL COAST REGION NEAR CHEVAK AND THE YUKON DELTA NEAR EMMONAK.

NASA S WIDE-FIELD INFRARED SURVEY EXPLORER (WISE; WRIGHT ET AL. 2010) SERVES AS A POWERFUL TOOL FOR FINDING NEARBY ULTRACOOL BROWN DWARFS (KIRKPATRICK ET AL. 2011; MACE ET AL. 2013; SCHNEIDER ET AL. 2017). WISE SURVEYED THE WHOLE SKY SIMULTANEOUSLY IN FOUR BANDS WITH CENTRAL WAVELENGTHS OF 3.4, 4.6, 12, AND 22  M (CALLED W1, W2, W3, AND W4) BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2010 WITH THE SENSITIVITY TO DETECT A 250 K BROWN DWARF TO>6 PC AND EVEN A JUPITER ANALOG ORBITING THE SUN TO>0.6 PC. THE WHOLE WISE CATALOG CONTAINS OVER 747 MILLION SOURCES OF ALL KINDS (CUTRI ET AL. 2013). THIS MASSIVE ARCHIVE SERVES AS A CRUCIAL PRECURSOR SURVEY FOR THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE (JWST), TO BE LAUNCHED IN OCTOBER 2018. HOWEVER, SEARCHES FOR OBJECTS WITH LARGE SPACE MOTIONS IN WISE DATA HAVE YET TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FULL DEPTH AND TIME BASELINE OF THE WISE IMAGES. THE LIMITING MAGNITUDES OF THE WISE ALL-SKY CATALOG ARE APPROXIMATELY W1=16.6 AND W2=16.0. YET PROPER MOTION SURVEYS (SCHNEIDER ET AL. 2016) SO FAR HAVE GENERALLY BEEN LIMITED TO OBJECTS WITH W2 MAGNITUDE<14.5. FURTHERMORE, WISE HAS CONTINUED TO SCAN THE SKY IN THE W1 AND W2 BANDS THROUGH THE NEAR EARTH OBJECT WISE-REACTIVATION (NEOWISER) PROJECT. NEOWISER IMAGING THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN RELEASED INCREASES THE TIME BASELINE AVAILABLE IN THE W1 AND W2 BANDS BY A FACTOR #tilde#10; THIS TIME BASELINE HAS NOT BEEN FULLY EXPLOITED IN PUBLISHED BD SEARCHES. TO EFFICIENTLY SCOUR THIS UNEXPLORED DISCOVERY SPACE, WE HAVE LAUNCHED A NEW CITIZEN SCIENCE WEBSITE, BACKYARDWORLDS.ORG (KUCHNER ET AL. 2017). THIS WEBSITE, PART OF THE ZOONIVERSE CITIZEN SCIENCE COMMUNITY TOGETHER WITH GALAXY ZOO, PLANET HUNTERS AND MANY OTHER FLAGSHIP CITIZEN SCIENCE PROJECTS (SEE HTTP://WWW.ZOONIVERSE.ORG), ENGAGES LAYPERSON VOLUNTEERS TO EXAMINE IMAGES FROM WISE TO LOOK FOR HIGH-PROPER MOTION OBJECTS. THIS APPROACH WILL UNLEASH THE FULL POWER OF THE WISE ARCHIVE FOR DETECTING NEARBY BROWN DWARFS, REVEALING OBJECTS PROFESSIONAL SCIENTISTS WOULD OTHERWISE LIKELY NOT SPOT FOR MANY YEARS.

WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE OBSERVED SCATTERING OF THE SHARAD ECHOES THROUGH FOUR TASKS: 1. MAPPING THE SPLD BASAL REFLECTORS USING THE SHARAD AND MARSIS RADAR SOUNDING DATASETS TO ASSESS HOW MUCH OF THE SPLD IS NOT MEASURED BY SHARAD. 2. CALCULATING THE THICKNESS OF LRZ DEPOSITS ACROSS THE SPLD TO DETERMINE THEIR TOTAL VOLUME AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE SCATTERING OF THE SHARAD SIGNAL. 3. LOCATE AND CHARACTERIZE THE DEEPEST SIGNAL PENETRATION IN THE SPLD THROUGH MAPPING THE POWER OF BOTH COHERENT REFLECTORS AND THE SHAPE OF THE FOG SIGNAL WITH DEPTH. 4. MEASURING THE SPLD SURFACE ROUGHNESS USING CTX IMAGE AND CTX DEM DATA. THIS WORK WILL ENHANCE THE SCIENTIFIC RETURN OF THE SHARAD, MARSIS, AND CTX DATASETS; FEW SUCH STUDIES HAVE BEEN LED BY TEAM MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT MISSION CO-IS. RESULTS FROM THE PROPOSED ANALYSES, SUCH AS THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SHARAD SIGNAL ATTENUATION, WILL QUANTIFY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE NPLD AND THE SPLD AND LEAD TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE OF THE PLD CONTROL THEIR EVOLUTION. THESE RESULTS WILL HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EXPECTED BEHAVIOR OF RADAR SOUNDERS ON THE NASA EUROPA CLIPPER AND ESA JUICE MISSIONS TO ICY MOONS."

ALSO, THE REQUIRED ENERGY DEPOSITION RATE IS MUCH HIGHER IN ARS COMPARED TO CORONAL HOLES OR THE QUIET SUN. MANY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT AN ENERGY DEPOSITION MECHANISM MUST BE OPERATING IN THE SOLAR CORONA TO MAINTAIN THE TEMPERATURES OBSERVED. A LEADING THEORY IS THAT THE CORONA IS HEATED BY LARGE NUMBER OF SMALL ENERGY RELEASE EVENTS KNOWN AS NANOFLARES. A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE NUMBER OF NANOFLARES, WITH SUFFICIENTLY HIGH OCCURRENCE RATE, CAN PROVIDE ENOUGH ENERGY TO HEAT THE CORONA. INSTRUMENTATION LIMITATIONS MEAN THAT NANOFLARES ARE NOT OBSERVED DIRECTLY: THEREFORE, MUCH OF THE EVIDENCE FOR THEIR EXISTENCE IS INFERRED FROM OBSERVATIONS AND NUMERICAL MODELING. DETERMINING THE ENERGY DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE RATE OF NANOFLARES IN THE AR CORONA WOULD BE A HUGE STEP FORWARD IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HEATING IN CORONAL PLASMAS. VIALL&KLIMCHUK 2011, 2013, 2014, 2017 HAVE SHOWN THAT THE TIMING OF AR CORONAL EMISSION BRIGHTENINGS IN MULTIPLE CHANNELS OF SOLAR DYNAMICS OBSERVATORY ATMOSPHERIC IMAGING ASSEMBLY (SDO/AIA) FOLLOWS THAT EXPECTED FROM SIMULATIONS OF A NANOFLARE-HEATED CORONA. USING NUMERICAL HYDRODYNAMIC RADIATIVE EMISSION MODEL FOR THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE (HYDRAD)-BASED SIMULATIONS OF AIA EMISSION FOR AN AR, BRADSHAW&VIALL 2016 HAVE SHOWN THAT THE TIMING OF CORONAL EMISSION BRIGHTENINGS IS DEPENDENT ON THE PROPERTIES OF THE NANOFLARE ENERGY DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE RATE. RELATEDLY, IRELAND ET AL. 2015 SHOW THAT AVERAGE POWER SPECTRA P(F) (WHERE F IS FREQUENCY) OF TIME SERIES OF AIA 171  AND 193  AR IMAGES ARE DOMINATED BY POWER LAWS, P(F)#tilde#F^(-Z), Z>0. IRELAND ET AL. 2015 SHOW THAT A DISTRIBUTION OF EXPONENTIALLY DECAYING EVENTS OF EMISSION E ALONG THE LINE-OF-SIGHT (LOS), WHERE N(E)#tilde#E^(-M) AND THE SIZE OF THE EMISSION DEPENDS ON ITS DURATION T SUCH THAT E#tilde#T^K CREATES A POWER LAW POWER SPECTRUM P(F)#tilde#F^-K(2-M). CONSEQUENTLY, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT A DISTRIBUTION OF NANOFLARE EVENTS CAUSES BOTH THE EMISSION POWER-LAW POWER SPECTRUM IN AIA TIME-SERIES AS WELL AS THE OBSERVED BRIGHTENING TIME-LAGS. THEREFORE, WE WILL USE THE AIA EMISSION POWER-LAW POWER SPECTRA AND BRIGHTENING TIME-LAGS IN COMBINATION FOR THE FIRST TIME AS CONSTRAINTS ON THE ENERGY DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE RATE OF NANOFLARES. METHODOLOGY: WE WILL STUDY THE FOURIER POWER SPECTRA OF THE EMISSION GENERATED BY SIMULATED NANOFLARE ENERGY DEPOSITION EVENTS, AND COMPARE THAT TO THE OBSERVED FOURIER POWER SPECTRA FOR THE ARS STUDIED BY VIALL&KLIMCHUK 2012, 2017 AND WARREN ET AL. 2012. WE WILL USE THE ENTHALPY BASED THERMAL EVOLUTION OF LOOPS (EBTEL) AND HYDRAD NUMERICAL MODELS APPLIED TO AR MAGNETIC SKELETONS TO CALCULATE THE EMISSION ALONG THE LOS. THE TOTAL EMISSION MEASURE WILL THEN BE FOLDED THROUGH THE INSTRUMENT RESPONSE OF AIA. BY COMPARING THE OBSERVED AND SIMULATED AIA POWER SPECTRA IN ALL CHANNELS, AND SIMULTANEOUSLY REQUIRING THAT THE OBSERVED AND SIMULATED AIA EMISSION HAVE THE SAME CROSS-AIA CHANNEL TIME-LAG PROPERTIES, WE WILL DISCOVER IMPORTANT NEW CONSTRAINTS ON THE POSSIBLE DISTRIBUTIONS AND FREQUENCY RATES OF NANOFLARES THAT REPRODUCE THE OBSERVED EMISSION. THIS WILL HELP ANSWER A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IN SOLAR PHYSICS - WHY IS THE CORONA HOT?

OUR PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVE OF THE EARTH SURFACE AND INTERIOR PROGRAMMATIC INTEREST: GEOPHYSICAL MODELS AND ANALYSIS SYSTEMS THAT ADVANCE REAL-TIME OR NEAR REAL-TIME GEODETIC PRODUCTS DERIVED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FROM ESTABLISHED INFRASTRUCTURE FOCUSED ON MITIGATION OF GEOHAZARDS. PROCESSING SPACE GEODESY OBSERVATIONS REQUIRES DATA REDUCTION FOR EARTH ROTATION THAT VARIES DUE TO 1) EXTERNAL TORQUES EXERTED BY THE MOON, SUN AND PLANETS, AND 2) MASS REDISTRIBUTION IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND HYDROSPHERE. PROCESSING DEDICATED VERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY (VLBI) OBSERVATIONS AS WELL AS OTHER SPACE GEODESY DATA ALLOWS US TO DETERMINE EOPS FOR THE PAST. HOWEVER, FOR PROCESSING REAL-TIME OR NEAR REAL TIME OBSERVATIONS THE EOPS FOR THE CURRENT INSTANT OF TIME ARE NOT AVAILABLE. THE ESSENCE OF OUR PROJECT ARE TWO ELEMENTS. FIRST, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR COMPUTATION OF THE ANGULAR MOMENT OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND HYDROSPHERE FROM THE FORECAST OF THE NASA GLOBAL MODELING AND ASSIMILATION OFFICE (GMAO) MODELS GEOSFP AND GEOS-FPIT THAT COVER THE TIME PERIOD FROM 2000.01.01 IN THE PAST THROUGH 24-36 HOURS IN THE FUTURE. USING ESTIMATES OF THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM, WE COMPUTE THE EARTH ORIENTATION PARAMETERS BY NUMERICAL INTEGRATION OF LIOUVILLE''S EQUATION STARTING FROM THE LATEST EOP MEASUREMENT TAKEN AS AN INITIAL VALUE. SECOND, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AN INTERNET SERVICE THAT WILL ALLOW A USER TO RETRIEVE THE EARTH''S ROTATION MATRIX AND ITS DERIVATIVES ANYTIME SINCE 1979.01.01 TO 24 HOURS IN THE FUTURE IN A TOTALLY AUTOMATIC FASHION USING THE OPENDAP PROTOCOL. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SUCH A SERVICE IS THAT ALL COMPLEXITY OF ACCURATE EOP PREDICTION ON THE BASIS OF NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS AND DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS WILL BE COMPLETELY CARRIED OUT BY THE REMOTE SERVER AND IT WILL NOT REQUIRE A HUMAN INTERVENTION. THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR REAL-TIME OR NEAR REAL-TIME SPACE GEODESY APPLICATIONS, ALTHOUGH NON REAL-TIME APPLICATIONS WILL BENEFIT FROM AUTOMATION AS WELL. IMPROVED ACCURACY OF EOP PREDICTION USING THE OUTPUT OF NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELS WILL IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF SITE POSITION DETERMINATION, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR REAL-TIME OR NEAR REAL-TIME APPLICATIONS OF GNSS OBSERVATIONS FOR MONITORING STATION POSITIONS FOR DETECTION OF SEISMIC EVENTS AND PROVIDING HAZARD WARNINGS AND MITIGATION OF DAMAGE FROM EARTHQUAKES, VOLCANIC EVENTS, LANDSLIDES, OR TSUNAMI GENERATION.

OUR PRIMARY GEODETIC DATA WILL BE VERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY (VLBI) GROUP DELAYS. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY (1) INCORPORATING INTO OUR DATA ANALYSIS THE NON-GRAVITATIONAL FORCINGS FROM THE LATEST ADVANCED TIDAL AND NONTIDAL OCEANIC MODELS AND ATMOSPHERIC MODELS; (2) IMPROVING THE OCEAN TIDE MODEL AT PSI1 TIDE (CRITICAL BECAUSE ITS FREQUENCY IS SO CLOSE TO THE NDFW FREQUENCY); AND (3) ESTIMATING PARAMETERS OF THE NUTATION TRANSFER FUNCTION DIRECTLY FROM VLBI GROUP DELAYS WITHOUT RESORTING TO INTERMEDIATE TIME SERIES. IN PAST EFFORTS THE PSI1 OCEAN TIDE HAS NEVER BEEN HANDLED CORRECTLY. THIS IS BECAUSE, UNLIKE ANY OTHER TIDE, IT IS FORCED ABOUT EQUALLY BY THE GRAVITATIONAL TIDAL POTENTIAL AND BY RADIATIONAL EFFECTS OF THE ATMOSPHERIC TIDES. WE PROPOSE TO DETERMINE THE PSI1 BAROMETRIC PRESSURE TIDE FROM SEVERAL MODERN ANALYSES AND REANALYSES OF NUMERICAL WEATHER CENTERS. WE WILL BE GUIDED BY AN EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF BAROMETER MEASUREMENTS THAT WE HAVE BUILT UP OVER SEVERAL YEARS AND WHICH WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY USED TO STUDY THE S1 AND S2 AIR TIDES. WE WILL USE THE RESULTING AIR-TIDE MODEL TO FORCE A NUMERICAL OCEAN-TIDE MODEL THAT WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY USED TO STUDY THE S1 OCEAN TIDE. THE RESULTS, COMBINED WITH THE NOMINALLY EASIER GRAVITATIONAL PART, SHOULD RESULT IN A MUCH MORE REALISTIC MODEL OF THE PSI1 OCEAN TIDE THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO MITIGATE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS IN DETERMINING THE STRENGTH AND SHAPE OF THE FCN. WE WILL MODIFY THE WELL-KNOWN NEMO OCEAN MODEL TO COMPUTE OCEANIC ANGULAR MOMENTUM AND BOTTOM PRESSURE ON THE FLY AND TO STORE THESE DATA WITH A TIME RESOLUTION OF ONE HOUR. THE OCEAN DATA, COMBINED WITH PRESSURE AND WIND DATA FROM NUMERICAL WEATHER CENTERS, WILL SUPPLY NEW ANGULAR MOMENTUM CORRECTIONS FOR REANALYSIS OF VLBI NUTATION DATA, AGAIN LEADING TO BETTER DETERMINED FCN PARAMETERS. WE ANTICIPATE THE NEMO DATA WILL BENEFIT A WIDE RANGE OF EARTH SCIENCE STUDIES, NOT JUST OUR OWN. WE PROPOSE TO REANALYZE VLBI GROUP DELAYS FROM 1984 THROUGH PRESENT. WE WILL FIT PARAMETERS OF THE MODEL THAT RELATE THE OBSERVED SPECTRUM TO THE EXTERNAL GRAVITATIONAL EXCITATION EXERTED BY THE MOON, SUN, AND PLANETS AND TO INTERNAL EXCITATIONS CAUSED BY THE OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC DYNAMICS. THE PARAMETERS OF THE MODEL WILL INCLUDE COMPLIANCES SUCH AS DYNAMIC ELLIPTICITY OF THE WHOLE EARTH AND THE CORE, COMPLEX ELASTIC COMPLIANCES, COUPLING AT THE CORE-MANTLE BOUNDARY AND OTHER PARAMETERS. WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBILITY OF INCLUDING AD HOC EXCITATIONS TO EXPLAIN THE RESIDUAL SPECTRUM. FINALLY, WE WILL FIT PARAMETERS OF THE MODEL DIRECTLY TO VLBI GROUP DELAY WITHOUT USING AN INTERMEDIATE SPECTRUM. WE WILL PERFORM A THOROUGH ERROR ANALYSIS AND DETERMINE REALISTIC UNCER"

THIS PROPOSED SYSTEM WILL BE BUILT WITH COMPACT LOW-POWER X-RAY COMPONENTS AND AN INNOVATIVE SYSTEM CONFIGURATION. THIS IMAGING SYSTEM WOULD BE EXPECTED TO BE LESS THAN 10 POUNDS WITH A TOTAL SIZE AS A SHOE BOX. THE SAMPLE COULD BE EITHER ICE OR ROCK. THE COMPACT X-RAY IMAGING SYSTEM HAS A SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL TO BE USEFUL FOR NASA S NEW FRONTIERS AND DISCOVERY MISSIONS CROSS MOST PLANETARY BODIES. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL INNOVATION IS FROM THREE ASPECTS 1. TO LEVERAGES THE RAPID PROGRESS IN X-RAY SOURCE AND X-RAY IMAGING SENSOR FOR BUILDING A COMPACT AND EFFICIENT SYSTEM. TO USE A HYBRID OPTIC SYSTEM TO GET MULTIPLE MONOCHROMATIC AND POLYCHROMATIC BEAMS FOR ENHANCING THE SYSTEM EFFICIENCY AND CAPABILITY IN DATA COLLECTION. 2. TO COMBINE THE BEAM SYSTEM WITH AN INNOVATIVE SCAN MECHANISM FOR YIELDING THE 3D MULTI-SPECTRAL IMAGES WITH RICH INFORMATION ABOUT THE SAMPLES. 3. FURTHERMORE, THIS PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY COULD BE COMBINED WITH OTHER INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS THE MARS CHEMIN SYSTEM, TO FORM A SYNERGY OF THE DUAL/TRIPLE MODALITY. THE PROCESS COULD BE: FIRST TO PERFORM THE NON-DESTRUCTIVE MULTI-SPECTRAL 3D CT IMAGING WITH THE SAMPLES, AND THEN DO THE X-RAY DIFFRACTION (XRD) AND X-RAY FLUORESCENCE (XRF) MEASUREMENTS AFTER THE SAMPLES TO BE GROUNDED TO POWDER. THE SYNERGY WILL YIELD A GREAT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION, SUCH AS DENSITY, POROSITY, CRACK, PHASE COMPOSITION, ETC, AS WELL AS THE CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS, AND TRACE ELEMENTS ETC. OF THE SAMPLES.

THE FLEXIBLE SECTION OF THE RADIATOR IS AN ELASTIC ENVELOPE ENCLOSING A SATURATED WORKING FLUID. WHEN THE TEMPERATURE OF THE RADIATOR INCREASES, THE CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN VAPOR PRESSURE GENERATES A NET FORCE ON THE INTERIOR WALLS OF THE ENVELOPE WHICH CAUSES THE ELASTIC WALLS TO BEND SO THAT THE STRUCTURE OPENS AND THE VIEW FACTOR INCREASES. THE INCREASE IN VIEW FACTOR REDUCES THERMAL RESISTANCE OF HEAT REJECTION WHICH ENABLES INHERENTLY PASSIVE THERMAL CONTROL.

THE SOLID PRODUCT WAS A DRY MATERIAL THAT DID NOT SUPPORT MICROBIAL GROWTH AND WAS HYDROPHOBIC RELATIVE TO THE STARTING MATERIAL. IN THE CASE OF CANINE FECES, THE SOLID PRODUCT WAS A MECHANICALLY FRIABLE MATERIAL THAT COULD BE EASILY COMPACTED TO A SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER VOLUME (#tilde#50%). IN ADDITION, THE TORREFACTION METHOD CAN BE APPLIED USING THE SAME OR SIMILAR CONDITIONS TO OTHER TYPES OF WET SOLID WASTES AND IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE UNIVERSAL WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (UWMS), NOW UNDER DEVELOPMENT BY NASA. THE TORREFACTION PROCESS COULD ALSO BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH MINIMAL CREW INTERACTIONS AND MODEST ENERGY REQUIREMENTS, WHICH COULD BE IMPROVED EVEN FURTHER IN AN OPTIMIZED AND INNOVATIVE PHASE II TORREFACTION PROCESSING UNIT (TPU), WHICH IS THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CURRENT PROPOSAL."

THE PROPOSAL WILL PRIMARILY USE DATA PRODUCTS FROM CRISM, MCS AND MARCI ABOARD MRO. A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION OF THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE IN THE THERMAL AND METEOROLOGICAL MODELING \NECESSARY TO ANALYZE OR INTERPRET THE DATA\"" IN TERMS OF THE WATER AND DUST CYCLES. THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO ADDRESS FOUR MAJOR QUESTIONS: - HOW IS THE LOCAL CYCLE OF WATER (AND DUST) CONTROLLED AT SITES OBSERVED BY CRISM/MCS/MARCI? - CAN SUCH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTROLS ON SURFACE WATER EXCHANGE BE SUMMARIZED INTO A PROGNOSTIC FRAMEWORK LIKE A LAND SURFACE MODEL (LSM) IN TERRESTRIAL STUDIES? - HOW IS THE GLOBAL CYCLE OF WATER AND DUST CHANGED IF BETTER REPRESENTATIONS OF THE POLAR EXCHANGE PROCESSES ARE INCLUDED IN GLOBAL MODELS? - CAN THE SEASONAL PROGNOSTIC PICTURE OF ICE AND DUST DEPOSITION AT THE POLES BE USED TO HELP UNDERSTAND THE FORMATION OF POLAR LAYERED TERRAIN? THE LATTER QUESTION SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE MDAP CALL REGARDING \""NONDATA-ANALYSIS TASKS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE USE OR FACILITATE THE INTERPRETATION OF MISSION DATA\"" AS IT ALLOWS DATA ON CURRENT PROCESSES TO BE USED TO ADDRESS LONGER-TERM QUESTIONS IN MARTIAN CLIMATE DYNAMICS AND GEOLOGY. THE WATER CYCLE IS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE MARTIAN CLIMATE SYSTEM, YIELDING A SIGNIFICANT FEEDBACK ON THE CLIMATE THROUGH ITS EFFECTS ON SURFACE ALBEDO VIA FORMATION OF ICES AND ON ATMOSPHERIC EMISSIVITY AND REFLECTIVITY VIA CLOUDS. CLOUDS ALSO INTERACT WITH THE ATMOSPHERIC DUST DISTRIBUTION VIA THE MICROPHYSICS OF CLOUD PARTICLE EVOLUTION, YIELDING ADDITIONAL MODIFICATION OF ATMOSPHERIC RADIATIVE FORCING. WHILE THE MAJOR PROCESSES OF THE WATER CYCLE, AND ITS INTERACTIONS WITH THE DUST AND CO2 CYCLES, HAVE BEEN SKETCHED IN OUTLINE FOR SEVERAL DECADES, THE SPECIFICS OF HOW THE WATER CYCLE IS CONTROLLED REMAIN UNCERTAIN, E.G. THE IMPORTANCE OF REGOLITH EXCHANGE. THE NATURE OF THE NORTHERN CAP AS A DOMINANT WATER SOURCE AND THAT OF BOTH THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH AS SINKS AGAIN SEEMS CERTAIN IN OUTLINE, BUT THE DETAILS OF HOW THESE SOURCES AND SINKS FUNCTION HAS NOT RECEIVED MUCH ATTENTION AND MAY DOMINATE THE EFFICACY OF HOW THE WATER (AND RELATED CLIMATE) CYCLES ARE CONTROLLED GLOBALLY. CRISM DATA SUGGEST SIGNIFICANT LOCAL CYCLING AND IN SOME CASES BURIAL OF ANNUAL WATER LAYERS, WHICH IS LIKELY THE BASIS FOR POLAR LAYER FORMATION, AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHICH WOULD BE KEY TO UNRAVELING THE RECORD OF CLIMATE STORED IN THESE LAYERS. WE PROPOSE TO USE THE PLANETWRF MODELING SYSTEM TO UNDERTAKE IDEALIZED LOCAL THERMAL / WATER EXCHANGE MODELING OF SPECIFIC SITES OBSERVED BY CRISM, TO UNDERTAKE RESOLVED-SCALE SEASONAL MODELING OF THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CAPS, AND TO UNDERTAKE MULTI-ANNUAL MODELING OF THE CLIMATE SYSTEM USING LSM SCHEMES DEVELOPED WITHIN THIS PROJECT. NEW DATA PRODUCTS FROM CRISM WILL BE DEVELOPED AS NEEDED WITHIN THE ANALYSIS.

THE INVESTIGATION PROPOSED HERE WILL GAIN INSIGHT BY DIRECT ANALYSIS OF THE DATASET, COMPARISON WITH NUMERICAL MODELING (BY MESOSCALE AND LARGE EDDY SIMULATION) OF THE LANDING SITE ATMOSPHERE, AND COMPARISON WITH MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY (MSL) ATMOSPHERIC DATA. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF WEATHER, DUST DEVIL ACTIVITY, AND AEOLIAN PROCESSES ON MARS VIA THE ANALYSIS OF INSIGHT MEASUREMENTS AND THEIR COMPARISON WITH ATMOSPHERIC MODEL PREDICTIONS. THIS GOAL IS ADDRESSED THROUGH FOUR, INTERRELATED INVESTIGATIONS: 1. DETERMINE THE CONTROLS ON THE DIURNAL AND SEASONAL PRESSURE CYCLE. HAVING ATMOSPHERIC DATA AT TWO LOCATIONS (MSL AND INSIGHT) IS VERY VALUABLE. MSL IS AT A SIMILAR LONGITUDE AND ONLY 9DEG AWAY IN LATITUDE, BUT WITH VERY DIFFERENT LOCAL TOPOGRAPHY AND IN THE OPPOSITE HEMISPHERE, HENCE REGULAR MSL PRESSURE MONITORING MAY BE COMBINED WITH CONTINUOUS INSIGHT MONITORING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF DIFFERENT CIRCULATION COMPONENTS (FROM THE CO2 CYCLE AND HADLEY CELL TO TIDES AND TRAVELING WAVES TO CRATER TOPOGRAPHY) TO THE SEASONAL AND DIURNAL PRESSURE CYCLES. 2. UNDERSTAND REGIONAL FLOWS NEAR THE DICHOTOMY BOUNDARY. ALTHOUGH MSL''S WIND SENSOR IS NO LONGER IN USE, THE SEASONAL RECORD OF WINDS IN GALE WILL BE COMPARED WITH INSIGHT WINDS TO BUILD A BETTER PICTURE OF THE REGIONAL FLOW IN THIS AREA. COMPARISON WITH MODELS WILL BE USED TO ASSESS THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE HADLEY OVERTURNING CIRCULATION, DICHOTOMY BOUNDARY SLOPE FLOWS, TIDAL FLOWS, ETC. TO THE PATTERN OF WINDS IN THIS REGION. 3. UNDERSTAND VORTEX ACTIVITY. SHORT, DEEP PRESSURE DROPS WILL BE USED TO INDICATE CONVECTIVE VORTEX PASSAGE. THEIR DEPENDENCE ON TIME OF DAY AND SEASON ARE IMPORTANT FOR CONSTRAINING OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE BOUNDARY LAYER WHERE THEY FORM AND ALSO VITAL TO UNDERSTAND A MAJOR MECHANISM OF DUST LIFTING. AN IN SITU DATASET OF BOTH VORTICES AND THE ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS IN WHICH THEY FORMED, AT ONE LOCATION OVER MULTIPLE SEASONS, WILL BE INVALUABLE BOTH FOR UNDERSTANDING THEIR DEPENDENCE ON ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS AND FOR VALIDATING MODELS AND THEORIES OF VORTEX PRODUCTION AND DUST DEVIL-BASED DUST LIFTING. BOTH MESOSCALE AND LES MODELING WILL BE USED TO PREDICT VORTEX ACTIVITY, WITH A COMPARISON WITH OBSERVATIONS USED TO INDICATE DEFICIENCIES IN THE MODELS OR THEORY. 4. MONITOR AEOLIAN ACTIVITY AND INFER THRESHOLDS FOR PARTICLE MOTION. WIND DATA WILL BE COMPARED WITH A) TEMPORAL CHANGES IN AEOLIAN FEATURES AND B) CHANGES IN SURFACE SOIL, DECK, OR SOLAR PANEL DUST COVER BETWEEN TWO IMAGES, IN ORDER TO INFER PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT, SUCH AS THE THRESHOLD FOR SALTATION. AEOLIAN FEATURE CHARACTERISTICS WILL ALSO BE PREDICTED USING WIND DATA AND MODEL OUTPUT AND COMPARED WITH OBSERVATIONS TO ASSESS AEOLIAN THEORY AND MODEL PERFORMANCE. THE PI HAS SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE IN WORKING ON SUCH INVESTIGATIONS AS A MEMBER OF THE MSL SCIENCE TEAM [E.G. BRIDGES ET AL., 2017]. THE PI WILL PARTICIPATE STRONGLY IN THE ATMOSPHERE THEME GROUP, AS SHE DOES IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL THEME GROUP ON MSL, AND ALSO IN THE GEOLOGY THEME GROUP, TO E.G. HELP INTERPRET / DISSEMINATE METEOROLOGICAL DATA AND PROVIDE INPUT INTO WHEN HIGHER RESOLUTION DATA SHOULD BE SOUGHT. THE PI IS AN ASSOCIATE TEAM MEMBER ON REMS AND A CO-I ON THE MARS ENVIRONMENTAL DYNAMICS ANALYZER ON MARS2020, WITH STRONG EXPERTISE IN WORKING WITH MARS IN SITU ATMOSPHERIC DATA IN GENERAL, AND IN PARTICULAR WITH THE WIND SENSORS TO BE FLOWN ON INSIGHT. THIS INVESTIGATION IS RELEVANT TO THE INSIGHT MISSION AND PROGRAM BECAUSE IT WILL \EXPAND ON OR ENHANCE THE SCIENCE RETURN OF THE INSIGHT PROJECT\"" AND INCREASE OUR ABILITY TO \""BETTER UNDERSTAND MARTIAN METEOROLOGY.\"""""

THE MAJORITY OF THIS WORK WAS DEVOTED TO ACHIEVING HIGH TEMPERATURES TO SUPPORT, FOR EXAMPLE, SOLAR FURNACE OPERATION, BUT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION WAS DIRECTED TO COOLING. COATINGS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO ALLOW A SURFACE IN SUNLIGHT TO COOL BELOW AMBIENT, BUT ATMOSPHERIC LIMITATIONS, INFRARED TRANSMISSION WINDOWS AND CONVECTIVE WARMING, PREVENT SIGNIFICANT COOLING. HOWEVER, HIBBARD, OF THE LEWIS RESEARCH CENTER, REALIZED THAT IN SPACE, AWAY FROM THESE ATMOSPHERIC LIMITATIONS, THAT SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER COOLING COULD BE ACHIEVED. SINCE THEN, A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TESTING HAS BEEN COMPLETED ON MANY DIFFERENT COATING MATERIALS. THE RESULTS OF THIS TESTING SHOW THAT WHEN COMBINED WITH MULTI-LAYER INSULATION TO SHIELD FROM EARTH RADIATION, IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO PASSIVELY COOL A COMPONENT TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOW TEMPERATURES. THESE TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO PASSIVELY STORE CRYOGENS IN SPACE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.  CUBESATS RECENTLY HAVE BECOME POPULAR IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY.

ACHIEVING HIGH THERMAL EFFICIENCIES AND RELIABILITY WHILE MAINTAINING VOLUMETRIC AND MASS EFFICIENCY HAS BEEN THE KEY CHALLENGE WITH THESE KINDS OF REFRIGERATION/FREEZING SYSTEMS IN A MICROGRAVITY ENVIRONMENT. PREVIOUS STATE OF THE ART REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE ISS RFR, USE THERMOELECTRIC THERMAL CONTROL WITH VERY LOW OVERALL SYSTEM COP OF AROUND 0.36 (IN FREEZER MODE). ALTERNATIVELY, TERRESTRIAL COLD FOOD STORAGE SYSTEMS UTILIZE MUCH MORE EFFICIENT VAPOR COMPRESSION THERMAL CONTROL SYSTEMS, MAKING THE SYSTEMS LIGHTER AND MORE COMPACT. CURRENTLY, THESE SYSTEMS DO NOT HAVE PROVISIONS TO FULFILL THE LOAD AND RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS OF SPACE APPLICATIONS AND ARE ALSO NOT DESIGNED FOR MICROGRAVITY OPERATION. AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE KELVINATOR KCCF220QW CHEST FREEZER. THIS FREEZER CAN MAINTAIN TEMPERATURES AS LOW AS 26 C AT COPS OF AROUND 2.2 TO 2.4. AIR SQUARED IS PROPOSING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A ZERO-GRAVITY VAPOR COMPRESSION REFRIGERATOR (ZVCR). THE ZVCR IS AN OIL-FREE, SCROLL DRIVEN, VAPOR COMPRESSION FOOD STORAGE SYSTEM THAT IS THERMALLY EFFICIENT, LIGHTWEIGHT AND RELIABLE. SIMILAR TO CONVENTIONAL SYSTEMS, THE ZVCR WILL INCLUDE FOUR MAJOR COMPONENTS: COMPRESSOR, CONDENSER, EXPANSION DEVICE AND EVAPORATOR. BUT, INSTEAD OF A HEAVY AND OIL LUBRICATED WORKING FLUID COMPRESSOR, IT WILL USE AN ADVANCED OIL-FREE ORBITING TYPE SCROLL COMPRESSOR AND EXPANDER DEVELOPED BY AIR SQUARED. ITS OIL-FREE DESIGN WILL REMOVE SYSTEM S OPERATIONAL RELIANCE ON GRAVITY WHILE KEEPING THE DESIGN COMPACT&LIGHTWEIGHT AT HIGHER EFFICIENCIES. FOR EXPANSION WORK RECOVERY, A SCROLL EXPANDER BASED ON THE SAME TECHNOLOGY AS THE COMPRESSOR WILL BE USED TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE SYSTEM S PERFORMANCE. CUSTOM HEAT EXCHANGERS WILL BE DESIGNED FOR EFFICIENT OPERATION IN MICROGRAVITY WHILE CONSIDERING THE SIZE, WEIGHT AND RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS."

THE PRIMARY GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A VERSATILE PROOF OF CONCEPT CSSP, CAPABLE OF PUMPING LIQUID OR TWO-PHASE METHANE OR OXYGEN AT A WIDE RANGE OF SPEEDS (I.E. 1,000-8,000 RPM) AND A WIDE RANGE OF DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURES WHILE MAINTAINING HIGH-RELIABILITY AND A COMPACT SIZE. THE PUMP WILL BE CONFIGURABLE, TO ALLOW MULTIPLE PUMPS TO BE PLACED IN SERIES FOR HIGH-PRESSURE MULTI-STAGE OPERATION. DURING PHASE I, AIR SQUARED SUCCESSFULLY DESIGNED, FABRICATED AND TESTED A PROTOTYPE CSSP ON LIQUID NITROGEN. FOR CRYOGENIC PUMPING, STATE OF THE ART (SOA), CONSISTS OF TWO VASTLY DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY OPTIONS. CENTRIFUGAL TURBOPUMPS AND POSITIVE DISPLACEMENT PUMPS. TURBOPUMPS UTILIZE AN IMPELLER-INDUCER COMBINATION THAT RELIES ON HIGH IMPELLER SPEEDS TO CREATE A DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE. WHILE THE HIGH-SPEED OPERATION MAKES TURBOPUMPS COMPACT, IT ALSO LIMITS BEARING LIFE, DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE, AND THEY CAN''T HANDLE TWO-PHASE FLOW. POSITIVE DISPLACEMENT PUMPS CAN HANDLE LARGER PRESSURE DIFFERENTIALS AND DON''T HAVE ISSUES WITH TWO-PHASE FLOW. HOWEVER, THEY CAN''T ACHIEVE SPEEDS OVER 3,000 RPM WITHOUT BULKY AND HIGH-LOAD BEARINGS MAKING THEM LESS DESIRABLE FOR AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS. THE CSSP OFFERS THE BEST OF BOTH OPTIONS. AS A POSITIVE DISPLACEMENT PUMP, IT CAN ACHIEVE HIGH-PRESSURES WITH MINIMAL REDUCTION IN FLOW AND PUMP SATURATED LIQUIDS AT LOW NET-POSITIVE SUCTION HEADS. DUE TO THE SPINNING MOTION OF THE PUMP, VARIOUS CENTRIFUGAL LOADS ARE ELIMINATED ALLOWING SPEEDS OVER 8,000 RPM POSSIBLE AND MAKING THE DESIGN COMPACT AND LIGHTWEIGHT. ADDITIONALLY, THE SPINNING MOTION OF THE SCROLLS ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR A COUNTERBALANCE COMMON IN ORBITING SCROLL DESIGNS. THIS FURTHER REDUCES WEIGHT BY ELIMINATING COUNTERWEIGHTS AND EASES BEARING LOADS. AIR SQUARED BELIEVES THE PROPOSED CSSP IS A PERFECT FIT IN SUPPORT OF METHANE IN-SPACE PROPULSION."

THIS PROJECT INVOLVES ANALYZING IMPACT GLASSES FROM SELECTED APOLLO 14, 15, 16, AND 17 REGOLITH SAMPLES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE MORE DATA THAT CAN BE USED TO EVALUATE THE NATURE OF THE LUNAR IMPACT FLUX. DECIPHERING THE LUNAR IMPACT HISTORY IS A COMPLEX PROCESS AND MANY TYPES OF SAMPLES ARE BEING STUDIED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. LUNAR IMPACT GLASSES ARE NUMEROUS; THEIR COMPOSITIONS TELL US WHERE THEY WERE FORMED, WHILE THEIR 40AR/39AR AGES TELL US WHEN THEY WERE FORMED. THUS, LUNAR IMPACT GLASSES CAN PROVIDE USEFUL INSIGHT INTO THE IMPACT RATE IN THE EARTH-MOON SYSTEM. HUNDREDS OF LUNAR IMPACT GLASSES HAVE BEEN SELECTED FROM SAMPLES 14259, 15221, 64501, 66041, AND 71501. COMPOSITIONS AND AGES OF THESE GLASSES CAN BE USED TO CONSTRAIN THE TIMING OF THE LUNAR IMPACT FLUX. METHODOLOGY: MAJOR- AND TRACE-ELEMENT ANALYSES ON THE LUNAR GLASS SAMPLES WILL BE DONE BY ELECTRON MICROPROBE AND LASER ABLATION ICPMS, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE THE ARGON ISOTOPES WILL BE MEASURED BY THE THERMO ARGUS VI MULTI-COLLECTOR NOBLE GAS MASS SPECTROMETER AT CURTIN UNIVERSITY. THIS STATE-OF-THE-ART INSTRUMENT HAS HIGH SENSITIVITY AND IS PARTICULARLY WELL-SUITED FOR ISOTOPIC ANALYSES OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF ARGON. WE WILL THEN COMPARE OUR NEW RESULTS TO EXISTING DATA, WITH THE GOAL OF ADDING TO THE 40AR/39AR DATA SETS OF LUNAR SAMPLE AGES IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF LUNAR IMPACTS OVER TIME. RELEVANCE: LUNAR GLASSES PROVIDE COMPOSITIONAL INFORMATION, WHICH IS USEFUL FOR CHARACTERIZING THE CHEMICAL AND MINERALOGICAL FEATURES OF THE LUNAR SURFACE. AGES OF IMPACT GLASSES CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT RATE IN THE EARTH-MOON SYSTEM (AND PERHAPS THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM), A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IN LUNAR SCIENCE.

THE VERY SUCCESSFUL NASA LED X-43A HYPERSONIC FLIGHT PROVED THE ABILITY TO USE STATE OF THE ART (SOTA) 2D C-C WITH OXIDATION COATING SYSTEM. HOWEVER, CURRENT MATERIAL SYSTEMS CAN ONLY OFFER LIMITED TEMPERATURE CAPABILITY (<3000  F) AND MOSTLY FOR SINGLE USE APPLICATION. IN PHASE I, TWO INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, UNDERCOAT AND FGM MULTI-LAYER COATS, WERE DEVELOPED AND SCREENED. THEY WERE FURTHER INTEGRATED INTO TWO SOTA C-C COMPOSITES. OXIDATION PROTECTED C-C SAMPLES WERE TORCH TESTED AT 3500 F/ 30 MINUTES, AT 4200 F/ 2 MINUTES UP TO 10 CYCLES, AND AT 3000 F/COOL/ 4000 F CYCLES SHOWING VERY PROMISING RESULTS. THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF THE UNDERCOAT AND FGM SPRAY COATS PROVIDE REPEATABLE PERFORMANCE BY CREATING A GLASS FORMING, CONFORMING AND ADHERENT EXTERNAL COATING TO PROTECT THE C-C FROM BEING OXIDIZED. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED P-II IS TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND OPTIMIZE A ROBUST, TAILORABLE, AND AFFORDABLE OXIDATION PROTECTION SYSTEM FOR C-C TPS AND C-C HOT STRUCTURE BY INTEGRATING OUR UNDERCOAT AND FGM MULTI-LAYER SPRAY COAT TECHNOLOGIES INTO AT LEAST TWO GRADES C-C COMPOSITES (T300 AND P30 2D C-C) MEETING HIGHER TEMPERATURE PERFORMANCE UP TO 4500 F AND MULTI-USE APPLICATIONS. WORK PLAN INCLUDES 12 TASKS OVER 24 MONTH GROUPED INTO 5 CATEGORIES. ONCE FURTHER OPTIMIZED AND VALIDATED UNDER PHASE II, THESE TECHNOLOGIES CAN EASILY BE INTEGRATED INTO SOTA C-C USING CURRENT MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. THE RESULTING OXIDATION PROTECTED C-C COULD BE TAILORABLE, AFFORDABLE, AND EASILY SCALED UP FOR LARGE COMPONENTS OR STRUCTURE REQUIRED IN FUTURE NASA, DOD AND COMMERCIAL SPACE APPLICATIONS."

THE WELL-ESTABLISHED SIC-BASED (CVD, PACK CEMENTATION) TECHNOLOGIES CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ALSO HAVE UPPER TEMPERATURE LIMITS AROUND 3000 F, IMPOSING STRINGENT LIMITATIONS ON INCREASED PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM LEVEL CHANGES (I.E. HOTTER PROPELLANT) FOR FUTURE NASA MISSIONS. IN ADDITION, THE INTRINSIC CTE MISMATCH BETWEEN C-C SUBSTRATE AND REFRACTORY CARBIDES/OXIDES FURTHER LIMITS THE USE OF MANY OTHER CLASSICAL COATING TECHNOLOGIES. THE SUCCESSFUL PHASE I RESULTS ESTABLISHED THE FEASIBILITY OF OVERCOMING THESE LIMITATIONS THROUGH THE USE OF A NOVEL, FUNCTIONALLY GRADED (FGM) COATING TECHNOLOGY. THE PROPOSED PHASE II BUILDS ON THE SUCCESS OF THE PHASE I PROGRAM AND CLEARLY INCREASES ITS TRL BY OFFERING SUBSCALE COMPONENT TESTING AT REPRESENTATIVE ENGINE CONDITIONS. A SUCCESSFUL PHASE II PROGRAM WILL CLEARLY OFFER A NEW DIMENSION IN THE NOZZLE EXTENSIONS BY OFFERING DIFFERENT COATING SYSTEMS FOR MULTI-CYCLE CAPABILITY AT TEMPERATURES FROM 3000 F UP TO 4000 F. THE EXPECTED ABILITY OF THE COATING TO SURVIVE SUCH AN AGGRESSIVE TESTING COMBINED WITH THE SUFFICIENT RETENTION OF MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OFFERS A DIRECT PATH FOR A PHASE III WITH MANY OF THE COMMERCIAL SPACE PAYLOAD COMPANIES. THE OVERALL APPROACH IS BASED UPON A MULTI-PIECE C-C NE CONCEPT, WHICH FOCUSES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE OXIDATION PROTECTION TO SMALLER DIAMETERS OF THE NOZZLE EXTENSION (E.G. A CONE), ALLOWING THE CVD COATING TECHNOLOGY TO REMAIN WITHIN CURRENT SOTA CVD CAPABILITIES. LARGER DIAMETER SEGMENTS, WHICH ARE EXPOSED TO LOWER TEMPERATURES, WILL UTILIZE NON-CVD LOWER COST TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS WELL SUITED FOR LARGE DIAMETER COMPONENTS.

THE ADC DOES NOT EMPLOY TIME-INTERLEAVING AND PROVIDES A VERY WIDE SPUR FREE INPUT BANDWIDTH MAKING IT MORE SUITABLE TO NASA''S REMOTE SENSING MISSIONS AND A VARIETY OF RADIO ASTRONOMY APPLICATIONS THAN ANY OTHER ADC AVAILABLE. IN ADDITION, THE ADC WILL BE RADIATION HARD (>300KRAD) AND THUS SUITABLE FOR USE ON-BOARD SPACE MISSIONS. A KEY INNOVATION IN ALPHACORE''S APPROACH TO THE ADC DESIGN IS THAT WE HAVE CONSIDERED HOW THE ADC WILL BE USED IN A SYSTEM; A CUSTOM DESIGNED DIGITAL BACK-END IMPLEMENTS DIGITAL DATA DE-MULTIPLEXING AND SIGNAL CONDITIONING TO ALLOW SEAMLESS INTEGRATION WITH COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE, HIGH-END, FIELD PROGRAMMABLE GATE ARRAYS (FPGA) THAT ARE THE MAIN BUILDING BLOCKS OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC SPECTROMETERS AND INTERFEROMETERS. ALPHACORE''S ADC PROVIDES THESE IMPROVEMENTS AT MUCH LOWER POWER AND LOWER COST THAN EXISTING COMMERCIAL ADCS THAT USE OFF-CHIP COMPONENTS TO PROVIDE THESE FEATURES. ALPHACORE''S DESIGN TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE LATEST LOW-POWER, HIGH-SPEED DIGITAL CMOS PROCESSES, RESULTING IN ADC POWER CONSUMPTION THAT IS LESS THAN 1/8 OF THE POWER CONSUMPTION OF COMPETITOR ADCS. THE PROPOSED ADC EMPLOYS AN INNOVATIVE TOPOLOGY WITH HIGH-BANDWIDTH FRONT-END SAMPLING CIRCUIT COMBINED WITH AN INTERPOLATED FLASH-TYPE ADC AND ENCODER CIRCUITRY THAT SIMPLIFIES FPGA INTERFACING. ALL THE NEEDED CLOCK SIGNALS ARE GENERATED FROM A LOW-COST 100MHZ CRYSTAL CLOCK REFERENCE WITH A LOW-JITTER (<200FS), RADIATION-TOLERANT ON-CHIP PLL."

WHILE SPACE ROBOTS FOR SATELLITE SERVICING HAVE EMBRACED THE USE OF ROBOTIC TOOL CHANGERS, PLANETARY SCIENCE ROBOTICS SYSTEMS HAVE HISTORICALLY AVOIDED THE USE OF TOOL CHANGERS, BECAUSE TRADITIONAL TOOL CHANGERS USE COMPLEX MECHANICAL LATCHING MECHANISMS WITH MANY EXPOSED MOVING PARTS, WHICH ARE OFTEN MECHANICALLY UNRELIABLE IN DUSTY ENVIRONMENTS. TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS, AND ENABLE PLANETARY SCIENCE MISSIONS TO SWITCH FROM USING MASSIVE, COMPLEX, AND BULKY MULTI-TOOL TURRET DESIGNS, ALTIUS PROPOSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ELECTROPERMANENT MAGNETIC TOOL CHANGER, WHICH HAS NO EXTERNALLY EXPOSED MOVING PARTS. THIS PROPOSED EPM TOOL CHANGER CONCEPT USES A SOLID STATE SWITCHABLE MAGNETIC LATCHING SYSTEM TO HOLD THE TOOL TO THE TOOL CHANGER, AND NON-CONTACT POWER AND DATA TRANSMISSION. AND WHILE IT IS NOT IN THE SCOPE OF THE PROPOSED PHASE I/II EFFORT, THIS TOOL CHANGER DESIGN CAN ALSO ENABLE THE USE OF A CONTACTLESS MECHANICAL TOOL-DRIVE COUPLING SYSTEM, ENABLING MECHANICAL TOOL DRIVE WITHOUT EXPOSED MOVING PARTS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE INTERFACE. DURING PHASE I, ALTIUS WILL WORK WITH NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE ROBOTICS TEAMS TO IDENTIFY AND DOCUMENT SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS, AND THEN ALTIUS WILL DESIGN, BUILD, AND PROTOTYPE THE MAGNETIC CONNECTION SYSTEM AND THE WIRELESS POWER/DATA TRANSFER SYSTEMS. THIS TESTING, WHICH WILL INCLUDE PRELIMINARY DUSTY ENVIRONMENT TESTING WILL RAISE THE TRL OF THE POWER/DATA VERSION OF THE EPM TOOL CHANGER FROM TRL 2 TO TRL 4, ENABLING A FLIGHT-GRADE PROTOTYPE OF THE POWER/DATA EPM TOOL CHANGER TO BE DESIGNED, BUILT, AND QUALIFIED DURING PHASE II, RAISING THE SYSTEM TO TRL 6, WHERE IT IS MATURE ENOUGH TO BE INTEGRATED INTO FUTURE NASA AND COMMERCIAL MISSIONS."

ALL OF THESE ABILITIES REQUIRE THE ABILITY TO TRANSFER LARGE QUANTITIES OF CRYOGENIC LIQUIDS (OXYGEN, HYDROGEN, AND METHANE) BETWEEN TANKS ON SEPARATE VEHICLES. WHILE ALL CRYOGENIC ROCKET STAGES HAVE TO HAVE A PROPELLANT FILL/DRAIN COUPLING FOR LOADING PROPELLANT ON THE GROUND, EXISTING DESIGNS ARE NOT CAPABLE OF IN-SPACE REFUELABILITY.

THEREFORE, THIS PROJECT WILL CONSIST OF INTERRELATED WORKSHOPS AND COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES THAT BUILD UPON ONE ANOTHER OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD. THE NEED FOR ADVANCES IN EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND SCIENCE IS GROWING MORE URGENT AS BOTH OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS RELATED TO THE EARTH SYSTEM BECOME MORE COMPLEX. THE COMBINATION OF ACTIVITES PROPOSED HERE WILL HELP PROVIDE THE LONG TERM, STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND CAPACITY BUILDING NEEDED FOR ADVANCEMENT.

SUCH ANALYTIC TOOLS MUST ALSO BE STREAMLINED AND READILY MASTERED BY RESEARCHERS MAKING SCIENTIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS. IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL CREATE SOFTWARE TO ASSESS BIODIVERSITY CHANGE INDICATORS BY BUILDING ON THE RECENTLY DEVELOPED SOFTWARE WALLACE AS A NEW GEO BON IN A BOX TOOL. WALLACE IS AN R-BASED APPLICATION WITH A GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE THAT SUPPORTS SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELING (SDM) IN A REPRODUCIBLE, FLEXIBLE AND EXTENSIBLE PLATFORM TO FACILITATE A WIDE RANGE OF ECOLOGICAL ANALYSES. THESE MODELS CHARACTERIZE ENVIRONMENTAL SUITABILITY FOR SPECIES AND CAN BE USED TO ESTIMATE SPECIES  GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS  A GEO BON ESSENTIAL BIODIVERSITY VARIABLE (EBV).

THE SECOND PACKAGE WILL ALLOW CALCULATION OF KEY INDICATORS INCLUDING SINGLE-SPECIES BIODIVERSITY CHANGE INDICATORS SUCH AS RANGE SIZE, EXTENT OF OCCURRENCE, PERCENT SUITABLE LAND COVER, OR PROJECTED TRENDS UNDER FUTURE SCENARIOS AT MULTIPLE SPATIAL EXTENTS. CALCULATIONS WILL ALSO INCLUDE MULTI-SPECIES INDICATORS, SUCH AS THE EBV TAXONOMIC DIVERSITY, AND OTHERS NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED THROUGH OTHER BON IN A BOX TOOLS, WITH A FOCUS ON ONES MOST USEFUL AT REGIONAL SCALES. MODULE OUTPUTS FROM WALLACE WILL BE DESIGNED TO FEED DIRECTLY INTO OTHER BON IN A BOX TOOLS, SUCH AS OUR INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATOR INSTITUTO HUMBOLDT S BIOMODELOS. BIOMODELOS IS A WEB APPLICATION ENABLING EXPERT VALIDATION OF SPECIES RANGE ESTIMATES IN SUPPORT OF THE COLOMBIA BON. WE WILL ALSO DEVELOP TRAINING MATERIALS FOR WALLACE TARGETING CONSERVATION PRACTITIONERS THAT REFLECT BEST PRACTICES FOR USING SDM FOR BIODIVERSITY CHANGE INDICATOR CALCULATIONS, RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION DECISION-MAKING. OUR PROJECT RESULTS WILL ADDRESS CHALLENGES TO OVERCOMING THE GAP BETWEEN BEST MODELING PRACTICES AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION DECISION-MAKING AND WILL FACILITATE RESPONSIBLE REPORTING ON BIODIVERSITY BY NATIONAL BONS. VIA FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND ENHANCEMENT OF OPEN-SOURCE, USER-FRIENDLY SOFTWARE TO CONTRIBUTE TO BON IN A BOX, OUR PROPOSAL WILL ADVANCE BROAD APPLICATION, EXPLORATION, VISUALIZATION, AND UNDERSTANDING OF EBVS AND GENERATION OF EBV DATA. FURTHERMORE, DEVELOPING A CONNECTION BETWEEN WALLACE AND BIOMODELOS, ANOTHER BON IN A BOX TOOL, WILL BE VALUABLE FOR FUTURE INTERFACING WITH EFFORTS AT IUCN, BIEN (THE BOTANICAL INFORMATION AND ECOLOGY NETWORK), AND OTHER SIMILAR PROJECTS THAT USE SDM PREDICTIONS AS INPUTS.

LIKE JUPITER, BROWN DWARFS EXPERIENCE WEATHER PATTERNS, DETECTED AS PHOTOMETRIC OR TIME-RESOLVED SPECTROSCOPIC VARIABILITY DUE TO PHOTOSPHERIC INHOMOGENEITIES AND THEIR RAPID ROTATION. IN BROWN DWARFS COLDER THAN 1900K, VARIABILITY IS CAUSED BY HETEROGENEOUS CLOUD COVERAGE IN THEIR ATMOSPHERES. PATCHINESS IN CLOUDS AND VARYING OPACITIES ALLOW LIGHT FROM DEEPER LAYERS OF THE ATMOSPHERE TO REACH THE SURFACE OF THE PHOTOSPHERE. UNDERSTANDING VARIABILITY AND THE VERTICAL STRUCTURE OF BROWN DWARF ATMOSPHERES IS A CRUCIAL STEP TOWARDS DETAILED CHARACTERIZATION OF EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERES AND THEIR WEATHER SYSTEMS, AS YOUNG BROWN DWARFS OVERLAP IN TEMPERATURES AND SURFACE GRAVITIES WITH GIANT EXOPLANETS. IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS, JWST AND GROUND-BASED 30M TELESCOPES WILL ACHIEVE EXQUISITE DETAIL IN BROWN DWARF AND EXOPLANET OBSERVATIONS, POSSIBLY EVEN TO BEGIN THE SEARCH FOR BIOSIGNATURES IN EXOPLANET SPECTRA. THEREFORE, IT IS CRUCIAL AND TIMELY TO PURSUE DETAILED SPECTROSCOPIC STUDIES TO CHARACTERIZE LOW TEMPERATURE ATMOSPHERES. VARIABILITY SURVEYS UNTIL NOW HAVE BEEN UNINFORMED, AS THERE IS NO METHOD TO IDENTIFY VARIABLE BROWN DWARF CANDIDATES A PRIORI, AND BOTH LIGHT CURVES AND TIME-RESOLVED SPECTROSCOPY ARE RESOURCE-INTENSIVE OBSERVATIONAL TECHNIQUES. WE PROPOSE A TECHNIQUE TO IDENTIFY CANDIDATE VARIABLE BROWN DWARFS FROM A SINGLE, LOW-RESOLUTION, NEAR-INFRARED SPECTRUM TO INFORM THESE SEARCHES. THE SPECTRAL SIGNATURES RESULTING FROM INHOMOGENEOUS CLOUD COVERAGE AND LEADING TO PHOTOMETRIC VARIABILITY ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE FROM BLENDEDLIGHT SPECTRAL BINARIES. ESSENTIALLY, BOTH SPECTRA LOOK LIKE A BLEND OF TWO DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE ATMOSPHERES. SPECTRAL BINARIES ARE SYSTEMS OF ULTRACOOL DWARFS OF DIFFERENT SUBTYPES WHOSE PROXIMITY IN ANGULAR SPACE YIELDS A SINGLE, UNRESOLVED PECULIAR SPECTRUM. THE PATCHINESS IN CLOUD COVERAGE AND VARYING CLOUD OPACITIES, ALLOW THE OBSERVER TO PEER DEEPER INTO HOTTER LAYERS OF THE ATMOSPHERE, LEADING TO A SIMILAR BLENDED-LIGHT EFFECT ON THE SPECTRUM OF A SINGLE VARIABLE OBJECT. THE SPECTRAL BINARY TECHNIQUE IS ABLE TO IDENTIFY BLENDED ATMOSPHERES, WHETHER THEY ORIGINATE FROM TWO BINARY COMPONENTS OR TWO CLOUD DECKS IN A SINGLE OBJECT. THEREFORE, WE CAN OPTIMIZE THE TECHNIQUE TO IDENTIFY VARIABLE BROWN DWARFS ON THEIR OWN. WE PROPOSE A PILOT PROGRAM TO OPTIMIZE THE SPECTRAL BINARY TECHNIQUE TO IDENTIFY HIGH-PROBABILITY CANDIDATE, PHOTOMETRICALLY VARIABLE BROWN DWARFS WITH A SINGLE, LOW-RESOLUTION, NEAR-INFRARED SPECTRUM, FOLLOWING THESE STEPS: - GATHER ALL PUBLICLY AVAILABLE NEAR INFRARED SPECTRA OF ULTRACOOL DWARFS LATER THAN L3, INCLUDING YOUNG AND FIELD BROWN DWARFS - ANALYZE AND REFINE EXISTING SPECTRAL INDICES FOR REDUNDANCY WITH PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS - DESIGN NEW SPECTRAL INDICES FOR VARIABILITY BY IDENTIFYING THE STATIC SIGNATURES OF VARIABILITY AND/OR CLOUDS FROM SPECTRA OF KNOWN VARIABLE BROWN DWARFS - VALIDATE TECHNIQUE AND DELIVER NEW HIGH-PROBABILITY CANDIDATES FROM ARCHIVAL NEAR-INFRARED SPECTRA OF FIELD AND YOUNG L- AND T-TYPE BROWN DWARFS - FUTURE FOLLOW-UP AFTER THIS PILOT PROGRAM WILL INCLUDE ADAPTIVE OPTICS IMAGING TO CONFIRM BINARY SYSTEMS AND TESS LIGHT CURVES TO MEASURE VARIABILITY ON CANDIDATES, THUS ENABLING FUTURE EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERE STUDIES. THIS PROPOSAL ALIGNS WITH TWO OF NASA''S STRATEGIC GOALS, BOTH PHYSICS OF THE COSMOS AND EXOPLANET EXPLORATION. AS AN IMMEDIATE GOAL, THE DESIGN OF THE TECHNIQUE WILL PROVIDE CANDIDATES FOR VARIABILITY SEARCHES, PERMITTING A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF ULTRACOOL ATMOSPHERES. WE WILL STUDY VARIABILITY SIGNATURES IN PARALLEL BETWEEN YOUNG AND FIELD BROWN DWARFS TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF SURFACE GRAVITY IN SHAPING THE VERTICAL STRUCTURE OF ULTRACOOL ATMOSPHERES.

THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AN OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, CALLED OPENSPACE, FOR VISUALIZING NASA ASTROPHYSICS, HELIOPHYSICS, PLANETARY SCIENCE, AND EARTH SCIENCE MISSION ENGINEERING ACTIVITIES AND SCIENCE RESULTS FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC, STUDENTS, TEACHERS, AND CITIZEN SCIENTISTS EVERYWHERE. THE  PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AND WIDELY DISSEMINATE OPENSPACE, CREATE INNOVATIVE AND NETWORKED PROGRAMS WITH ISI PARTNERS, PRODUCE EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES FOR MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS AND STUDENTS, AND ESTABLISH ROBUST PARTNERSHIPS WITH NASA SMD MISSIONS, ISIS, AND VISUALIZATION RESEARCH CENTERS.  THE PROJECT IS BASED ON THE SUCCESS OF PILOT EFFORTS TO VISUALIZE THE NEW HORIZONS MISSION AND HELIOPHYSICS AND SPACE WEATHER SIMULATION DATA GENERATED BY NASA GODDARDS COMMUNITY COORDINATED MODELING CENTER. IT BUILDS ON AMNHS EXPERTISE IN SCIENCE VISUALIZATION AND ITS RECORD OF SUCCESS IN PARTNERING WITH NASA TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE PROGRAMMING, EXHIBITIONS, AND SPACE SHOWS THAT ENGAGE, INSPIRE, AND EDUCATE STUDENTS, TEACHERS, AND LEARNERS OF ALL AGES.  DRAWING TOGETHER A HIGHLY QUALIFIED AND EXCEPTIONALLY TALENTED TEAM OF SCIENTISTS, EDUCATORS, SOFTWARE ENGINEERS, AND VISUALIZATION SPECIALISTS, THE PROJECTS AIM IS TO  BUILD A PIPELINE FOR TRANSMITTING VISUALIZED SCIENCE CONTENT FROM ACROSS NASA SMD DIVISIONS TO  ISIS, SECONDARY SCHOOL CLASSROOMS, AND THE PUBLIC.  TO DO SO, THE PROJECT PROPOSES THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES  DEVELOP OPENSPACE INTO A ROBUST AND FLEXIBLE INTERACTIVE VISUALIZATION SOFTWARE THAT SUPPORTS THE PRESENTATION OF DYNAMIC DATA SETS AND THAT IS EASILY UPDATED FOR THE PRESENTATION OF CURRENT SCIENCE.  FORM A NETWORK OF ISIS TO INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF OPENSPACE AND DEVELOP ASSOCIATED PROGRAMMING TO ENGAGE AND EDUCATE DIVERSE AUDIENCES.

STUDIES INCLUDE A COMBINATION OF ASTROPHYSICAL-COSMOCHEMICAL THEORY AND MODELING; TEXTURAL, PETROLOGICAL, AND CHEMICAL STUDIES OF METEORITES; AND LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS TO TEST CHEMICAL MODEL PREDICTIONS. PETROLOGICAL WORK WILL INCLUDE SURFACE CHEMICAL AND VOLUMETRIC 3-DIMENSIONAL CT MAPPING OF METEORITES TO ALLOW TESTS OF ASTROPHYSICAL THEORIES OF HOW CHONDRULES AND MATRIX ACCRETED INTO LARGER BODIES, AND HOW CHONDRULES MIGHT BE SIZE-SORTED. THE 3D CT WILL ALSO ALLOW DENSITY ESTIMATES OF CHONDRULE POPULATIONS. THIS IS COMPLEMENTED BY POSITION-SENSITIVE X-RAY DIFFRACTION FOR MODAL MINERAL ABUNDANCES(AT CUNY). WE WILL FOCUS ON SELECTED ORDINARY CHONDRITES (THE MOST ABUNDANT PRIMITIVE METEORITES) AND CR CHONDRITES, TO MEASURE THE ABUNDANCE AND SIZES OF THEIR MILLIMETER-SIZED CHONDRULES, AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF ELEMENTS AMONG CHONDRULES AND MATRIX. WE WILL ALSO APPLY THE SAME TOOLS TO THE VERY DIFFERENT CM CHONDRITES. THE 3D CT WILL INVOLVE STUDENT INVESTIGATORS AT FORDHAM. THIS WORK WILL INCREASE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF ASTEROID PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND CLARIFY HOW WE COULD USE CHONDRITIC BODIES AS IN SITU RESOURCES FOR SPACE EXPLORATION.

WE WILL MEASURE THESE DISTRIBUTIONS AMONG CHONDRITE COMPONENTS. WE WILL USE THOSE RESULTS TO INTERPRET THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF TRACE ELEMENTS AMONG COMPONENTS IN A RANGE OF CHONDRITE TYPES, TO TEST ASTROPHYSICALCOSMOCHEMICAL HYPOTHESES FOR THE ORIGINS OF COMPONENTS AND THEIR ACCRETION.

OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE EXTREMELY DETAILED 3D INFORMATION ON GRAIN LOCATIONS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS GOAL. A FURTHER GOAL IS TO DEVELOP OUR ABILITY TO MODEL THE PHYSICS OF HYPERVELOCITY IMPACTS INTO AEROGEL SO THAT THE ORIGINAL PROPERTIES MASS, POROSITY OF IMPACTING COMETARY PARTICLES MIGHT BE INFERRED. WE HAVE OBTAINED THE HYDRODYNAMIC CODES CTH AND ISALE, AND WE WILL WORK WITH COLLABORATOR GROUP TO DEVELOP AN EQUATION OF STATE FOR SILICA AEROGEL.

KEPLER HAS REVEALED FREQUENT SUPERFLARES ON SOLAR-TYPE STARS, PROVIDING A MECHANISM BY WHICH HOST STARS MAY HAVE PROFOUND EFFECTS ON THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL EVOLUTION OF EXOPLANETARY ATMOSPHERES. WHAT EFFECT DO EXTREME ENERGY FLUXES FROM ERUPTIVE EVENTS DURING EARLY STELLAR EVOLUTION TOGETHER WITH UV LIGHT HAVE ON PREBIOTIC CHEMISTRY, IN PARTICULAR ON THE PRODUCTION OF SMALL MOLECULE PRECURSORS CURRENTLY THOUGHT NECESSARY FOR NUCLEOSIDE SYNTHESIS, AND BY CONSEQUENCE THE ORIGIN OF LIFE ON PRIMITIVE PLANETS? THIS MAY BE IMPORTANT IN TERRESTRIAL PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES, WHERE SPECIES SUCH AS MOLECULAR NITROGEN AND CARBON DIOXIDE WOULD REQUIRE HIGH ENERGY IRRADIATION IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE RECOMBINED INTO REACTIVE SPECIES SUCH AS HCN AND NOX, THE FORMER OF WHICH IS CONSIDERED CRUCIAL FOR NUCLEOSIDE FORMATION   AN OUTSTANDING CHALLENGE IN THE FIELD. OUR PROPOSAL AIMS TO ADDRESS THESE MAJOR QUESTIONS BY PERFORMING COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF IONIZING RADIATION INITIATED BY ENERGETIC ERUPTIVE EVENTS INCLUDING SUPERFLARES FROM YOUNG STARS AND ASSOCIATED PARTICLE EVENTS ON THE PREBIOTIC CHEMISTRY OF THE EARLY EARTH AND ITS TWINS. FIRST, WE WILL CALIBRATE ATMOSPHERIC PHOTO-COLISSIONAL CHEMICAL MODELS USING EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION OF GAS AND AQUEOUS PHASE CHEMISTRY. SECOND, WE WILL CHARACTERIZE THE PROCESSES OF NITROGEN FIXATION AND THE CHAIN OF REACTIONS PRODUCING NOX, N2O, HCN AND OTHER N-CONTAINING SPECIES IN A GAS- AND LATER LIQUID-PHASE THAT MAY EVENTUALLY FORM ORGANIC MOLECULES OF VARYING DEGREES OF COMPLEXITY ESPECIALLY THOSE RELEVANT IN THE PREBIOTIC SYNTHESIS OF NUCLEOSIDES, NOTABLY RNA. METHODOLOGY. WE WILL EMPLOY OUR 1D PHOTO-COLLISIONAL ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY MODEL TO COMPUTE THE CHEMICAL FORMATION RATES OF COMPLEX ORGANIC MOLECULES INCLUDING O- AND N-CONTAINING HYDROCARBONS IN THE GAS PHASE. THESE SIMULATIONS WILL ALLOW TO US INVESTIGATE THE VIABLE PHOTOCHEMICAL MECHANISMS FOR NITROGEN AND OXYGEN FIXATION INTO COMPLEX ORGANIC MOLECULES IN THE ATMOSPHERES OF EARLY EARTH AND MARS. THESE SIMULATIONS WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN EXPERIMENTS THAT EXPLORE THE STEADY-STATE GAS COMPOSITION OF N2/CO2/H2O GAS MIXTURES, ALONE AND IN COMBINATION WITH MINOR AMOUNTS OF CO OR CH4, EXPOSED TO A VARIETY OF ENERGY SOURCES INCLUDING PARTICLES, ELECTRIC DISCHARGES AND UV LIGHT, AS WELL AS THE NATURE OF THE WATER SOLUBLE SPECIES WHEN GENERATED IN THE PRESENCE OF AN AQUEOUS PHASE HELD AT VARIOUS PH VALUES THAT SIMULATE PRIMITIVE PLANETARY STANDING WATER BODIES. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES WILL BE CONDUCTED BY FLOWING 0.1 TO 1 ATM TOTAL PRESSURE GAS MIXTURES CONTAINING VARIOUS PARTIAL PRESSURES OF CO2 AND N2 TOGETHER WITH ADMIXTURES OF LESSER AMOUNTS OF H2O, CO, H2 OR CH4. THESE WILL BE IRRADIATED BY A PROTON GUN, UV LAMP AND ELECTRIC DISCHARGE. STEADY-STATE GAS COMPOSTIONS WILL BE MEASURED DOWNSTREAM FROM THE REACTION CHAMBER USING A RESIDUAL GAS ANALYZER. SOLUBLE SPECIES WILL BE MEASURED USING ION CHROMATOGRAPHY, DIRECT INFUSION TIME-OF-FLIGHT MASS SPECTROMETRY, SPECTROSCOPICALLY USING NMR, AND CHEMICALLY WITH VARIOUS ASSAYS.

THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CONDITIONS SETTING STAGE FOR THE ORIGIN OF LIFE ON EARTH, THE RESOLUTION OF THE FYS ON THE EARLY EARTH/MARS AND HABITABILITY CONDITIONS ON TERRESTRIAL PLANETS AROUND YOUNG STARS. AS A SOURCE OF PREBIOTIC NITROGEN THIS WORK IS RELEVANT TO THE RESEARCH AREA OF  PREBIOTIC EVOLUTION . ABIOTIC NITROGEN FIXATION IS ONE OF THE  PLANETARY AND MOLECULAR PROCESSES THAT SET THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CONDITIONS WITHIN WHICH LIVING SYSTEMS MAY HAVE ARISEN  BY HELPING TO UNDERSTAND HOW PLANETARY NITROGEN BECAME AVAILABLE FOR USE IN THE ORIGIN AND EARLY EVOLUTION OF LIFE.

THE EARTH FORMED IN A WATER-POOR REGION OF THE PROTOPLANETARY DISK, AND EVEN TODAY THE BULK EARTH IS COSMICALLY DRY (POOR IN HYDROGEN, RELATIVE TO THE PROTOPLANETARY DISK). AT SOME 60 MA AFTER EARTH-ACCRETION, THE MOON-FORMING IMPACT PROBABLY REMOVED ANY WATER THAT MAY HAVE OUTGASSED AFTER CORE FORMATION, LEAVING THE HADEAN EARTH WATER-POOR AT ITS SURFACE. YET, EARLY ZIRCONS ARGUE THAT OCEANS EXISTED BY 250 MA AFTER FORMATION. SO, WAS WATER DELIVERED BY IMPACT DURING THE INTERVENING MILLENNIA, WHILE THE DECLINING HEAVY BOMBARDMENT WAS IN FULL SWING? WHAT ROLE DID PRIMITIVE BODIES PLAY IN DELIVERING WATER AND PRE-BIOTIC ORGANICS TO THE YOUNG EARTH? TOGETHER, THE INTERCOMPARISON OF COMETS (AND THEIR DYNAMICAL FAMILIES) WILL ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND WILL ALSO CLARIFY KEY QUESTIONS OF COMETARY ORIGINS. THE GODDARD COMET TEAM PIONEERED THE DIRECT STUDY OF PRIMARY VOLATILES IN COMETS AT INFRARED WAVELENGTHS, ESTABLISHING THE THEORETICAL BASIS FOR THIS APPROACH (MUMMA NASA CP-2223 1982, WEAVER AND MUMMA APJ 1984) AND DEMONSTRATING ITS FIRST SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION BY DETECTING H20 IN COMET IP/HALLEY IN 1985 (MUMMA ET AL. SCIENCE 1986). SINCE THEN, THE EVER-EXPANDING AND -EVOLVING GODDARD TEAM HAS PUBLISHED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED REFEREED PAPERS BASED ON AIRBORNE AND GROUND-BASED ASTRONOMICAL SPECTROSCOPY OF COMETS, EXTENDING THE APPROACH TO MANY MOLECULAR SPECIES INCLUDING ISOTOPOLOGUES. SINCE ITS INCEPTION, THIS IR APPROACH HAS BECOME A STANDARD FOR REMOTE SENSING OF PRIMARY VOLATILES IN COMETS, AND MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT GROUPS WORLDWIDE NOW APPLY IT. AUGMENTED BY RADIO INVESTIGATIONS, THE COMBINED APPROACHES NOW ADDRESS UP TO SEVERAL DOZEN MOLECULAR SPECIES IN A GIVEN COMET, PERMITTING ATTEMPTS TO DEFINE A TAXONOMY FOR COMETS BASED ON THEIR VOLATILE COMPOSITION, USING THE SO-QUANTIFIED ABUNDANCES OF PRIMARY COMA VOLATILES THAT WERE STORED INITIALLY IN THE ICY NUCLEUS. TODAY, THIS RESEARCH IS ACHIEVED THROUGH THE CURRENT GENERATION OF NEAR-INFRARED (A.#tilde# 1-5  M) LONG-SLIT ECHELLE GRATING SPECTROMETERS THAT INCORPORATE LARGE-FORMAT 2-D DETECTOR ARRAYS (2KX2K) WITH SUB-ARC-SECOND PIXEL SIZES. THEY COMBINE HIGH ANGULAR RESOLUTION (TYPICALLY :S 1 ARC-SECOND) WITH THE HIGH SPECTRAL RESOLVING POWER (A./8A. 2: 2.5X104 AND HIGHER) REQUIRED FOR ISOLATION OF INDIVIDUAL COMETARY EMISSION LINES. IN PARALLEL WITH THEIR FIRST-LINE USE OF DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED INSTRUMENTS, THE TEAM ALSO ACHIEVED MAJOR ADVANCES IN THEORY AND DATA PROCESSING. THESE WERE ENABLED BY THE ADVENT OF COMPREHENSIVE SPECTROSCOPIC DATABASES CONTAINING BILLIONS OF LINES, ROBUST RADIATIVE TRANSFER MODELS, AND UNPRECEDENTED COMPUTATIONAL POWER. THEY TRANSFORMED THE WAY WE INVESTIGATE COMETARY ATMOSPHERES. THE GOAL IS TO EXTRACT THE MAXIMUM SCIENCE FROM DATA RETURNED BY THESE INSTRUMENTS. THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY PROPOSES TO CONDUCT COOPERATIVE RESEARCH WITH THE GODDARD CENTER FOR ASTROBIOLOGY, USING A COMBINATION OF RESEARCHERS AND STAFF (TASK 3) AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF EXPERTISE, FROM UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS (TASK 2) TO PH.D. SCIENTISTS (TASK 1). AMERICAN UNIVERSITY P. I. DR. ULYSSES SOFIA WILL OVERSEE ASPECTS OF AU ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT FOR THIS ACTIVITY. TASK 1: WORKING WITH THE GODDARD TEAM, DR. MANUELA LIPPI WILL RE-ANALYZE THE COMET DATABASE IN A CONSISTENT FASHION USING THE NEWEST METHODOLOGY, AND SO PROVIDE THE MOST ACCURATE DATABASE OF MOLECULAR ABUNDANCES AND RELATED PARAMETERS.

A HIGH-PERFORMANCE SOLID-STATE CRYOCOOLER BASED ON THERMOMAGNETIC COOLING VIA THE ETTINGSHAUSEN EFFECT CAN BE LIGHTER, SMALLER, VIBRATION FREE, AND USE LESS POWER THAN THE ALTERNATIVES. HISTORICALLY, THE PRACTICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE ETTINGSHAUSEN COOLERS WAS DISCOURAGED AS THEY REQUIRED A MAGNETIC FIELD DIFFICULT TO REACH BY TRADITIONAL FERRITE MAGNETS. HOWEVER, RECENT RARE-EARTH PERMANENT MAGNETS CAN PRODUCE THE REQUIRED FIELD RELIABLY. WE PROPOSE AN ETTINGSHAUSEN COOLER CONSISTING OF ADVANCED PERMANENT MAGNETS COMBINED WITH A NOVEL SEMICONDUCTOR HETEROSTRUCTURE PREDICTED TO SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SOLID-STATE CRYOGENIC COOLING IN A COMPACT SIZE.

STELLAR ROTATION COUPLED WITH CONVECTIVE MOTIONS GIVE RISE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS. HIGH PRECISION SPECTROSCOPY AND PHOTOMETRY MEASUREMENTS HAVE DETECTED CYCLES IN THE MAGNETIC ACTIVITY OF STARS SIMILAR TO THE 11 YEAR SOLAR CYCLE. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DISCOVER CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT GOVERN STELLAR CYCLE DYNAMICS UTILIZING SPECTROSCOPY AND PHOTOMETRY MEASUREMENTS FROM SUN-LIKE STARS. IN PARTICULAR, OUR INVESTIGATION WILL RELATE BASIC OBSERVABLES, SUCH AS MASS, METALLICITY, RADIUS, ROTATION RATE, DEPTH OF CONVECTION ZONE, AND DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION RATES WITH TOTAL SOLAR IRRADIANCE AND STARSPOT PROPERTIES INCLUDING: TOTAL SPOTTEDNESS AND SWITCHING OF DOMINANT ACTIVITY BETWEEN LONGITUDES (FLIP-FLOP CYCLES). WE WILL FOCUS ON DETERMINING WHICH FACTORS CONTROL THE PERIODICITY OF STARSPOTS, HOW STELLAR CYCLES EVOLVE WITH THE AGE OF STARS, AND WHICH FACTORS DETERMINE DEEP GLOBAL MINIMA IN STELLAR CYCLE DYNAMICS. METHODOLOGY: WE WILL UTILIZE A SET OF INFORMATION-THEORETICAL TOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN RECENTLY DEVELOPED TO EXAMINE CAUSE AND EFFECT RELATIONSHIPS IN OBSERVATIONAL DATASETS. TRANSFER ENTROPY AND MUTUAL REDUNDANCY ARE ENTROPY-BASED MEASURES OF DEPENDENCY (E.G. MUTUAL INFORMATION) THAT ARE BASED ON CONDITIONAL PROBABILITIES AND CAN BE USED TO MEASURE THE DIRECTED INFORMATION TRANSFER BETWEEN TWO VARIABLES. THE CONDITIONAL REDUNDANCY WILL BE USED TO SYSTEMATICALLY ISOLATE CONTROLLING VARIABLES FROM A SET OF INPUT MEASUREMENTS. ONCE CAUSAL VARIABLES ARE IDENTIFIED, WE WILL CONSTRUCT COUPLING FUNCTIONS TO DESCRIBE THE DEPENDENCE OF STELLAR CYCLE DYNAMICS ON THE CAUSAL VARIABLES USING THE PRINCIPLE OF MAXIMIZATION OF INFORMATION. PROPOSED CONTRIBUTION TO THE FOCUS TEAM EFFORT AND RELEVANCE TO NASA: THIS INVESTIGATION WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE FOCUS TEAM EFFORT 3.1.2 \THE SOLAR-STELLAR CONNECTION.\"" THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUES WILL BE USED TO IDENTIFY PROCESSES (VARIABLES) THAT CONTROL TOTAL SOLAR IRRADIANCE AND STARSPOT CYCLES, INCLUDING PERIODICITY AND DEEP GLOBAL MINIMA, AND TO CONSTRUCT NONLINEAR MAPS THAT CAPTURE THE ACTIVITY CYCLE DYNAMICS AND HAVE PREDICTIVE VALUE. THE PROPOSED PROJECT RELIES HEAVILY ON COLLABORATIONS WITH OBSERVERS AND MODELERS ON THE LWS TEAM. OUR PLAN IS TO WORK WITH OBSERVERS ON THE TEAM TO COMPILE A DATABASE OF VARIABLES THAT CHARACTERIZE THE MAGNETIC ACTIVITY CYCLE DYNAMICS AND TO IDENTIFY CAUSAL VARIABLES THAT CONTROL THE DYNAMICS. WE WILL WORK WITH TEAM MODELERS TO EVALUATE THE OUTPUT FROM PREDICTIVE MODELS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ADEQUATELY CAPTURE THE SYSTEM DYNAMICS, AND WE WILL USE THE PRINCIPLE OF MAXIMIZATION OF INFORMATION TO CONSTRUCT PREDICTIVE MODELS FOR STARSPOT DYNAMICS. IDENTIFICATION OF OBSERVABLES AND MODEL PARAMETERS THAT CONTROL SOLAR CYCLE DYNAMICS WILL ALSO ADVANCE GOAL 1 FROM THE HELIOPHYSICS DECADAL SURVEY \""DETERMINE THE ORIGINS OF THE SUN''S ACTIVITY AND PREDICT THE VARIATIONS IN THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT.\"""""

ATOM-INTERFEROMETRIC INERTIAL SENSORS HAVE DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE OVER CONVENTIONAL INERTIAL DEVICES OWING TO THE INTRINSIC STABILITY OF ATOMIC SYSTEMS. CENTRAL TO MAKING COLD ATOM SENSORS PRACTICAL IS THEIR ABILITY TO RELIABLY OPERATE FOR EXTENDED PERIODS WITHOUT USER INTERVENTION. CURRENT LASER DIODES, WHICH ARE AT THE HEART OF ATOMIC SENSORS, SUFFER FROM POWER DEGRADATION AND MODE HOPS ON TIMESCALES INCOMPATIBLE WITH LONG TERM DEPLOYMENT. BECAUSE THESE PROPERTIES ARE INHERENT TO THE DIODES, IT IS PRUDENT TO CIRCUMVENT THESE PROBLEMS WITH DIAGNOSTIC PROTOCOLS AIMED AT EARLY DETECTION AND ACTION. DIODES CLOSE TO MODE HOPPING CAN BE TEMPORARILY TAKEN OFFLINE TO TUNE AWAY THE MODE HOP VIA CURRENT AND TEMPERATURE. DIODES WITH DEGRADED POWER CAN BE TAKEN OFFLINE ENTIRELY IN FAVOR OF A HEALTHY DIODE.

CARBON IS A KEY PREBIOTIC ELEMENT AND A MAJOR COMPONENT IN PROTOPLANETARY MATERIALS. THUS, UNDERSTANDING THE EVOLUTION OF CARBON WILL HELP CONSTRAIN THE ASTROCHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT OF TERRESTRIAL PLANET FORMATION AND THE PRODUCTION OF PREBIOTIC COMPOUNDS IN THE EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM. THE SOLAR SYSTEM 12C/13C RATIO IS #tilde# 87, WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE 12C/13C OF THE SURROUNDING INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM (#tilde# 69). FURTHER, HIGH-RESOLUTION ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS TOWARD LOW-MASS YOUNG STELLAR OBJECTS (YSOS) HAVE REVEALED UNEXPECTED HETEROGENEITY IN GAS-PHASE [12C16O[/[13C16O] (HERETOFORE, 12CO/13CO), SUGGESTING THAT COMPLEX CHEMISTRY MAY BE AFFECTING PROTOPLANETARY CARBON RATHER THAN SUGGESTED DIRECT INHERITANCE FROM THE PARENT CLOUD. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO EXPLAIN ISOTOPIC OBSERVATIONS TOWARD YSOS, AND ACHIEVE A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERLYING CHEMISTRY AFFECTING EARLY CARBON RESERVOIRS IN THE SOLAR NEBULA THROUGH THE FOLLOWING: (1) OBSERVATIONS -WE WILL ANALYZE HIGH-RESOLUTION CO DATA OF BRIGHT YSOS ALONG A GALACTIC GRADIENT, OBSERVED WITH THE KECK TELESCOPE, AND INFORMED BY ARCHIVED KECK AND CRIRES DATA. RATIOS OF [12CO]/[13CO] DERIVED FROM THE DATA WILL BE INTERPRETED IN THE CONTEXT OF 12C/13C FROM OTHER CARBON-BASED RESERVOIRS (I.E., CO AND CO2 ICE) THAT ARE ALONG THE SAME LINE-OF-SIGHT, THEREBY ENABLING A DIRECT INVESTIGATION OF CARBON INHERITANCE IN EACH PROTOPLANETARY SYSTEM; (2) EXPERIMENTS - WE WILL PERFORM INTERSTELLAR ICE EXPERIMENTS TO EXPLORE CARBON FRACTIONATION PATHWAYS BETWEEN CO AND CO2 MOLECULAR RESERVOIRS, FURTHER AIDING IN THE INTERPRETATION OF ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS; AND (3) MODELS - WE WILL CREATE THEORETICAL MODELS TO HELP PARAMETERIZE OBSERVED ISOTOPE RATIOS AND FURTHER DEFINE THE CHEMICAL PATHWAYS ALONG EACH LINE-OF-SIGHT, TRACKING CHANGES IN THE CARBON-CONTAINING GAS AND ICE. OUR GOAL IS TO ADD SIGNIFICANTLY TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF CARBON EVOLUTION IN THE EARLY SOLAR NEBULA, AND HELP PUT THE SOLAR SYSTEM INTO A MEANINGFUL CONTEXT WITH RESPECT TO OTHER PROTOPLANETARY SYSTEMS. METHODOLOGY: HIGH-RESOLUTION ROVIBRATIONAL SPECTRA FROM NIRSPEC ON THE KECK TELESCOPE WILL BE USED TO DERIVE PRECISE ABUNDANCES FOR CO ISOTOPOLOGUES, INCLUDING 12C18O AND 12C17O, WHICH HELP CONSTRAIN THE ANALYSIS. OBSERVATIONS OF MASSIVE YSOS WILL BE LED BY THE PI AND COLLABORATOR BLAKE, AND OUR CUSTOMIZED CODES WILL BE USED FOR DATA REDUCTION AND ANALYSIS OF NEW AND ARCHIVAL DATA. A SET OF NEW DATA WILL BE OBTAINED TO FILL IN MISSING REGIONS OF THE GALACTIC GRADIENT. ARCHIVAL DATA FROM THE CRIRES AND KECK ARCHIVES WILL BE USED TO HELP CONSTRAIN 13CO ABUNDANCES, WHICH ARE USEFUL FOR INPUT INTO THE MODELS. CO-I GUDIPATI WILL LEAD THE EXPERIMENTS AT HIS JPL LAB, WHICH IS EQUIPPED TO EXPLORE MOLECULAR RESERVOIRS AND POTENTIAL FRACTIONATION MECHANISMS BETWEEN ISOTOPOLOGUES OF CO AND CO2 IN ICE AND GAS PHASES UNDER RELEVANT INTERSTELLAR CONDITIONS. THE CO MODELS LED BY CO-I WILLACY WILL TRACK GAS AND ICE ISOTOPE CHEMISTRY IN A RANGE OF SYSTEMS AIMED AT EXPLORING CO ICE- AND GAS-RESERVOIRS, USING APPROPRIATE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS. THE MODELS WILL DERIVE MOLECULAR ISOTOPE RATIOS ACROSS TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS IDENTIFIED FROM THE SPECTRAL ANALYSES. THE ENTIRE PROPOSAL TEAM WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE SCIENCE, AND THE PI WILL RECRUIT 3 STUDENTS/YEAR TO PARTICIPATE IN DEFINED ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT. RELEVANCE: THIS PROJECT IS RELEVANT TO MANY ASPECTS OF THE EMERGING WORLDS (EW) SCOPE, INCLUDING INVESTIGATIONS OF  PROCESSES THAT RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO THE CHEMICAL NATURE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM,   AND ADDRESSES THE RELEVANT TOPICS OF PROTOPLANETARY DISK FORMATION AND EVOLUTION (VIA UNDERSTANDING THEIR PRIMORDIAL CORE PHASES), LARGE-SCALE ISOTOPIC FRACTIONATION PROCESSES, AND CHEMICAL PROCESSING OF GAS AND ICE. FURTHER, OUR STUDY IS RELEVANT TO THE EW ENCOURAGEMENT OF INTERDISCIPLINARY WORK."

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF RECENT MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION AND GEODETIC ACCURACY OF LUNAR TOPOGRAPHIC DATA AS A BASIS FOR CALCULATIONS TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE SELENOLOCATION OF THE M3 DATA. ROOT-MEAN-SQUARED (RMS) POSITIONAL ERRORS WILL BE REDUCED FROM #tilde#200 M RELATIVE AND 450 M ABSOLUTE TO ON THE ORDER OF A PIXEL (140 M) OR BETTER, AND THE NUMEROUS IMAGES WITH GROSS POSITIONAL ERRORS OF KILOMETERS WILL BE CORRECTED. SECONDARILY, SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC ACCURACY WILL BE IMPROVED THROUGH THE USE OF A MUCH MORE DETAILED TOPOGRAPHIC MODEL IN PHOTOMETRIC CORRECTIONS AND MORE ACCURATE REGISTRATION TO THIS MODEL. TWO DATASETS WILL BE USED: (1) DIGITAL DATA FROM THE M3 PDS ARCHIVE, INCLUDING HYPERSPECTRAL DATA FROM TWO MAJOR OPTICAL IMAGING PERIODS, ANCILLARY DATA INCLUDING SPICE KERNELS, SELENOLOCATION FILES, AND ENGINEERING DATA SUFFICIENT TO REPRODUCE AND IMPROVE UPON EARLIER RAY-TRACING RESULTS (BOARDMAN ET AL., 2011; GREEN ET AL., 2011); AND (2) THE FULL-RESOLUTION (#tilde#100 M/PIXEL) DIGITAL TERRAIN MODEL (DTM) DERIVED FROM STEREO IMAGING OF THE WIDE ANGLE CAMERA (WAC) INSTRUMENT ON THE LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (E.G., SCHOLTEN ET AL., 2011). THE WORK CONSISTS OF FIVE MAJOR TASKS: (1) SYSTEMATIC REPROCESSING OF THE FULL DATASET THROUGH THE MISSION-DEVELOPED LEVEL 1B PROCESSING PIPELINE USING THE WAC DTM TO GREATLY IMPROVE SELENOLOCATION ACCURACY; (2) DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE TOOLS FOR PROCESSING M3 DATA MOST IMPORTANTLY, A PHYSICALLY RIGOROUS CAMERA MODEL IN THE USGS ISIS3; (3) USE OF THE ADVANCED CAPABILITIES OF ISIS TO CONTROL THE GLOBAL M3 DATASET WITH IMPROVED ACCURACY AND GENERATE FURTHER IMPROVED LEVEL 1B PRODUCTS; (4) SYSTEMATIC REPROCESSING OF BEST VERSION OF LEVEL 1B DATA THROUGH THE MISSION DEVELOPED LEVEL 2 PROCESSING PIPELINE USING THE WAC DTM TO GREATLY IMPROVE PHOTOMETRIC ACCURACY; (5) GENERATION OF A COMPLETE SET OF ORTHORECTIFIED AND MOSAICKED (LEVEL 3) DATA PRODUCTS INCLUDING PHOTOMETRICALLY NORMALIZED SPECTRA AND SPECTRAL PARAMETER MAPS; AND (6) DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS, WITH INTERIM RESULTS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE ONLINE AND FINAL SPICE KERNELS, LEVEL 1B AND LEVEL 3 PRODUCTS FORMALLY ARCHIVED TO THE IMAGING NODE OF THE PLANETARY DATA SYSTEM (PDS). THE MULTIPLE PRODUCTS GENERATED BY THIS EFFORT WILL SERVE THE BROADEST POSSIBLE SET OF SCIENTIFIC APPLICATIONS OF THE M3 DATASET. LEVEL 1B PRODUCTS, WHICH ARE NOT SPATIALLY RESAMPLED, ARE ESSENTIAL FOR STUDIES REQUIRING THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE SPECTRAL FIDELITY, AND THE IMPROVED SELENOLOCATION ACCURACY OF OUR RESULTS WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PHOTOMETRIC NORMALIZATION OF THESE DATA AND FACILITATE COMPARISON WITH OTHER DATASETS. THE RESAMPLED LEVEL 3 PRODUCTS WILL GREATLY SIMPLIFY THE USE OF M3 FOR REGIONAL STUDIES IN WHICH SUMMARY SPECTRAL CHARACTERISTICS SUFFICE. FINALLY, THE COMBINATION OF A FULL SET OF ISIS TOOLS PLUS IMPROVED SPICE DATA WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR USERS WHOSE SPECIAL NEEDS ARE NOT MET BY EITHER OF THESE PRODUCT SETS TO DO THEIR OWN M3 PROCESSING."

GIANT IMPACTS GENERATE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF BOUND AND ESCAPING DEBRIS; HOWEVER, CURRENT PARAMETERIZED HYDRODYNAMIC STUDIES ONLY DESCRIBE THE LARGEST ONE OR TWO REMNANTS IN MINIMAL DETAIL. THESE STUDIES ALSO LACK KEY ANGLE, SIZE-SCALE, AND COMPOSITION DEPENDENCE OF GIANT IMPACT OUTCOMES NECESSARY FOR INFORMING CUTTING-EDGE N-BODY PLANETARY EVOLUTION MODELS. DUE TO THESE DEFICIENCIES, CURRENT N-BODY CODES LACK THE ABILITY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ORBITAL DAMPING OF TERRESTRIAL PLANETS AND THE MIXING OF MATERIAL BETWEEN PLANETARY BODIES. THE NATURE OF GIANT IMPACT DEBRIS IS PARAMOUNT IN UNDERSTANDING THE GENESIS OF SMALL BODY POPULATIONS, SATELLITE SYSTEMS, AND RE-IMPACTING BOLIDES. FOR EXAMPLE, EVIDENCE OF DEBRIS FROM THE MOON-FORMING GIANT IMPACT WAS FOUND IN THE MAIN-BELT ASTEROID POPULATION. COLLISIONS WILL NOT ONLY PREFERENTIALLY EXCAVATE ICY OR ROCKY MANTLE MATERIAL, BUT ESCAPING DEBRIS ON HELIOCENTRIC ORBITS WILL SERVE AS A HEAT SOURCE IN THE FORM OF RE-IMPACTING BOLIDES FOR TENS, IF NOT, HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS.

SPECIFICALLY, THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION FOCUSES ON TWO NEW ANGRITES AND TWO RECENTLY RECOVERED UNGROUPED ACHONDRITES. THE TWO ANGRITES PROPOSED TO BE STUDIED HERE REPRESENT NEW AND UNIQUE MEMBERS OF THIS SMALL BUT IMPORTANT GROUP OF ACHONDRITES, SOME OF WHICH HAVE PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS KEY AGE ANCHORS FOR THE APPLICATION OF SEVERAL HIGH RESOLUTION CHRONOMETERS TO PROCESSES OCCURRING IN THE EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM. THE TWO UNGROUPED ACHONDRITES THAT WILL BE STUDIED ARE ADDITIONALLY IMPORTANT SINCE THEY REPRESENT PREVIOUSLY UNSAMPLED PARENT BODIES, AND THUS PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BROADEN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF PLANETESIMAL DIFFERENTIATION PROCESSES AND TIMESCALES IN THE EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM. FOR THE INVESTIGATIONS PROPOSED HERE, WE WILL OBTAIN HIGH PRECISION INTERNAL 26AL-26MG AND 53MN-53CR ISOCHRONS FOR THESE SELECTED ACHONDRITES. TO ACHIEVE THIS, WE HAVE RECENTLY DEVELOPED THE ANALYTICAL PROTOCOLS AND TECHNIQUES FOR HIGH PRECISION ISOTOPIC ANALYSES OF MG AND CR USING MULTICOLLECTOR INDUCTIVELY COUPLED PLASMA MASS SPECTROMETRY.

THIS  GREAT OXIDATION EVENT  (GOE), WHICH WAS WELL UNDERWAY BY ABOUT 2.3 BILLION YEARS AGO, MADE LIFE LIKE US - AEROBIC LIFE - POSSIBLE. TO ELUCIDATE THE TIMING AND MECHANISM OF THIS CHANGE, WE NEED TO QUANTIFY SOURCES AND SINKS OF O2 (HOLLAND 2002; KASTING 2013; CATLING 2013). THE IMPORTANCE OF OXIDATIVE WEATHERING AS AN O2 SINK HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT TO CONSTRAIN. RECENT MODELS OF THE GOE INVOKE CHANGES IN CONTINENTAL CRUST COMPOSITION, AND THUS CHANGES IN THE CAPACITY OF OXIDATIVE WEATHERING TO CONSUME O2, TO EXPLAIN THE TIMING OF ATMOSPHERE OXYGENATION (E.G., LEE ET AL. 2016). HOWEVER, THESE MODELS ARE CONTENTIOUS AND POORLY CONSTRAINED BECAUSE THE RATES OF OXIDATIVE WEATHERING AT PRE-GOE LEVELS OF O2 ARE EXTRAPOLATED FROM EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED AT MUCH HIGHER PO2 (REINHARD ET AL. 2009; REINHARD ET AL. 2013). IMPROVING THESE MODELS REQUIRES HIGH-QUALITY EMPIRICAL DATA CONSTRAINING THE OXIDATION KINETICS OF CRUSTAL MATERIALS (ROCKS, SEDIMENTS, SOILS) CONDUCTED IN THE PO2 RANGE RELEVANT FOR ARCHEAN WEATHERING. HERE, I PROPOSE TO CONDUCT ULTRA-LOW PO2 EXPERIMENTS TO STUDY THE OXIDATION KINETICS OF MAJOR REDUCED SINKS SUCH AS BASALTS, KOMATIITES, AND ORGANIC-RICH BLACK SHALES AT PRE-GOE PO2. THIS WORK WILL BUILD ON EXPERIMENTS I HAVE ALREADY DONE WITH SULFIDES, AND WILL TELL US MORE ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE CONTINENTAL CRUST IN PROMPTING OR DELAYING THE GOE. TO DO THIS, I WILL USE RECENTLY DEVELOPED  LUMINESCENCE MEASURING OPTODE SENSOR  (LUMOS) TO MEASURE CONCENTRATIONS OF DISSOLVED OXYGEN DOWN TO SINGLE DIGIT NANOMOLAR CONCENTRATIONS (LEHNER ET AL. 2014). THESE LEVELS OF OXYGEN ARE UP TO THREE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE LOWER THAN THE LIMITS OF DETECTION ON PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED TECHNIQUES, AND BEGIN TO APPROACH THE LEVELS OF O2 CONSISTENT WITH AN ARCHEAN ATMOSPHERE (10-5 PRESENT ATMOSPHERIC LEVEL (PAL)   1 NM). USING A  CHEMOSTAT  DESIGN, I WILL CONDUCT OXIDATION EXPERIMENTS WITH LUMOS TO MEASURE KINETIC OXIDATION OF ARCHEAN SHALES, KOMATIITES, AND GRANITOIDS, AS WELL AS BASALTS OF VARIOUS COMPOSITIONS TO BEST APPROXIMATE THE ARCHEAN CONTINENTAL CRUST. THESE OXIDATION RATES WILL TELL US HOW EFFICIENTLY THE ARCHEAN CRUST MAY HAVE CONSUMED O2 PRIOR TO THE GOE, AND THUS PROVIDE CONSTRAINTS ON THE ROLE OF OXIDATIVE WEATHERING DURING THE OXYGENATION OF EARTH S ATMOSPHERE. GIVEN NASA S PLANETARY SCIENCE GOALS, THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS WELL-SUITED TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF LIFE ON EARTH TO GUIDE OUR SEARCH FOR LIFE ELSEWHERE. IN PARTICULAR, IT ADDRESSES THE FOLLOWING PLANETARY RESEARCH PROGRAM INVESTIGATION TOPICS: INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE ORIGINS, EVOLUTION, AND PROPERTIES OF THE ATMOSPHERES OF PLANETARY BODIES (INCLUDING SATELLITES, SMALL BODIES, AND EXOPLANETS), AND INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE ORIGIN AND EARLY EVOLUTION OF LIFE, THE POTENTIAL OF LIFE TO ADAPT TO DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS, AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR LIFE ELSEWHERE. THE WORK ADDRESSES THESE TOPICS BY TELLING US FOUR NEW THINGS: 1) IT WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND THE ROLES OF TECTONICS AND CRUSTAL COMPOSITION IN THE OXYGENATION OF PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES, 2) IT WILL INFORM OUR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT HOW COMMON O2 ATMOSPHERES MIGHT BE ON EARTH-LIKE EXOPLANETS, 3) IT WILL TEACH US ABOUT THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN BIOLOGICAL AND PLANETARY EVOLUTION IN SHAPING THE COMPOSITION OF PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES, AND 4) IT WILL GIVE US CONSTRAINTS ON THE AMBIENT PO2 AND OTHER CONDITIONS THAT WERE MET (IF NOT REQUIRED) BEFORE THE EVOLUTION OF EUKARYOTES AND LIFE LIKE US."

ALTHOUGH THE MASS GAIN FROM ICE SHEETS WILL DOMINATE A CENTURY FROM NOW, AT THE MOMENT DYNAMICAL ADJUSTMENTS OF THE OCEAN TO VARIABLE WINDS AS WELL AS THE CONTRIBUTION OF VERTICAL LAND MOTION (VLM) CAUSE MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT DEVIATIONS OF REGIONAL RELATIVE SEA LEVEL AWAY FROM THE GLOBAL MEAN. IT HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN SEVERAL REGIONS THAT THESE DYNAMICAL CHANGES IN MEAN SEA LEVEL EXCEED GLOBAL MEAN SEA LEVEL RISE BY A FACTOR OF THREE TO FOUR TIMES FOR PERIODS OF TWENTY YEARS OR LONGER. ONE EXAMPLE IS IN THE WESTERN PACIFIC, AND STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THIS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PACIFIC DECADAL OSCILLATION (PDO). WITH GROWING EVIDENCE FOR A CHANGE IN THE STATE OF THE PDO, THE WEST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES MAY BE IN STORE FOR RAPIDLY RISING SEA LEVEL OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY YEARS, OR LONGER. IT IS IMPORTANT TO QUANTIFY THE POSSIBLE SIZE. WE PROPOSE TO STUDY BOTH THE DYNAMICAL OCEAN SIGNAL, AND THE VERTICAL LAND MOTION IN COMBINATION, AS IT IS RELATIVE SEA LEVEL CHANGE THAT IS MOST IMPORTANT TO SOCIETY. VERTICAL LAND MOTION INCLUDES ONGOING GLACIAL ISOSTATIC ADJUSTMENT (FOR WHICH SEVERAL MODELS ARE AVAILABLE), SEDIMENT COMPACTION, TECTONIC SIGNALS AS WELL AS ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES DUE TO GROUNDWATER AND OIL EXTRACTION, AND POPULATION GROWTH. THE VLM HAS BEEN LITTLE STUDIED IN TERMS OF THE EFFECT ON REGIONAL SEA LEVEL. THUS, WE WILL EVALUATE IT ALONG THE ENTIRE PACIFIC, GULF, AND ATLANTIC COAST OF NORTH AMERICA USING GPS AND INSAR, WITH A FOCUS ON LARGE AND IMPORTANT COASTAL CITIES: SAN FRANCISCO, LOS ANGELES, SEATTLE, NEW YORK CITY, HOUSTON/GALVESTON, AND MIAMI. THE METHODS WE WILL USE ARE BRIEFLY SUMMARIZED BELOW: 1. WE WILL IDENTIFY THE RELEVANT MECHANISMS FORCING DECADAL- TO MULTI-DECADAL VARIATIONS IN REGIONAL MEAN SEA LEVEL AT SELECT LOCATIONS AROUND THE UNITED STATES BASED ON ANALYSIS OF TIDE GAUGE RECORDS AND A REGIONAL OCEAN MODEL NESTED WITHIN A GLOBAL GENERAL CIRCULATION MODEL. WE WILL QUANTIFY HOW WELL THE REGIONAL MODEL SEA SURFACE HEIGHT (AND/OR BOTTOM PRESSURE) MATCHES THE OBSERVED RECORD FROM TIDE GAUGES, QUANTIFY HOW THE VARIATIONS ARE RELATED TO LARGER-SCALE CLIMATE MODES (E.G., PDO, EL NI O, NORTH ATLANTIC OSCILLATION, ATLANTIC MUTIDECADAL VARIABILITY, ETC), AND ADJUST THE REGIONAL MODEL TO BETTER MATCH BOTH THE MAGNITUDE AND TIMING OF OBSERVED SEA LEVEL EVENTS. THIS WILL BE DONE VIA A COMBINATION OF REGIONAL SCALING, ADJUSTING FORCING PARAMETERS, AND/OR ADJUSTING SELECT PARAMETERS IN THE MODEL. ONCE THE REGIONAL MODEL IS VALIDATED, WE WILL USE PAST WIND RECORDS REPRESENTING PAST STATES OF THE CLIMATE SYSTEM (I.E., PDO WIND VARIABILITY FROM THE 1950S-1970S, ENSO WIND VARIABILITY FROM THE 1980S-1990S), AND FORCE THE MODEL TO MAKE PREDICTIONS OF POSSIBLE SEA LEVEL EXCURSIONS FOR THE NEXT TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS. 2. WE WILL UTILIZE GPS AND INSAR TO DETERMINE VERTICAL DISPLACEMENTS IN THE COASTAL REGIONS OF THE AFOREMENTIONED CITIES. INSAR PROVIDES DETAILED, COMPREHENSIVE BUT LOCALIZED OBSERVATIONS OF DISPLACEMENT IN THE SATELLITE LINE OF SIGHT AT PIXELS A FEW METERS APART. GPS WILL BE USED TO CALIBRATE INSAR, REDUCE INSAR ATMOSPHERIC AND BASELINE ERRORS AND DETERMINE INSAR RANGE RELATIVE TO THE (CM) MASS CENTER OF EARTH, THE IDENTICAL REFERENCE FRAME THAT SEA LEVEL FROM SATELLITE ALTIMETRY IS DETERMINED IN. INSAR MEASUREMENTS FROM ASCENDING AND DESCENDING PASSES WILL BE FURTHERMORE COMBINED WITH GPS TO DETERMINE TIME SERIES OF DISPLACEMENTS IN THREE DIMENSIONS. THE ACCURACY OF INSAR RELATIVE POSITION ESTIMATES OF SITES SEPARATED BY MORE THAN 50 KM WILL BE EVALUATED WITH GPS, PROVIDING AN INDEPENDENT CHECK OF THE ATMOSPHERE DELAY MODELS USED TO REDUCE THE INSAR DATA THE PROPOSAL TEAM INCLUDES EXPERTS ON REGIONAL OCEAN MODELING, TIDE GAUGES AND WIND-FORCED INTERANNUAL AND DECADAL-SCALE VARIATIONS IN SEA LEVEL, GPS, AND INSAR."

THESE  DELTA-DOPED  DETECTORS HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF DEPLOYMENT DEMONSTRATING GREATER THAN 5X THE SENSITIVITY OF THE DETECTORS USED BY GALEX. SPARCS WILL PAVE THE WAY FOR THEIR APPLICATION IN MISSIONS LIKE LUVOIR OR HABEX. EDUCATION: THE SPARCS RESEARCH PROGRAM WILL TRAIN FUTURE SCIENTISTS AND MISSION LEADERS BY MENTORING FIVE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS, THREE GRADUATE STUDENTS, AND TWO POST-DOCTORAL SCHOLARS THROUGHOUT ALL ASPECTS OF THE MISSION, INCLUDING ENGINEERING, SCIENCE, DATA MANAGEMENT AND OUTREACH. RELEVANCE TO NASA: THE SPARCS MISSION WILL ADDRESS NASA S GOALS OF IDENTIFYING THE CHARACTERISTICS AND DISTRIBUTION OF POTENTIALLY HABITABLE ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING HZ PLANET HOSTS LIKE PROXIMA AND TRAPPIST-1. SPARCS WILL ALSO BE CAPABLE OF  TARGETOF- OPPORTUNITY  UV OBSERVATIONS OF NASA S TESS YIELD OF ROCKY PLANETS IN M DWARF HZS, SOME OF THE FIRST HZ PLANETS TO BE SPECTROSCOPICALLY CHARACTERIZED BY JWST.

AS A RESULT, WE KNOW RELATIVELY LITTLE ABOUT SHOCK EFFECTS FROM SOLAR SYSTEM IMPACT EVENTS OLDER THAN 4150 MA. 40AR/39AR AGES OF IMPACTS IN ORDINARY CHONDRITES (TURNER 1969; BOGARD ET AL. 1976; TURNER 1978; BOGARD 1995; KOROCHANTSEVA ET AL. 2007; SWINDLE ET AL. 2009; SWINDLE ET AL. 2014) DEMONSTRATE THAT MANY CHONDRITES HAVE EXPERIENCED IMPACT EVENTS>4150 MA. THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE SHOCK EFFECTS, SHOCK CONDITIONS, ANNEALING AND IMPACT AGES IN THE EARLIEST SHOCKS RECORDED IN ORDINARY CHONDRITES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND IMPACT PROCESSES IN THE FIRST 400 MA OF SOLAR SYSTEM HISTORY. SHOCK EFFECTS IN METEORITES ARE WELL PRESERVED IN RAPIDLY QUENCHED SAMPLES, BUT THEY CAN BE PARTIALLY OR COMPLETELY ANNEALED AFTER SHOCK OR DURING THERMAL METAMORPHISM. DEFORMATION AND TRANSFORMATIONAL MICROSTRUCTURES THAT SURVIVE CAN BE USED TO INVESTIGATE BOTH SHOCK AND POST-SHOCK PROCESSES. 40AR/39AR AGES PROVIDE A CHRONOLOGICAL HISTORY OF IMPACT EVENTS IN METEORITES IN ADDITION TO CONSTRAINTS ON TIME-TEMPERATURE HISTORIES (SWINDLE ET AL. 2014). WE PROPOSE TO PERFORM DETAILED MINERALOGICAL AND MICROSTRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF CHONDRITES SHOCKED IN THE OLDEST POST-ACCRETION IMPACT PROCESSES. WE WILL USE POLARIZED-LIGHT MICROSCOPY TO CLASSIFY THE SHOCK STAGE AND MAP OUT LOCAL SHOCK MELTING AND TRANSFORMATION IN SAMPLES THAT HAVE 40AR/39AR AGES>4150 MA. WE WILL USE RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY AND SYNCHROTRON X-RAY DIFFRACTION TO IDENTIFY HIGH-PRESSURE MINERALS FORMED BY SHOCK. WE WILL USE BACKSCATTERED ELECTRON IMAGING AND ENERGY DISPERSIVE ANALYSIS WITH OUR FIELD-EMISSION SEMS TO CHARACTERIZE NANO-SCALE DEFORMATION, MELTING AND REACTION MICROSTRUCTURES. WE WILL USE THE FOCUSED-ION-BEAM LIFT-OUT TECHNIQUE TO PREPARE SAMPLES FOR ANALYTICAL TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (TEM). TEM WILL BE USED TO IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE NANO-MINERALOGY, NANOMETER-SCALE REACTION STRUCTURES, DEFORMATION MICROSTRUCTURES AND ANNEALING EFFECTS. FINALLY, WE WILL USE 40AR/39AR DATING TO REFINE THE AGES OF SOME OF THE OLDEST SHOCKED SAMPLES TO BETTER EVALUATE THE TIMING OF EARLY IMPACT PROCESSES. THESE DATA, COMBINED WITH PUBLISHED 40AR/39AR AGE DATA, WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE A DETAILED RECORD OF SHOCK EFFECTS, SHOCK CONDITIONS AND POST-SHOCK ANNEALING IN THE OLDEST SHOCKED MATERIALS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. THIS DATA WILL PROVIDE NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE ROLE OF IMPACTS AND SHOCK IN THE METAMORPHISM OF ASTEROIDS IN THE EARLY HISTORY OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM."

PREVIOUS SELF-SHIELDING MODELS HAVE USED A WAVELENGTH-INDEPENDENT APPROXIMATION KNOWN AS  SHIELDING FUNCTIONS  TO COMPUTE O ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION IN THE NEBULA. THROUGH PREVIOUS NASA GRANTS, WE HAVE COMPILED A SET OF VERY HIGH QUALITY FUV CROSS SECTIONS FOR CO ISOTOPOLOGUES. WITH THESE DATA, WE CAN QUANTITATIVELY EVALUATE CO SELF-SHIELDING FOR A RANGE OF NEBULAR LOCATIONS AND FOR ANY STELLAR FUV SPECTRUM. TO DO THIS WE MUST FIRST COMPLETE THE REDUCTION OF OUR ISOTOPIC CO CROSS SECTION DATA. WE ALSO NEED QUANTUM YIELD MEASUREMENTS FOR THE VERY IMPORTANT CO E(0) BAND. AS A PARALLEL EFFORT, AND WITH COLLABORATORS, WE WILL DEVELOP A COUPLED-CHANNEL (CSE) MODEL FOR CO ISOTOPOLOGUE CROSS SECTIONS INFORMED BY OUR DATA THAT WILL ALLOW US TO MODEL CO ISOTOPOLOGUE ABSORPTION SPECTRA AT THE FULL RANGE OF TEMPERATURES NEEDED FOR SOLAR NEBULA MODELING. WITH OUR CO ISOTOPIC CROSS SECTIONS, WE WILL EVALUATE O AND C ISOTOPE EFFECTS DUE TO SELF-SHIELDING. A CSE MODEL ALREADY EXISTS FOR N2, AND WILL BE USED TO MODEL N2 SELF-SHIELDING TO PREDICT D15 FOR HCN AND NH3 PRODUCED PHOTOCHEMICALLY IN THE NEBULA. OUR NEBULA MODELS WILL BE RUN WITH SEVERAL FORMS OF TURBULENT TRANSPORT TO REFLECT THE RECENT WORK ARGUING THAT THE MAGNETOROTATIONAL INSTABILITY MAY BE LESS IMPORTANT THAN PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED DUE TO DISSIPATIVE EFFECTS. FINALLY, WE WILL MAKE A PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF THE TRANSFER OF O ISOTOPE SIGNATURES IN WATER TO NEBULAR SILICATES. PROPOSED RESEARCH: 1. O ISOTOPES. THIS TASK IS COMPOSED OF SEVERAL SUBTASKS. I) COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF OUR ISOTOPIC CO CROSS SECTION DATA. THIS IS IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE US AND FRANCE. II) MEASURE ISOTOPE-DEPENDENT QUANTUM YIELDS FOR THE E(0) BAND OF CO. THIS IS THE STRONGEST DISSOCIATING CO BAND, AND THE PRESENT UNCERTAINTY IN QUANTUM YIELDS IS INTRODUCING LARGE UNCERTAINTIES INTO NEBULAR MODEL RESULTS. III) MEASURE THE ABSORPTION SPECTRUM OF 12C16O AT 1000 K. IV) DEVELOP A CSE MODEL FOR CO CROSS SECTIONS FROM 90 TO 110 NM. THIS WILL PERFORMED IN COLLABORATION WITH EUROPEAN COLLABORATORS. V) RUN SOLAR NEBULA MODEL WITH FULL O ISOTOPE CO CROSS SECTIONS. 2. C ISOTOPES. ADD C ISOTOPES TO SOLAR NEBULA MODEL. RUN USING FULL CO CROSS SECTIONS. 3. N ISOTOPES. EVALUATION OF 15N ENRICHMENT DUE TO N2 SELF-SHIELDING IN THE SOLAR NEBULA. THE D15N ENRICHMENT OF THE TERRESTRIAL PLANETS AND METEORITES INCLUDING HOT SPOTS IS WELL KNOWN. WE WILL MODEL THESE EFFECTS DUE TO N2 SELF-SHIELDING USING HIGHLY PRECISE N2 CROSS SECTIONS. 4. NEBULAR SILICATES. EVALUATE O ISOTOPE EXCHANGE OF NEBULAR WATER WITH SILICATES AND CAIS. TO EXPLAIN THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM VIA SELFSHIELDING, NEBULAR SILICATES HAD TO EXCHANGE O WITH H2O. WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY ARGUED THAT SUCH EXCHANGE IS SLOW FOR CAIS. HERE WE WILL EVALUATE EXCHANGE QUANTITATIVELY FOR CHONDRULES AND CAIS."

GOALS OF THE PROPOSED WORK INCLUDE: 1) DEMONSTRATING THE UTILITY OF LASER MICROPROBE 40AR/39AR DATING OF ENTRAINED PLAGIOCLASE XENOCRYSTS FOR ESTABLISHING PRECISE IMPACT MELT AGES; 2) ESTABLISHING THE AGES OF IMPACT MELTING EVENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MELT BRECCIAS COLLECTED AT THE APOLLO 15 AND 16 LANDING SITES; 3) ADDING TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF VARIATIONS IN THE DIFFUSIVITY OF AR ISOTOPES IN LUNAR PLAGIOCLASES; 4) QUANTIFYING 40AR/39AR APPARENT AGE GRADIENTS - OR LACK OF GRADIENTS - IN COARSE PLAGIOCLASE XENOCRYSTS AND COARSE PLAGIOCLASE CRYSTALS IN XENOLITHS; 5) CONSTRAINING THE PLAUSIBLE MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE-DURATION RELATIONSHIPS OF THE EVENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THE STUDIED BRECCIAS THROUGH THERMAL-KINETIC MODELING OF THE ACQUIRED UVLAMP DATA; AND 6) EVALUATING THE EXTENT TO WHICH 40AR/39AR GEOCHRONOLOGY OF APOLLO 15 AND 16 IMPACT MELT SAMPLES CAN BE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE ACCURATE AND PRECISE CONSTRAINTS ON THE AGE OF THE IMBRIUM IMPACT."

MUCH OF THE ATMOSPHERIC CHARACTERIZATION WORK TO DATE HAS FOCUSED ON RESULTS FROM LOW DISPERSION SPECTROSCOPY (LDS) AND PHOTOMETRY FROM SPACE-BASED INSTRUMENTS LIKE THE HUBBLE AND SPITZER SPACE TELESCOPES. WHILE WE OWE MUCH OF OUR EXOPLANETARY ATMOSPHERE INSIGHTS FROM SUCH OBSERVATIONS, THEY ARE LIMITED IN THE ACCESSIBILITY OF CERTAIN MOLECULES AND ATMOSPHERIC REGIONS PROBED, DUE TO LOW RESOLUTION AND SPARSE WAVELENGTH COVERAGE. JWST WILL SOLVE MANY OF THESE PROBLEMS, HOWEVER IT IS A LIMITED RESOURCE AND IT IS PRUDENT THAT WE HAVE INDEPENDENT AND ROBUST ALTERNATIVE METHODS THAT LEVERAGE NUMEROUS GROUND-BASED FACILITIES AN EXCITING EMERGING APPROACH FOR CHARACTERIZING ATMOSPHERES IS HIGH DISPERSION CROSS-CORRELATION SPECTROSCOPY (HDCCS). HDCCS LEVERAGES THE LARGE NUMBER OF MOLECULAR LINES ATTAINABLE AT HIGH RESOLUTIONS (R>30,000) AND LARGE GROUND BASES APERTURES TO ROBUSTLY DETECT MOLECULES. THIS IS THE ONLY METHOD TO HAVE ROBUSTLY DETECTED CARBON-BASED MOLECULES IN TRANSITING EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERES. HOWEVER, LITTLE WORK HAS FOCUSED ON THE ABILITY TO CONSTRAINT THE ABUNDANCES OF MOLECULES, VERTICAL TEMPERATURE STRUCTURES, AND OTHER FUNDAMENTAL ATMOSPHERIC PROPERTIES FROM HDCCS DATA IN A RIGOROUS WAY. ONE OF THE PRIMARY CHALLENGES IN DOING SO IS PLACING THE HDCCS WITHIN A ROBUST ATMOSPHERIC RETRIEVAL FRAMEWORK, A WIDELY APPLIED KEY TOOL IN LDS DATA INTERPRETATION. OUR TEAM HAS RECENTLY PIONEERED PLACING HDCCS AND LDS WITHIN IN A COMMON RETRIEVAL FRAMEWORK TO MAXIMIZE ATMOSPHERIC CONSTRAINTS. ADDITIONALLY, RECENTLY COMMISSIONED INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS CARMENES, GIANO, ISHELL, IGRINS, AND ESPRESSO HAVE GREATLY IMPROVED THE PROSPECTS OF ATMOSPHERIC CONSTRAINTS FROM HDCCS OBSERVATIONS.

WE WILL EXPLORE THESE OBJECTIVES WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF ALL TRANSIT GEOMETRIES AND WAVELENGTH REGIMES, INCLUDING TRANSMISSION, EMISSION, PHASE RESOLVED, AND REFLECTED LIGHT. OUR TEAM IS UNIQUELY SUITED TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS BOTH FROM A HDDCCS AND LDS DATA ANALYSIS PERSPECTIVE AS WELL AS THE THEORETICAL MODELING.

ON SOLID HZ EXOPLANETS, CHEMICAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN GASES, SURFACE WATER AND ROCKS COULD AFFECT THE COMPOSITION OF VOLATILE-BEARING PLANETARY ENVELOPES. THE ATMOSPHERIC CO2 ABUNDANCE IS SET BY A BALANCE BETWEEN SINKS AND A SUPPLY THROUGH DEGASSING. SINKS OF CO2 TO LIQUID AND SOLID PHASES ARE AFFECTED BY DISSOLUTION IN WATERS AND PRECIPITATION OF CARBONATES AND/OR CLATHRATES, WHICH ARE INFLUENCED BY THE TEMPERATURE, COMPOSITION AND ACIDITY (PH) OF SOLUTIONS. IN TURN, CHEMISTRY OF AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS IS MAINLY AFFECTED BY THE COMPOSITION OF ALTERING ROCKS AND DISSOLUTION OF ATMOSPHERIC GASES. THE APPARENT DIVERSITY OF STAR COMPOSITIONS TOGETHER WITH COMPLEX SCENARIOS OF PLANET FORMATION AND EVOLUTION IMPLY A WIDE RANGE OF ROCK COMPOSITIONS. THESE COUPLED INFLUENCES COULD BE QUANTIFIED BY METHODS OF EQUILIBRIUM CHEMICAL THERMODYNAMICS CONSTRAINED BY FUNDAMENTAL CONSTANTS AND MASS BALANCES IN GAS-WATER-SOLID SYSTEMS ON HZ EXOPLANETS. THIS STUDY IS AIMED AT UNDERSTANDING EFFECTS OF ROCK COMPOSITION AND WATER/CO2/ROCK RATIOS ON AQUEOUS ACID-BASE CHEMISTRY, SECONDARY MINERALOGY AND ABUNDANCE OF ATMOSPHERIC CO2 ON HZ EXOPLANETS.

SINCE THE GEOLOGIC MAP WAS COMPLETED AND PUBLISHED IN 2011, WE HAVE BEEN ADDING ADDITIONAL DATASETS TO THE DATABASE, INCLUDING: 1) ADAPTIVE OPTICS-DERIVED, EARTH-BASED TELESCOPIC MAPS OF IO S HOTSPOTS PRODUCED BY IMKE DE PATER AND HER COLLEAGUES, STEREO DIGITAL TERRAIN MODELS (DTMS) OF IO PRODUCED BY OLIVER WHITE AND PAUL SCHENK, REGIONAL SCALE GALILEO SOLID STATE IMAGER (SSI) MOSAICS AND DERIVED GEOLOGIC MAPS PUBLISHED BY MYSELF AND COLLEAGUES IN PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS, HOT SPOT POWER AND TEMPERATURE INFORMATION DERIVED FROM VARIOUS DATABASES, AND MODEL RESULTS OF INTERIOR HEATING DERIVED FROM THE GLOBAL MAP BY CHRISTOPHER HAMILTON ET AL.

THE CONCEPT IS TO HAVE ALL USEFUL GALILEO-BASED AND POST-GALILEO-DERIVED DATA OF JUPITER S VOLCANIC MOON IO ORGANIZED IN A GIS PLATFORM, WHERE ALL OF THE DATA ARE SPATIALLY CO-REGISTERED. THIS WOULD ENABLE EASY STUDY OF SPECIFIC VOLCANIC FEATURES ACROSS A VARIETY OF DATA SETS.

ANOXYGENIC PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN PARTICULAR IS IMPORTANT FOR THE EARLY ANOXIC EARTH AND FOR EXOPLANETS, WHERE ANOXIA MIGHT BE QUITE COMMON. IF THE EVOLUTION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS VIA A FEW \'RELATIVELY EASY\' STEPS IS POSSIBLE, WE MIGHT EXPECT TO FIND MANY WORLDS WITH PHOTOSYNTHETIC LIFE, WHETHER OR NOT OXYGENIC PHOTOSYNTHESIS EVER EMERGED. OTHERWISE, WE MIGHT EXPECT PHOTOSYNTHESIS TO BE RARE IN THE UNIVERSE. WE PROPOSE THAT A PLAUSIBLE EVOLUTIONARY INTERMEDIATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF (ANOXYGENIC) PHOTOSYNTHESIS WAS A CHEMOLITHOTROPHIC BACTERIUM THAT EXTRACTED ENERGY FROM ENVIRONMENTAL REDOX GRADIENTS. ONE WAY TO EXTRACT MORE ENERGY FROM A REDOX GRADIENT IS TO INSERT A PHOTOSYNTHETIC REACTION CENTER (RC) INTO THE ELECTRON TRANSPORT PATHWAY. THIS GIVES A CHEMOLITHOTROPH A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, ALLOWING IT TO USE LESS-REDUCING DONORS AND/OR LESS-OXIDIZING ACCEPTORS. A SHALLOW GRADIENT   OR EVEN AN UPHILL ELECTRON TRANSFER   COULD BE PROFITABLE TO AN ORGANISM USING LIGHT TO GENERATE A STEEPER GRADIENT, THUS PUMPING MORE PROTONS PER ELECTRON TRANSPORTED, AND MAKING MORE ATP. IN THIS VIEW, THE REACTION CENTER ALLOWS THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIGHT-ASSISTED LITHOTROPHY, I.E., PHOTO/ CHEMOLITHOTROPHY. OBJECTIVES: THERE ARE NO KNOWN EXAMPLES OF THE PHOTO/CHEMOLITHOTROPH WE INVOKE IN THIS EVOLUTIONARY TRAJECTORY. WE PROPOSE TO TEST THIS IDEA BY CREATING SUCH ORGANISMS. WE WILL USE THE PRIMITIVE PHOTOTROPH, HELIOBACTERIUM MODESTICALDUM, AS OUR STARTING POINT, BECAUSE IT IS EXPERIMENTALLY MUCH EASIER TO TRANSFER A FEW GENES REQUIRED TO CONFER LITHOTROPHY RATHER THAN THE MANY GENES REQUIRED FOR PHOTOTROPHY. WE HAVE DEVELOPED GENETIC TOOLS TO EDIT THE H. MODESTICALDUM CHROMOSOME USING ITS ENDOGENOUS DNA MODIFICATION SYSTEMS; THIS ALLOWS US TO REMOVE AND ADD GENES AT WILL. WE PROPOSE TO BREAK THE EXISTING CYCLIC ELECTRON FLOW PATHWAY BY REMOVING A SPECIFIC ENZYME (NADH DEHYDROGENASE) AND ADDING A SULFIDE:QUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE (SQR) TO ALLOW IT OXIDIZE SULFIDE TO SULFUR. THE ORGANISM CAN ALREADY REDUCE PROTONS TO MOLECULAR HYDROGEN (H2). THEREFORE, IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO OXIDIZE (EXTERNAL) SULFIDE AND REDUCE (INTERNAL) PROTONS, AIDED BY LIGHT, AND IN THE PROCESS CREATE A PROTON ELECTROCHEMICAL GRADIENT FOR ATP SYNTHESIS   THUS, EXTRACTING ENERGY FROM A REDOX GRADIENT THAT IS ENERGETICALLY UNFAVORABLE. WE WILL TEST THE GROWTH OF THE ENGINEERED ORGANISMS UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS AND QUANTIFY THEIR ABILITY TO (1) USE SULFIDE (S-2) AS ELECTRON DONOR, (2) REDUCE PROTONS TO H2, (3) EXTRACT ENERGY IN THE PROCESS, AND (4) FIX CO2. WE WILL ALSO TEST THE IDEA THAT AUTOTROPHY CAN BE CONFERRED BY ADDING ATP-CITRATE LYASE, WHICH IS THE ONLY ENZYME MISSING FROM THE REVERSE TCA CYCLE IN H. MODESTICALDUM. WE CAN MAKE SEVERAL COMBINATIONS OF THESE GENETIC MODIFICATIONS IN ORDER TO CONSTRUCT MULTIPLE POSSIBLE EVOLUTIONARY INTERMEDIATES. LASTLY, WE WILL ASSESS THE ISOTOPE SIGNATURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW SULFIDE OXIDATION, PROTON REDUCTION, AND CO2 FIXATION PATHWAYS AND COMPARE THEM WITH KNOWN METABOLIC FRACTIONATIONS AND WITH THE GEOLOGIC RECORDS. SIGNIFICANCE: THIS WORK IS RELEVANT FOR NASA EXOBIOLOGY BECAUSE IT DIRECTLY INVESTIGATES TWO RESEARCH TOPICS IN THE 2015 ASTROBIOLOGY STRATEGY: EARLY LIFE AND INCREASING COMPLEXITY AND CO-EVOLUTION OF LIFE AND THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL EXPERIMENTALLY EXPLORE THE ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF A KEY METABOLIC STRATEGY, ANOXYGENIC PHOTOTROPHY, IN THE CONTEXT OF ENVIRONMENTAL REDOX GRADIENTS. OUR RESULTS WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE POTENTIAL BIOSIGNATURES OF THE METABOLIC STRATEGIES WE EXPLORE IN THE ENGINEERED H. MODESTICALDUM STRAINS. THE RESULTS WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR UNDERSTANDING THE EVOLUTION OF LIFE ON THE EARLY EARTH AND FOR THE DIVERSITY OF BIOSIGNATURES THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM NOVEL METABOLISMS."

ALTHOUGH MANY STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE MAJOR OXYGEN PULSES THAT BOOKEND THE PROTEROZOIC EON, FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS PERSIST ABOUT GLOBAL REDOX DURING THE MIDDLE CHAPTERS OF EARTH HISTORY. THIS IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE THIS MID- PROTEROZOIC INTERVAL (#tilde#1.8 TO 0.8 BILLION YEARS AGO) WAS CHARACTERIZED BY A MAJOR DIVERSIFICATION OF EARLY EUKARYOTES THAT SET THE STAGE FOR SUBSEQUENT ANIMAL EVOLUTION. EXISTING CONSTRAINTS ON ATMOSPHERIC PO2 RANGE MORE THAN TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE, HINDERING OUR ABILITY TO DECIPHER THE ROLE THAT OXYGEN PLAYED IN DRIVING KEY MILESTONES IN EUKARYOTIC EVOLUTION. URANIUM (U) ISOTOPES CAN POTENTIALLY PROVIDE CRITICAL NEW CONSTRAINTS BECAUSE THE U ISOTOPE COMPOSITION OF SEAWATER WHICH CAN BE RECORDED IN MARINE CARBONATES IS CONTROLLED BY THE GLOBAL EXTENT OF SEAFLOOR ANOXIA. DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF THE U ISOTOPE PROXY IN CARBONATES WAS THE SUBJECT OF PRIOR SUPPORT TO OUR GROUP FROM NASA EXOBIOLOGY, AND THE CURRENT PROPOSAL IS A LOGICAL EXTENSION OF THE PIONEERING WORK THAT RESULTED FROM THAT SUPPORT. OVER THE PAST YEAR, OUR TEAM HAS AMASSED A LARGE U ISOTOPE DATASET FOR CARBONATES OF MID-PROTEROZOIC AGE. SURPRISINGLY, U ISOTOPE VALUES (−0.40   0.28   [1?]) ARE SIMILAR TO MODERN SEAWATER, SUGGESTING THAT LARGE PORTIONS OF THE MID-PROTEROZOIC OCEANS MIGHT HAVE BEEN OXYGENATED. HOWEVER, THERE ARE STILL MAJOR GAPS IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE U ISOTOPE SYSTEM THAT PRECLUDE DEFINITIVE INTERPRETATION. U ISOTOPE VALUES IN THIS RANGE COULD ALSO BE CONSISTENT WITH A LARGELY SUBOXIC OR ANOXIC, IRON-RICH (FERRUGINOUS) OCEAN. UNFORTUNATELY, EXISTING CONSTRAINTS ON U ISOTOPE BEHAVIOR UNDER SUBOXIC AND FERRUGINOUS CONDITIONS ARE LIMITED TO JUST A FEW DATA POINTS.

OUR PROPOSED WORK INVOLVES: 1) BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC U-REDUCTION EXPERIMENTS TO CONSTRAIN FRACTIONATION FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH A VARIETY OF U-REDUCTION PATHWAYS IN THE PRESENCE OF CA; 2) COMPARISON OF U ISOTOPE SEDIMENT PROFILES FROM TWO MODERN SUBOXIC ANALOGUES; AND 3) WATER AND SEDIMENT U ISOTOPE MEASUREMENTS FROM TWO MODERN FERRUGINOUS ENVIRONMENTS. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL INVESTIGATE BOTH MICROBIALLY-MEDIATED AND ABIOTIC U-REDUCTION UNDER A VARIETY OF CONDITIONS, FOCUSING ON HOW CA CONCENTRATIONS (WHICH AFFECTS U-SPECIATION) AND THE REDUCTANT (H2S, FE(II)AQ, MICROBIAL FE-REDUCERS) INFLUENCE U ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION. WE WILL CONSTRAIN U ISOTOPE FRACTION UNDER SUBOXIC AND ANOXIC CONDITIONS USING PUBLICLY-AVAILABLE ODP CORES FROM TWO PROMINENT UPWELLING ZONES: THE OMAN AND PERU MARGINS. SEDIMENT PROFILES AT THESE SITES RECORD EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION OF THE OXYGEN MINIMUM ZONE ON MILLENNIAL TIMESCALES, ALLOWING US TO INVESTIGATE U ISOTOPE BEHAVIOR UNDER A RANGE OF LOW-OXYGEN, LOW-SULFIDE CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED IN THESE BASINS OVER THE PAST 30,000 YEARS. FINALLY, WE WILL EXPLORE U ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION UNDER FERRUGINOUS CONDITIONS IN TWO FERRUGINOUS LAKE ANALOGS, CANYON LAKE (MICHIGAN) AND KABUNO BAY (EAST AFRICA). THESE SITES PROVIDE AN IDEAL ANALOGUE FOR STUDYING U ISOTOPE BEHAVIOR UNDER FERRUGINOUS CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN PREVALENT IN THE PROTEROZOIC OCEANS. THIS EXPERIMENTAL AND MODERN ANALOGUE APPROACH WILL SUBSTANTIALLY REFINE OUR ABILITY TO INTERPRET THE U ISOTOPE RECORD, ELIMINATING CRITICAL  BLIND SPOTS  IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF U ISOTOPE GEOCHEMISTRY. MOREOVER, WHEN COMBINED WITH OUR EXISTING MID-PROTEROZOIC DATASET, THIS STUDY WILL PROVIDE ROBUST NEW CONSTRAINTS ON THE REDOX LANDSCAPE OF THE MID-PROTEROZOIC OCEANS, THUS ALLOWING A FUNDAMENTAL RE-EVALUATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OXYGENATION AND EVOLUTION ON THE EARLY EARTH."

ONE TECHNIQUE USED TO EXAMINE THE CURRENT IMPACT RATE IS TO LOOK FOR SURFACE CHANGES IN A BEFORE AND AFTER IMAGE WITH SIMILAR LIGHTING, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS A TEMPORAL IMAGE PAIR. RECENTLY, ANALYSIS OF TEMPORAL IMAGES ACQUIRED WITH THE LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (LRO) NARROW ANGLE CAMERA (NAC) AND WIDE ANGLE CAMERA (WAC) [3] HAS REVEALED HUNDREDS OF NEWLY FORMED IMPACT CRATERS AND THOUSANDS OF OTHER SURFACE CHANGES [4,5]. ONE LIMITATION TO THIS TECHNIQUE IS THE REQUIREMENT THAT TWO IMAGES MUST COVER THE SAME SURFACE AREA UNDER SIMILAR ILLUMINATION CONDITIONS. BY LEVERAGING IMAGES FROM MULTIPLE MISSIONS, WE CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF IMAGES THAT SATISFY THESE RESTRICTIONS AS WELL AS INCREASE THE TIME BETWEEN THE OBSERVATIONS. FIRST, WE WILL COMPARE RECENTLY DIGITIZED APOLLO METRIC PHOTOGRAPHS [6] FROM THE 1970''S TO LRO WAC IMAGES WITH SIMILAR LIGHTING CONDITIONS. NEXT, WE WILL COMPARE THE NEAR GLOBAL IMAGE DATASET FROM THE SELENE TERRAIN CAMERA (TC) ACQUIRED BETWEEN 2008 AND 2009 TO A SUBSET OF OVER A MILLION PUBLICLY AVAILABLE LRO NAC IMAGES [7]. THESE MULTI-MISSION COMPARISON WILL ENABLE A MORE ROBUST ESTIMATE OF THE CURRENT CRATERING RATE ON THE MOON FOR CRATERS RANGING BETWEEN 20-100 M, WHICH IS A KEY DIAMETER RANGE WHEN CALCULATING MODEL AGES OF YOUNG SURFACES USING CRATER SIZE FREQUENCY STATISTICS. FURTHERMORE, ANALYSIS OF THESE RECENT SURFACE CHANGES WILL ALSO PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE CRATER FORMATION PROCESS, THE DISTRIBUTION OF EJECTA AND RESULTING RAYS, AS WELL AS AID IN QUANTIFYING THE NUMBER OF CORRESPONDING SECONDARY CHANGES THAT FORM WITH EACH EVENT [5]. METHODOLOGY: WE WILL FIRST SELECT WAC IMAGES ACQUIRED UNDER SIMILAR LIGHTING CONDITION TO THAT OF THE METRIC PHOTOGRAPHS. WE WILL THEN MAP PROJECT AND CO-REGISTER EACH WAC IMAGE TO THE DIGITAL METRIC PHOTOGRAPH CORRECTING ANY PLANIMETRIC OFFSETS BETWEEN THE TWO DATASETS AND ALIGN ALL THE FEATURES TO WITHIN A PIXEL. THEN, BY LEVERAGING IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED BY OUR TEAM TO PROCESS BEFORE AND AFTER LRO NAC IMAGE PAIRS [5], WE WILL SCAN AND IDENTIFY SURFACE CHANGES IN THE TEMPORAL PAIRS. THE SAME TECHNIQUE WILL BE APPLIED TO LRO NAC AND TC IMAGES. DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE NAC AND TC DATASET, A SEMI-AUTOMATIC CHANGE DETECTION PROGRAM WILL BE USED TO LOCATE CHANGES BASED ON REFLECTANCE VARIATIONS AND CHANGES IN SURFACE TEXTURE. THE PROGRAM WAS USED IN [5] AND PROVIDES A LIST OF POTENTIAL NEW FEATURES FOR MANUAL INSPECTION AND CLASSIFICATION. THIS APPROACH REDUCES THE TIME TO MANUALLY INSPECT IMAGE PAIRS BY PROVIDING CROPPED CUTOUTS WITH THE PUTATIVE CHANGES ENABLING RAPID AND SYSTEMATIC PROCESSING OF THOUSANDS OF TEMPORAL PAIRS. BY MEASURING AND TRACKING THE SIZE DISTRIBUTION, SPATIAL COVERAGE, AND TIME BETWEEN EACH TEMPORAL PAIR, WE WILL DERIVE A NEW IMPACT RATE FOR CRATERS<#tilde#100 M. RELEVANCE: THIS PROPOSAL IS IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE LDAP REQUEST FOR INVESTIGATIONS FOCUSED ON LUNAR CHANGE DETECTION. OUR TEAM WILL IDENTIFY, CLASSIFY AND DOCUMENT SURFACE CHANGES USING BEFORE IMAGES PROVIDED BY APOLLO METRIC CAMERA [6] AND SELENE TC [7] AND AFTER IMAGES PROVIDED BY THE LRO NAC AND WAC [3].

PUTATIVE AQUEOUS PROCESSES SHOULD HAVE AFFECTED COMPOSITIONS OF THE LITHOSPHERE AND THE ATMOSPHERE. EARLY CHEMICAL AND MINERALOGICAL TRANSFORMATIONS INFLUENCED THE GEOLOGICAL EVOLUTION AFTER EVAPORATION OF AN OCEAN AND LOSS OF WATER FROM THE PLANET. SINGS OF PAST AQUEOUS PROCESSES COULD BE PRESENT IN MINERALOGY, AND CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF SURFACE MATERIALS. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND LINKS BETWEEN PUTATIVE AQUEOUS PROCESSES AND PRESENT VENUS, WE WILL INVESTIGATE CHEMISTRY AND MINERALOGY OF AQUEOUS INTERACTIONS ON THE EARLY PLANET AND EVALUATE THEIR EFFECTS ON THE SUBSEQUENT EVOLUTION. ON EARLY VENUS, CHEMICAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN OCEANIC WATER, ATMOSPHERIC GASES AND ROCKS COULD HAVE AFFECTED THE COMPOSITION ON VOLATILE-BEARING PLANETARY ENVELOPES. DISSOLUTION ATMOSPHERIC GASES AND ROCKS FORMED THE COMPOSITION AND PH OF OCEANIC WATER. ALTERATION OF ROCKS LED TO FORMATION OF SECONDARY MINERALS SUCH AS CLAYS, CARBONATES, AND OXIDES. SALTS COULD HAVE PRECIPITATED DURING WARMING AND EVAPORATION OF OCEANIC WATER. THE SPECIATION OF THE ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN-ROCK SYSTEM, MASSES OF COMPOUNDS, AND SECONDARY MINERALOGY CAN BE EVALUATED BY METHODS OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY WHICH ASSUME AT LEAST PARTIAL CHEMICAL EQUILIBRATION BETWEEN PHASES.

THE GREENHOUSE WARMING TRANSFORMED AQUEOUS MINERALS THROUGH DEHYDRATION, DECARBONATION, EVAPORATION, MELTING, AND INTERACTION WITH OTHER SPECIES. SOME MINERALS FORMED AT THE AQUEOUS STAGE COULD HAVE BEEN BURIED AND MELTED. AN OCCURRENCE OF REWORKED ANCIENT MINERALS IN THE LITHOSPHERE COULD HAVE BEEN MANIFESTED IN THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND THE REDOX STATE OF SURFACE ROCKS. ERUPTIONS OF MOLTEN SALTS COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FORMATION OF MEANDERING CHANNELS SEEN ON MAGELLAN RADAR IMAGES. WE WILL EVALUATE FATE OF AQUEOUS MINERALS AFTER CESSATION OF AN AQUEOUS STAGE OF VENUS EVOLUTION. THE COMPOSITION OF THE HYDROSPHERE-LITHOSPHERE-ATMOSPHERE SYSTEM WILL BE EVALUATED THROUGH MASS BALANCE CALCULATIONS CONSTRAINED BY DATA ON VENUS AND EARTH. THE SPECIATION AND AMOUNTS OF COMPOUNDS WILL BE EVALUATED THROUGH CALCULATIONS OF CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIA IN THE WATER-SOLID-GAS TYPE SYSTEM. THE SPECIATION WILL REFLECT MASS BALANCES, EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANTS OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS, AND TEMPERATURE-PRESSURE CONDITIONS ADOPTED FROM CLIMATE MODELS.

THE STABILITY OF HEATED SALTS AND OTHER MINERALS WILL BE EVALUATED THROUGH CALCULATIONS OF GAS-SOLID SOLID-MELT TYPE CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIA AND BY THE ANALYSIS OF PHASE DIAGRAMS. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO EARLY HISTORY OF VENUS, EFFECTS OF PUTATIVE AQUEOUS PROCESSES ON SUBSEQUENT EVOLUTION, AND THE CURRENT STAGE OF THE PLANET. THE WORK WILL HELP ENVISION SINGS OF ANCIENT AQUEOUS PROCESSES ON VENUS. RESULTS OF THIS WORK WILL HELP INTERPRET DATA FROM FURTHER MISSIONS, INCLUDING A SAMPLE RETURN MISSION. THE WORK COMPLEMENTS CLIMATE MODELING EFFORTS TO CONSTRAIN THE PREVALENCE OF ANCIENT AQUEOUS PROCESSES ON VENUS.

THIS WILL INCLUDE EVALUATING ROUTES TO REPLACE CURRENT WASTEWATER PROCESSING, VAPOR COMPRESSION DISTILLATION (VCD), WITH PERVAPORATION. PERVAPORATION IS A MEMBRANE PROCESS, WHERE THE DRIVING FORCE FOR TRANSPORT IS VAPOR PRESSURE DIFFERENCES (OFTEN CREATED VIA EITHER A VACUUM PUMP OR A SWEEPING GAS) OF THE PERMEATING SPECIES ACROSS THE MEMBRANE. PERVAPORATION IS ADVANTAGEOUS, COMPARED TO PROCESSES LIKE DISTILLATION, IN THAT IT CAN EASILY BE OPERATED AT AMBIENT TEMPERATURES. IT CAN BREAK AZEOTROPES AND LIMIT TRANSFER OF VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOCS), THUS LIMITING THE TRANSMISSION OF UNDESIRED SPECIES INTO THE PURIFIED WATER. PERVAPORATION IS CAPABLE OF HANDLING HIGHLY CONCENTRATED BRINES WHEN COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL PROCESSES, SINCE IT IS NOT LIMITED BY THE CONCENTRATION OF SOLUTES IN THE FEED.

INITIALLY MOST OF THE WORK WILL BE PERFORMED VIA 4 FOCUSED EFFORTS, EACH INVOLVING MULTIPLE INSTITUTIONS: ANGULAR MOMENTUM TRANSPORT AT THE CORE - ENVELOPE BOUNDARY OF MASSIVE MAIN SEQUENCE STARS, CONVECTION AND WAVE TRANSPORT IN THE ENVELOPES OF MASSIVE EVOLVED STARS, TESTS OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM TRANSPORT MECHANISMS THROUGH RED GIANT ASTEROSEISMOLOGY, AND THE EFFECTS OF ROTATION AND MAGNETISM ON INWARDLY PROPAGATING CARBON BURNING FLAMES. THESE FOCUSED EFFORTS WILL EVOLVE OVER THE COURSE OF THE PROJECT AND INVOLVE DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF THE PARTICIPATING INVESTIGATORS, INSTITUTIONS AND EXTERNAL COLLABORATORS. A COMBINATION OF FREQUENT SMALL WORKSHOPS, EXTENDED INTERCAMPUS VISITS, AND INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT WILL LINK THE TEAM TOGETHER. THE MAJOR PHYSICS OUTCOMES OF THIS WORK WILL BE 1D STELLAR MODELS OF SUPERNOVA PROGENITORS WHICH ARE INFORMED BY 3D PHYSICS AND TESTABLE BY OBSERVATIONS. THIS WORK WILL IMPACT COSMOLOGY THROUGH IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF SUPERNOVA-BASED PROBES, GRAVITATION RESEARCH THROUGH IMPROVED ESTIMATES OF THE BIRTH RATES AND PROPERTIES OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVE SOURCES, AND GALACTIC EVOLUTION RESEARCH THROUGH IMPROVED ESTIMATES FOR NUCLEOSYNTHETIC YIELDS AND POST MAIN SEQUENCE MASS LOSS. OTHER MAJOR OUTCOMES WILL INCLUDE ADAPTATION OF THE NETWORK''S COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR USE BY THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, EXPOSURE OF GRADUATE STUDENTS AND POSTDOCS TO AN UNUSUALLY BROAD RESEARCH EXPERIENCE, AND ADVANCES IN SUBGRID MODELING THAT MAY BE APPLICABLE TO OTHER FIELDS IN SCIENCE. INTELLECTUAL MERIT: THE TEAM WILL INTEGRATE STATE OF THE ART STELLAR COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS CODES, STELLAR PULSATION CODES, AND STELLAR STRUCTURE AND EVOLUTION CODES IN COMBINATION FOR THE FIRST TIME. INTERLEAVING COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS WITH FUNDAMENTAL THEORY, AND INFORMED BY OBSERVATIONS, THE TEAM WILL STUDY THE EFFECTS OF WAVES, MERIDIONAL CIRCULATION, AND MAGNETIC TORQUES ON ANGULAR MOMENTUM TRANSPORT, COMPOSITIONAL MIXING, AND PULSATIONS IN EVOLVED STARS. THE RESEARCH WILL CULMINATE IN PRESCRIPTIONS FOR THESE 3D PROCESSES FOR USE IN 1D STELLAR STRUCTURE AND EVOLUTION CODES. BROADER IMPACTS: SUPERNOVAE ARE EXCITING TO THE PUBLIC AND ARE A FOCAL POINT FOR TEACHING MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF SCIENCE. ALL 4 PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS HAVE WELL ESTABLISHED OUTREACH AND EDUCATION VENUES THAT WILL BE GOOD PLATFORMS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF OUTREACH ACTIVITIES BY MEMBERS OF THE SPIDER NETWORK, INCLUDING PUBLIC LECTURES AND WORKSHOPS, VISITS TO K-12 CLASSROOMS, SUMMER PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS, AND INCORPORATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS AND VISUALIZATIONS INTO BOTH UNIVERSITY GENERAL ASTRONOMY COURSES FOR NONSCIENCE MAJORS AND SPECIALIZED COURSES FOR STUDENTS IN STEM FIELDS. THE PROJECT WILL TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCIENTISTS THROUGH GRADUATE STUDENT AND POSTDOC PARTICIPATION IN EVERY PHASE OF THE NETWORK."

AFTER ALL, SPACE MAY BE OUR FINAL FRONTIER BUT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY BEFORE, AND WE CAN DRAW INSPIRATION FROM THE CREATIVE FINANCIAL STRUCTURES THAT MADE POSSIBLE THE EXPLORATION OF THE EARTHS OCEANS, POLAR REGIONS, AND OTHER TERRA INCOGNITA. WE PROPOSE A COLLABORATION BETWEEN THREE RESEARCH CENTERS AT ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY: THE CENTER FOR SCIENCE AND THE IMAGINATION (CSI), THE CONSORTIUM FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY OUTCOMES (CSPO), AND THE SPACE TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE (NEWSPACE) INITIATIVE WHERE WE BRING TOGETHER ECONOMIC HISTORIANS, SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, AND SCIENCE FICTION AUTHORS TO CREATE TECHNICALLY GROUNDED, COMPELLING VISIONS OF NEAR-FUTURE SPACE EXPLORATION THROUGH THE PROJECT HIEROGLYPH PROCESS. PROJECT HIEROGLYPH, DESCRIBED IN GREATER DETAIL BELOW, WAS FOUNDED BY NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHOR NEAL STEPHENSON AND AIMS TO REKINDLE OUR GRAND AMBITIONS FOR THE FUTURE THROUGH THE POWER OF STORYTELLING. HIEROGLYPH BRINGS TOGETHER TOP SCIENCE FICTION AUTHORS WITH DOMAIN AREA EXPERTS TO COLLABORATE ON AMBITIOUS, TECHNO-OPTIMISTIC VISIONS OF THE NEAR FUTURE. WE BELIEVE THIS PROCESS CAN BE USED TO INSPIRE BOLD THINKING AND CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO ECONOMIC RESEARCH ON THE EMERGING SPACE ECOSYSTEM. SPECIFICALLY, WE SEE INSPIRATION, VISION, AND CREATIVITY ORIGINATING FROM THREE SOURCES: HISTORY, SCIENCE FICTION, AND INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAMS."

THESE IMAGES WERE LATER REDUCED INTO A GLOBAL MULTISPECTRAL MOSAIC AND A SERIES OF MINERALOGY AND MATURITY MAPS [3 AND REFERENCES THEREIN], WHICH WERE USED IN NUMEROUS STUDIES TO ADVANCE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE LUNAR SURFACE. AFTER THE MISSION, TWO EFFORTS WERE MADE TO IMPROVE THE GEODETIC ACCURACY OF AVAILABLE CARTOGRAPHIC PRODUCTS: CLEMENTINE LUNAR CONTROL NETWORK (CLCN) [4] AND THE UNIFIED LUNAR CONTROL NETWORK (ULCN) 2005 [5]. WITH THE SUCCESS OF THE GRAVITY RECOVERY AND INTERIOR LABORATORY (GRAIL) MISSION AND THE LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (LRO) OUR KNOWLEDGE OF LUNAR GRAVITY, TOPOGRAPHY, AND THE LOCATION OF FEATURES ON THE SURFACE HAS IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY (ELEVATIONS WITHIN 20 M AND GEODETIC ACCURACY<45 M WITHOUT GROUND CONTROL POINTS) [6,7]. USING NEW IMAGE DATASETS PROVIDED BY LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER CAMERA (LROC) AND EPHEMERIS DERIVED FROM LUNAR ORBITER LASER ALTIMETER (LOLA) [8] AND GRAIL DATA [9,10], WE PROPOSE IMPROVING THE GEODETIC ACCURACY OF THE CLEMENTINE IMAGES TO THE REFERENCE FRAME DEVELOPED BY THE LRO MISSION. METHODOLOGY: OUR APPROACH COMBINES IMAGE REGISTRATION AND MODELING THE ORIENTATION PARAMETERS FOR EACH CLEMENTINE IMAGE. WHEREAS PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON A SINGLE BAND (750 NM) AND RELIED ON REGISTERING ONLY OVERLAPPING REGIONS, EACH UVVIS IMAGE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY REGISTERED TO A LROC WIDE ANGLE CAMERA (WAC) IMAGE ACQUIRED UNDER SIMILAR ILLUMINATION. THIS APPROACH WILL INCREASE THE ABSOLUTE GEODETIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE CLEMENTINE IMAGES FROM 1-2 KM TO<100 M AND THE RELATIVE REGISTRATION TO BETTER THAN 0.25 OF A PIXEL. ONCE IMAGE REGISTRATION AND MODELING OF THE ORIENTATION PARAMETERS IS COMPLETE, NEW SPICE KERNELS WILL BE CREATED AND ARCHIVED (NAIF) ENABLING RESEARCHERS TO ANALYZE THE ORIGINAL CLEMENTINE UVVIS IMAGES IN THE NEW LRO REFERENCE FRAME FOR COMPARATIVE STUDIES NOT ONLY WITH LRO IMAGES BUT ALSO WITH DATASETS USING THE LRO REFERENCE FRAME. IN ADDITION, OUR TEAM WILL PRODUCE A NEW 5-BAND MAP CLEMENTINE MULTISPECTRAL CUBE (SPECTRAL BANDPASSES = 415, 750, 900, 950, 1000 NM) THAT WILL GEOMETRICALLY MATCH THE 7-BAND WAC MULTISPECTRAL CUBE (SPECTRAL BANDPASSES = 321, 360, 415, 566, 604, 643, AND 689 NM) [11] WITH IDENTICAL PHOTOMETRIC NORMALIZATION. RELEVANCE: IN RESPONSE TO THE PDART REQUEST FOR ARCHIVING OF HIGHER-ORDER DATA PRODUCTS, OUR TEAM WILL PRODUCE TWO NEW PRODUCTS TO ENABLE JOINT STUDIES BETWEEN UVVIS IMAGES AND LRO DATASETS: 1) UPDATED ORIENTATION INFORMATION FOR EACH CLEMENTINE UVVIS IMAGE; 2) A 5-BAND CLEMENTINE UVVIS AND CORRESPONDING 7-BAND LROC WAC MAP OF THE LUNAR SURFACE FOR MULTISPECTRAL STUDIES.

WE HAVE LED SEVERAL LARGE GRISM PROGRAMS, AND DEVELOPED SOFTWARE FOR BOTH SIMULATING AND ANALYSING SLITLESS GRISM DATA (AXE AND AXESIM). WE HAVE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO DESIGN AND PLANNING OF JDEM/WFIRST MISSIONS AND WHITE PAPERS. WE WILL ADAPT OUR SOFTWARE TO WFIRST, AND USE IT FOR END-TO-END SIMULATIONS OF THE WFIRST SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY, TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED PROPERTIES OF THE WFIRST EMISSION LINE GALAXY SAMPLES. WE WILL SUMMARIZE OUR RESULTS IN THREE WHITE PAPERS, ON (1) THOSE PROPERTIES OF EMISSION LINE GALAXY POPULATIONS MOST CRUCIAL TO WFIRST PLANNING; (2) THE PROSPECTS FOR REIONIZATION TESTS USING WFIRST-AFTA; AND (3) THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF CHANGES TO EITHER INSTRUMENTAL PARAMTERS OR OBSERVING STRATEGY ON THE RESULTING EMISSION LINE GALAXY SAMPLES."""

THE DISSOCIATION PROBABILITIES FOR XSO2 FROM HIGH RESOLUTION LINEWIDTH MEASUREMENTS  3.THE RATES OF COLLISIONAL AND RADIATIVE DEACTIVATION OF EXCITED STATE XSO2 USING FLUORESCENCE AND PHOSPHORESCENCE MEASUREMENTS 4. THE ABSORPTION CROSS SECTIONS OF XSO 5. THE ABSORPTION CROSS SECTIONS FOR THE SULFUR SOTOPOLOGUES OF CS2; AND THE ABSORPTION CROSS SECTIONS FOR S2. QUANTUM MECHANICAL MODELING, INFORMED BY THE MEASURED CROSS SECTIONS, WILL BE USED TO COMPUTE CROSS SECTIONS FOR ALL RELEVANT SO AND S2 SULFUR ISOTOPOLOGUES. THE RESULTS OF THESE MEASURED AND COMPUTED CROSS SECTIONS, AND OF THE INTERSYSTEM CROSSING RATES FOR PHOTOEXCITED SO2, WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO PHOTOCHEMICAL MODEL SIMULATIONS OF SULFUR ISOTOPES IN THE ARCHEAN ATMOSPHERE.

THE PRIMARY CONCEPT IS THE REALIZATION OF A HIGH TEMPERATURE, HIGH EFFICIENCY TANDEM SOLAR CELL DEVICE BASED ON INGAN MATERIALS. AS IS WELL KNOWN, THE INXGA1XN TERNARY COMPOUND SYSTEM HAS A RANGE OF BANDGAPS BASED ON THE MOLE FRACTION, X, OF IN THAT SPANS THE ENTIRE SOLAR SPECTRUM. FURTHERMORE, NITRIDE BASED ELECTRONICS AND OPTOELECTRONICS ARE DEMONSTRATED TO OPERATE AT HIGH TEMPERATURES  400 C AND ARE THE BASIS FOR HIGH POWER, HIGH TEMPERATURE ELECTRONICS. THEY ALSO SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR A RAPIDLY GROWING WHITE LIGHT EMITTING DIODE LED MARKET, WITH WELL ESTABLISHED ROADMAPS FOR COST REDUCTION AND MANUFACTURABILITY. THE FOLLOWING KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PROPOSED SOLAR CELL ALLOW HIGH EFFICIENCY AND HIGH TEMPERATURE OPERATION.   A TWO JUNCTION INGAN BASED TANDEM SOLAR CELL STRUCTURE TO EXCEED THE NASA TARGET SOLAR CELL EFFICIENCY GOALS  25 OPERATING AT OR NEAR THE OPERATING TEMPERATURE OF THE SOLAR THERMAL SYSTEM.  ADVANCED DEVICE STRUCTURES AND FABRICATION METHODS SUITABLE FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE OPERATION SUCH AS HIGH THERMAL STABILITY METAL CONTACT METALLURGY WITH LOW SPECIFIC CONTACT RESISTANCE AND ALL NITRIDE BASED SEMICONDUCTOR COMPONENTS.  NOVEL HETEROSTRUCTURE CARRIER SELECTIVE CONTACT STRUCTURES IN THE ABSORBER LAYER TO INCREASE OPEN CIRCUIT VOLTAGE AND RELAX THE DOPING REQUIREMENTS IN THE PHOTOACTIVE REGIONS.  THERMIONIC ESCAPE FROM  SHALLOW  QUANTUM WELLS QWS THAT ACHIEVES HIGH EFFICIENCY THROUGH INCREASED PHOTOCARRIER COLLECTION AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES.  A FLEXIBLE DEVICE TECHNOLOGY TO ALLOW FOR CONFORMAL MOUNTING OF THE SOLAR CELL DEVICE TO THE TARGET SOLAR THERMAL TECHNOLOGY, AND REDUCE SUBSTRATE AND RELATED MATERIAL COSTS.  ADVANTAGES THE PROPOSED III NITRIDE SOLAR CELL HAS NUMEROUS ADVANTAGES IF INTEGRATING INTO A CONCENTRATED SOLAR POWER CSP SYSTEM, RELATING TO ITS PERFORMANCE, COST, SCALABILITY AND FEASIBILITY. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROPOSED INGAN SOLAR CELL ALLOWS A SYSTEM WITH HIGHER EFFICIENCY AND LOWER COSTS THAN ANY OTHER SOLAR BASED ELECTRICITY SYSTEM, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ALLOWING A LARGE FRACTION OF DISPATCHABLE ELECTRICITY, THUS ADDRESSING THE MAJOR PRESENT DRAWBACK WITH PV SYSTEMS. FURTHERMORE, THROUGH THE EXISTING LED INDUSTRY, THE DEVICES HAVE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED RELIABILITY AND SCALABILITY. FINALLY, THE ABILITY TO MAKE HIGH PERFORMANCE HIGHER BANDGAP INGAN SOLAR CELLS HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED. THESE ADVANTAGES ARE SUMMARIZED IN  TABLE I OF THE FULL PROPOSAL.  IMPACTS AND INFUSION THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGH EFFICIENCY INGAN SOLAR CELL ENABLES A TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE IN THE ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY GENERATE POWER WITHOUT CONCERNS OF OPERATIONAL TEMPERATURES, WHICH IS A KEY REQUIREMENT FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS. THE KEY ASPECTS OF THE APPROACH ARE TO CAPITALIZE ON THE UNIQUE PROPERTIES OF THE III NITRIDE MATERIALS SYSTEMS, WHICH EXCLUSIVELY AMONG COMMERCIAL SEMICONDUCTORS ALLOW HIGH TEMPERATURE OPERATION. FURTHER, WE CAPITALIZE ON THE RAPID GROWTH INDUSTRIES BASED ON THE III NITRIDES SUCH AS SOLID STATE LIGHTING, WHICH DRIVES BOTH TECHNICAL INNOVATION AND REDUCED COSTS. A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF THE RESEARCH WILL BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO VARIOUS NASA MISSIONS AS POWER GENERATION IS CRITICAL TO SPACE TECHNOLOGY, ESPECIALLY FOR SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE SMD MISSIONS FOCUSED ON DESTINATIONS CLOSER TO THE SUN. OTHER IMPACT INCLUDES ENABLES A TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE IN THE ABILITY TO INTEGRATE RENEWABLE ENERGY INTO THE ELECTRICITY GRID."

IT IS A WORLD WHERE TIDES ARE THE DOMINANT PROCESS, CONTROLLING BOTH SURFACE MODIFICATION AND INTERIOR STRUCTURE. WE NOW KNOW THAT EUROPA IS NOT UNIQUE; TINY, ICE-COVERED ENCELADUS DISPLAYS TECTONIC ACTIVITY, PLUME ERUPTIONS, AND HIGH HEAT FLOW THAT ARE ALL LIKELY GOVERNED BY TIDES. STUDYING TIDAL-TECTONIC PROCESSES ON EUROPA PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR INTERPRETING SURFACES OF ALL BODIES IN WHICH TIDES PLAY A ROLE. HOWEVER, FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THESE TECHNIQUES IS REQUIRED TO FULLY UNDERSTAND TIDAL-TECTONIC PROCESSES AND INTERPRET THE DYNAMICAL, TIDAL, AND INTERIOR EVOLUTION RECORDED ON EUROPA''S SURFACE. TECTONIC ACTIVITY ON EUROPA HAS BEEN LINKED TO TIDAL STRESS CAUSED BY ITS ECCENTRIC ORBIT, FINITE OBLIQUITY, AND POSSIBLY NON-SYNCHRONOUS ROTATION OF THE ICY SHELL. CYCLOIDS AND OTHER LINEAMENTS ARE THOUGHT TO FORM IN RESPONSE TO TIDAL NORMAL STRESS WHILE STRIKE-SLIP MOTION ALONG PREEXISTING FAULTS HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO TIDAL SHEAR STRESS. TECTONIC FEATURES CAN THUS PROVIDE CONSTRAINTS ON THE ROTATIONAL PARAMETERS THAT GOVERN TIDAL STRESS AND INSIGHT INTO THE TIDAL-TECTONIC PROCESSES OPERATING ON ICE-COVERED OCEAN BODIES. TIDAL-TECTONIC FORMATION MODELS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT FITTING LARGE-SCALE TRENDS IN THE POPULATIONS OF CYCLOIDS, STRIKE-SLIP FAULTS, AND LINEAMENTS, AS WELL AS REPRODUCING THE PATHS OF INDIVIDUAL CYCLOIDS. HOWEVER, SIMPLIFICATIONS IN THE TIDAL STRESS CALCULATIONS AND IN THE ROLE OF EUROPA''S INTERIOR STRUCTURE HAVE LED TO LIMITATIONS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY EXPLORED. IN PAST TIDAL-TECTONIC MODELING EFFORTS, EUROPA''S ICE SHELL HAS BEEN TREATED AS UNIFORM AND ELASTIC, OVERLYING A GLOBAL OCEAN. HOWEVER, THE DEPTH-DEPENDENT VISCOELASTIC NATURE OF ICE SHELLS WILL AFFECT LONG-TERM SOURCES OF STRESS, INCLUDING NON-SYNCHRONOUS ROTATION. IN FACT, VISCOUS RELAXATION HAS EVEN BEEN SHOWN TO CAUSE A PHASE LAG IN DIURNAL TIDAL STRESS. THE EFFECT OF THESE CHANGES ON FRACTURE FORMATION HAS YET TO BE INVESTIGATED. IN ADDITION, IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT EUROPA''S GEOLOGIC ACTIVITY HAS CHANGED OVER TIME. ONE THEORY IS THAT EUROPA''S FRACTURES ARE OLDER, HAVING FORMED WHEN THE ICE WAS RELATIVELY THIN, WHEREAS CHAOS FEATURES ARE YOUNGER AND FORMED THROUGH CONVECTION IN A THICKER SHELL. SIMILARLY, LINEAMENTS AND CYCLOIDS ARE BOTH THOUGHT TO BE TIDALLY-DRIVEN TENSILE FRACTURES, AND YET, DISPLAY VERY DIFFERENT MORPHOLOGIES. IT HAS BEEN PROPOSED THAT CYCLOIDS FORMED AT A TIME WHEN DIURNAL STRESSES DOMINATED WHEREAS LINEAMENTS FORMED WHEN NON-SYNCHRONOUS ROTATION (NSR) STRESSES DOMINATED. EVEN FOR THE SAME ROTATION PERIOD, THE STRESSES INDUCED BY NSR CAN CHANGE DRAMATICALLY BASED ON THE RHEOLOGY OF THE ICE SHELL. VARIATIONS IN ECCENTRICITY OR OBLIQUITY COULD AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF HEAT DISSIPATED WITHIN EUROPA; CHANGES IN HEAT COULD ALTER THE VISCOSITY OF THE ICE SHELL, PERHAPS DRIVING DIFFERENT TYPES OF GEOLOGIC ACTIVITY ON EUROPA. WE PROPOSE TO INCORPORATE RHEOLOGY-DEPENDENT TIDAL STRESS EQUATIONS INTO EXISTING TIDAL-TECTONIC MODELS AND TEST OUR MODEL PREDICTIONS AGAINST OBSERVED CYCLOIDS, LINEAMENTS, AND STRIKE-SLIP FAULTS.WE WILL THEN ASSESS THE ROLE OF NONSYNCHRONOUS ROTATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF TIDAL-TECTONIC FEATURES AND TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE RHEOLOGY OF EUROPA''S ICE SHELL HAS CHANGED WITH TIME."

WE PROPOSE A HYBRID EULERIAN/LAGRANGIAN APPROACH THAT COMBINES A EULERIAN VOLUME OF FLUID INTERFACE CAPTURING APPROACH IN THE PRIMARY ATOMIZATION REGION WITH A LAGRANGIAN APPROACH IN THE SECONDARY ATOMIZATION REGION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS A MODEL FREE OF ADJUSTABLE TUNING PARAMETERS. TO THAT END, A NOVEL DUAL SCALE LES APPROACH IS PROPOSED TO PREDICT THE PRIMARY ATOMIZATION PROCESS CLOSE TO THE FUEL INJECTOR. INSTEAD OF RELYING ON THE TRADITIONAL LES MODELING PARADIGM THAT DYNAMICS ON THE UNRESOLVED SUB-FILTER SCALE FOLLOW A CERTAIN UNIVERSALITY AND CAN BE INFERRED SOLELY FROM THE DYNAMICS ON THE RESOLVED SCALES, THE DUAL SCALE APPROACH AIMS TO MAINTAIN A REPRESENTATIVE FULLY RESOLVED REALIZATION OF THE LIQUID/GAS PHASE INTERFACE GEOMETRY. THIS NOT ONLY PROVIDES DIRECT CLOSURE MODELS FOR THE FILTERED TERMS IN THE NAVIER-STOKES EQUATION BUT ALSO, MORE IMPORTANTLY, ALLOWS FOR DIRECT CAPTURING OF THE SMALL SCALE PHASE INTERFACE DYNAMICS DURING BREAKUP, AVOIDING ANY PHENOMENOLOGICAL AD-HOC MODELS FOR THE PRIMARY ATOMIZATION PROCESS ON THE SUB-FILTER SCALE OR THE QUESTIONABLE ASSUMPTION OF UNIVERSALITY OF THE PHASE INTERFACE DYNAMICS ON THE SUBFILTER SCALE. INSTEAD, BROKEN-OFF INDIVIDUAL LIQUID STRUCTURES AND DROPS/BLOBS WITH THEIR POSITION, MOMENTUM, AND MASS ARE THE OUTCOME OF THE LES MODEL FOR THE PRIMARY ATOMIZATION PROCESS AND ARE INTERACTIVELY COUPLED TO A LAGRANGIAN SPRAY MODEL USING A NOVEL SHAPE AWARE PARALLEL DROP TRANSFER ALGORITHM.  THESE LIQUID DROPS (BLOBS) NEED FURTHER ACCURATE MODELING OF THE DROP DYNAMICS AT THE SUBGRID SCALE LEVEL. A LAGRANGIAN APPROACH HERE IS ADVANTAGEOUS AS IT ALLOWS FOR EXPLICIT MODELING OF VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE DROP DYNAMICS IMPORTANT FOR SECONDARY ATOMIZATION AND DROPLET DISPERSION. A TWO-PARAMETER STOCHASTIC BREAKUP MODEL WILL BE EMPLOYED FOR SECONDARY ATOMIZATION AT LARGE REYNOLDS AND WEBER NUMBERS REPRESENTATIVE OF REALISTIC AIRCRAFT FUEL INJECTORS. IN ADDITION, NEAR THE INJECTOR, IN THE DENSE SPRAY REGIME, THE DROPLET-DROPLET INTERACTIONS, DROPLET DEFORMATION AND INTERNAL CIRCULATION EFFECTS ON THE DRAG AND LIFT FORCES CAN BE IMPORTANT. IT IS THUS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE UPON THE STANDARD POINT-PARTICLE, TWO-WAY COUPLING BASED SUBGRID SCALE MODELS FOR SPRAY DYNAMICS. ACCOUNTING FOR THE FLUID MASS DISPLACED BY THE DROPLETS IS IMPORTANT AND REQUIRES REFORMULATION OF THE EULERIAN FLUID PHASE GOVERNING EQUATIONS TO INCLUDE CARRIER PHASE VOLUME FRACTION VARIATIONS.  TO MAKE THE DEVELOPED MODELS APPLICABLE TO REALISTIC AIRCRAFT INJECTOR GEOMETRIES A FULLY UNSTRUCTURED FLOW SOLVER WILL BE USED THAT HAS PROVEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE PAST IN SIMULATING THE FLOW IN AIRCRAFT ENGINES. THE TO BE DEVELOPED MODELS WILL BE VERIFIED USING A HIERARCHY OF DIRECT NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF EVER MORE COMPLEX ATOMIZING FLOWS, CULMINATING IN THE SIMULATION OF A REALISTIC HIGH SHEAR FUEL INJECTION NOZZLE GEOMETRY PROPOSED BY UNITED TECHNOLOGIES RESEARCH CENTER CONSISTING OF SIX LIQUID JETS INJECTING INTO A SWIRLING INNER CROSSFLOW AND FURTHER ATOMIZING WITH AN OUTER SWIRLING AIRFLOW.

ALTHOUGH THE ASTEROID BELT IS THE MAIN SOURCE OF IMPACTORS IN THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM TODAY, IT CONTAINS ONLY 0.05 LUNAR MASSES OF MATERIAL. WHILE THE ASTEROID BELT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE MASSIVE WHEN IT FORMED, IT IS UNLIKELY TO HAVE HAD GREATER THAN A LUNAR MASS SINCE THE FORMATION OF JUPITER AND THE DISSIPATION OF THE SOLAR NEBULA. BY COMPARISON, GIANT IMPACTS ONTO THE TERRESTRIAL PLANETS DURING THE LATE STAGE OF ACCRETION TYPICALLY RELEASED DEBRIS EQUAL TO SEVERAL PER CENT OF THE PLANET''S MASS INTO HELIOCENTRIC ORBIT. THE MOON-FORMING IMPACT ON EARTH, FOR EXAMPLE, RELEASED OVER A LUNAR MASS OF DEBRIS, MORE THAN HAS EVER BEEN CONTAINED IN THE ASTEROID BELT. THE BOREALIS BASIN IMPACT ON MARS RELEASED MORE DEBRIS AT ONCE, THAN THE PRESENT DAY ASTEROID BELT. ESCAPING IMPACT DEBRIS IS LESS LONG LIVED THAN THE MAIN ASTEROID BELT, AS IT IS INJECTED ON UNSTABLE, PLANET-CROSSING ORBITS. THIS SAME FACTOR HOWEVER ALSO INCREASES THE IMPACT PROBABILITY WITH THE TERRESTRIAL PLANETS AND ASTEROIDS. WITH SUCH A LARGE AMOUNT OF MASS IT SEEMS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT THESE NOW-EXTINCT POPULATIONS OF IMPACTORS SHOULD HAVE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM, MUCH AS NOW-EXTINCT RADIONUCLIDES PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE THERMAL HISTORIES OF SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES. ONE OF THE MOST OBVIOUS EFFECTS OF RE-IMPACTING DEBRIS IS THE PRODUCTION OF CRATERS. THE MOON, MARS, MERCURY AND THE LARGEST ASTEROIDS MAY BE EXPECTED TO DISPLAY EVIDENCE OF RE-IMPACTING BOMBARDMENTS IN THEIR CRATER RECORD, SUBJECT TO THEIR THERMAL STATE AND SUBSEQUENT SURFACE RE-PROCESSING. HOWEVER, IN UNDERSTANDING THE CRATERING HISTORY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM, THE CONTRIBUTION OF GIANT IMPACT DEBRIS HAS BEEN ALMOST UNIVERSALLY NEGLECTED, AND CONSTRAINING THIS CONTRIBUTION CONSTITUTES OUR PRIMARY TASK. IN ADDITION TO THE PRODUCTION OF SURFACE CRATERS, LARGE IMPACTS CAN PUNCH THROUGH THE LITHOSPHERE AND EXHUME MATERIAL FROM LARGE DEPTHS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY PERTINENT FOR RE-IMPACTS ONTO A PROGENITOR BODY WHICH WILL HAVE A DEEP MAGMA OCEAN AFTER THE GIANT IMPACT. DEPENDING ON THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF THE TARGET, THIS MAGMA OCEAN MAY FORM A FLOTATION CRUST AS ON THE MOON AND PERHAPS MERCURY, THAT WOULD ACT AS AN INSULATING BLANKET. IMPACTORS THAT PUNCH THROUGH OR DISRUPT THIS CRUST MAY ALLOW THE MAGMA OCEAN TO COOL FASTER. CONVERSELY, FOR MAGMA OCEANS THAT FREEZE FROM THE BOTTOM UP, THE ENERGY INPUT FROM RE-IMPACTS MAY KEEP THEM LIQUID FOR LONGER. THIS FEEDS BACK INTO THE CRATERING RECORD AS CRATERS WILL ONLY BE RECORDED ONCE THERE IS A STABLE, SOLID SURFACE. IN THIS SENSE THE DYNAMICS OF GIANT IMPACT DEBRIS CAN IN PRINCIPLE BECOME A CHRONOMETER OF PLANETARY SOLIDIFICATION. THE INFLUENCE OF LONG TERM RE-ACCUMULATION ON PLANETARY THERMAL EVOLUTION IS OUR SECOND TASK. OUR THIRD TASK IS TO STUDY RE-IMPACTING DEBRIS AS AN ASPECT OF TERRESTRIAL SATELLITE FORMATION. THE MOON, PHOBOS AND DEIMOS LIKELY FORMED FROM CIRCUMPLANETARY DEBRIS DISKS. THESE DISKS DID NOT EXIST IN ISOLATION. THEY, AND THE SATELLITES THAT FORM FROM THEM, WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO RE-IMPACTS BY RETURNING DEBRIS FROM THEIR FORMATIVE GIANT IMPACTS. WHETHER SUCH DISK IMPACTS WOULD HAVE AIDED OR HINDERED SATELLITE FORMATION IS UNCLEAR."

THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF SUCH FRACTURES WILL ENABLE US ACHIEVE OUR ADDITIONAL OBJECTIVES: TO IDENTIFY THE INTERIOR STRUCTURE AND ECCENTRICITY THAT BEST REPRODUCE THE GEOLOGIC FEATURES ON EACH OF THE MOONS AND DETERMINE WHETHER OCEANS WERE PRESENT ON THESE MOONS WITHIN THEIR SURFACE AGES. TO COMPLETE THESE OBJECTIVES, OUR FIRST TASK WILL BE MAPPING FRACTURES ON DIONE AND RHEA AND MEASURING THEIR ORIENTATIONS USING CASSINI ISS IMAGES. THEN, AS OUR SECOND TASK, WE WILL COMPUTE TIDAL STRESSES IN RHEOLOGICALLYLAYERED BODIES FOR A VARIETY OF ORBITAL-INTERIOR MODELS, INFORMED BY FORMATION MODELS. WE WILL INCLUDE INTERIOR STRUCTURES WITH AND WITHOUT OCEANS TO TEST THE INFERENCE OF OCEANS ON DIONE AND RHEA FROM CRATER RELAXATION AND FLEXURE MODELS AND TO CONSTRAIN THE EXTENT OF TIDAL ACTIVITY THAT CAN BE EXPECTED IN OCEAN-FREE SATELLITES. WE WILL ALSO TEST THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER ECCENTRICITIES IN ORDER TO CONSTRAIN ORBITAL EVOLUTION MODELS OF THE SATURNIAN SYSTEM THAT INVOKE SUCH SCENARIOS. OUR THIRD TASK WILL BE A STATISTICAL COMPARISON BETWEEN THE FRACTURE PATTERNS PREDICTED BY OUR TIDAL MODELS AND THE OBSERVED TECTONIC RECORDS OF DIONE AND RHEA. WE WILL USE THE OBSERVED FRACTURE ORIENTATIONS, GLOBAL PATTERN OF FRACTURING, AND TIDAL STRESS MAGNITUDES TO IDENTIFY THE MOST LIKELY ORBITAL-INTERIOR MODEL(S) FOR EACH MOON. FINALLY, WE WILL COMPARE RESULTS FOR BOTH MOONS, AS WELL AS PUBLISHED MODELS OF ENCELADUS AND MIMAS, TO DETERMINE THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE(S) OF THEIR VARYING SURFACE HISTORIES. THE POWER OF THE TIDAL-TECTONIC MODELING APPROACH, DEVELOPED BY OUR PROPOSAL TEAM, HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED AT EUROPA FOR SEVERAL TYPES OF TECTONIC FEATURES. IN RECENT YEARS, OUR TEAM HAS ADAPTED THESE METHODS TO ADDRESS VISCOELASTIC RHEOLOGIES AND VALIDATED OUR NUMERICAL TOOLS AGAINST RESULTS PUBLISHED FOR EUROPA. WE HAVE SINCE USED THESE TOOLS TO CONDUCT TIDAL-TECTONIC ANALYSES OF PLUTOS MOON, CHARON, AND SATURNS MOON, MIMAS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR PROPOSED WORK RELIES ON THESE PUBLISHED AND VALIDATED METHODS. OUR PROPOSED WORK WILL CHARACTERIZE THE TECTONIC ACTIVITY OF SATURNS MID-SIZED ICY MOONS, CONSTRAIN THE RHEOLOGY AND ORBITAL HISTORIES OF DIONE AND RHEA, AND ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF PAST LIQUID WATER OCEANS WITHIN THESE MOONS. HENCE, THIS WORK HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ORBITAL EVOLUTION OF THE ENTIRE SATURNIAN SYSTEM AND THE EXTENT OF HABITABLE ENVIRONMENTS IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM. CASSINI DATA IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THIS WORK AND WILL, THEREFORE, ENHANCE THE SCIENTIFIC RETURN OF THE CASSINI MISSION BY BROADENING THE SCIENTIFIC PARTICIPATION IN THE ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF THE DATA RETURNED BY THE MISSION""."""

IT IS PRESENTLY NOT KNOWN WHETHER THE EVOLUTION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS WAS A FLUKE OF BIOCHEMISTRY OR WHETHER IT WAS ENABLED BY GEOCHEMICAL CHANGES THAT PRECEDED ITS EMERGENCE. THE INTACT GEOLOGIC RECORD IN ANCIENT ROCKS MAY EXTEND BACK TO TIMES WHEN THERE WAS NO PHOTOSYNTHESIS ON EARTH, BUT RESEARCHERS DO NOT YET KNOW WHAT EVIDENCE TO SEEK TO PIN DOWN THE HISTORICAL RECORD OF WHEN AND HOW PHOTOSYNTHESIS BEGAN.

THE ROLE OF MICROBES IN MEDIATING THE PRECIPITATION OF HYDROTHERMAL SILICA DEPOSITS IS STILL A DEVELOPING AREA OF STUDY. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO EVALUATE THE ROLE OF MICROBES IN SILICEOUS HOT SPRING DEPOSITS FOUND AT THE EL TATIO GEOTHERMAL FIELD IN THE ATACAMA DESERT OF NORTHERN CHILE. THIS LOCATION, AT AN ELEVATION OF 4300 M, IS UNIQUE IN HAVING SALINE SPRINGS THAT PRECIPITATE MICRO-DIGITATE FORMS COMPOSED OF OPALINE SILICA ENCRUSTED IN HALITE, MINERALS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO CAPTURE AND PRESERVE A MICROBIAL FOSSIL RECORD. MOST IMPORTANTLY IN THE PRESENT CONTEXT, THESE DEPOSITS PROVIDE THE BEST-KNOWN MORPHOLOGIC AND SPECTRAL ANALOG FOR THE OPALINE SILICA OUTCROPS DISCOVERED WITH THE SPIRIT ROVER AT HOME PLATE IN GUSEV CRATER. OUR GOAL IS TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL BIOGENICITY AND PRESERVATION POTENTIAL OF THE MICRO-DIGITATE SILICA STRUCTURES SEEN IN OUTCROPS AT HOME PLATE USING DETAILED CHARACTERIZATION AND COMPARISONS TO THE STRUCTURES AT EL TATIO. METHODS/TECHNIQUES WE WILL CONDUCT FIELDWORK AT EL TATIO AND AT A SECOND SITE IN PERU (CALIENTES) INTENDED TO CHARACTERIZE THE DIVERSITY AND FORMATION CONDITIONS OF THE MICRO-DIGITATE SILICA STRUCTURES AND EXPAND OUR SAMPLE SUITE.

HARDWARE COMPONENTS, SUCH AS BATTERIES, TRANSMITTERS, ETC. WILL ONLY OPERATE WITHIN A COMPARATIVELY SMALLER RANGE OF TEMPERATURES. THEREFORE A THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (TMS) MUST BE DEVELOPED TO MAINTAIN THE SPACECRAFT''S TEMPERATURE AT AN OPERABLE LEVEL THROUGHOUT THE MISSION. ONE FUNCTION OF THE TMS IS TO REGULATE THE SPACECRAFT''S RADIATIVE HEAT TRANSFER WITH THE ENVIRONMENT. PASSIVE RADIATION COATINGS ARE A DESIRABLE WAY TO ACHIEVE THIS SINCE THEY REQUIRE NO ELECTRICAL INPUT AND TYPICALLY ADD A NEGLIGIBLE AMOUNT OF MASS. THIS PROPOSAL DISCUSSES WAVELENGTH-SELECTIVE, TEMPERATURE-MODULATED MULTILAYER COATINGS WHICH CAN BE USED TO CONTROL THE RADIATIVE HEAT TRANSFER BETWEEN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE SPACECRAFT. IF THE SPACECRAFT''S TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH, THE RADIATION COATING CAN HELP TO REDUCE THE TEMPERATURE THROUGH ENHANCED THERMAL EMISSION BY SELECTIVELY EMITTING IN THE MID-INFRARED. CONVERSELY, IF THE SPACECRAFT TEMPERATURE IS TOO LOW, A HIGHLY REFLECTIVE RADIATION COATING CAN PREVENT FURTHER TEMPERATURE DECREASE BY MINIMIZING THERMAL LOSS. THE PROPOSED COATINGS WILL COMBINE BOTH FUNCTIONALITIES TO PROVIDE TEMPERATURE-MODULATED VARIABLE EMISSIVITY AND IMPROVED THERMAL CONTROL. THE TEMPERATURE-MODULATED PROPERTIES ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE INCORPORATION OF A THERMOCHROMIC TRANSITION MATERIAL, VANADIUM DIOXIDE. CURRENTLY A FABRY-PEROT RESONANCE CAVITY PROVIDES THE WAVELENGTH-SELECTIVITY OF THE DESIGN, HOWEVER OTHER STRUCTURES SUCH AS NANOPARTICLE LAYERS, GRATINGS, AND NANOPILLARS, WILL BE INVESTIGATED.

FOR PHASE II OF THE PROPOSED WORK, WE WILL PERFORM SIMILARLY DETAILED MEASUREMENTS OF D H RATIOS, WATER ABUNDANCES, FE FE, AS WELL AS TRACE AND MINOR ELEMENT ABUNDANCES IN MINERALS FROM SELECTED MARTIAN METEORITES, APPLYING THE RESULTS OF ANALYSES OF THE TERRESTRIAL ANALOG SAMPLES TO SELECT ANALYTICAL APPROACHES THAT WILL MAXIMIZE THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLES OF HYDROGEN LOSS AND FRACTIONAL CRYSTALLIZATION IN CAUSING VARIATIONS IN D H RATIOS AND REDOX CONDITIONS. SPECIFICALLY, USING SIMS NANOSIMS AND SYNCHROTRON MICROXANES IN TANDEM, WE WILL SEARCH FOR CORRELATED VARIATIONS IN D H RATIOS, H2O CONTENTS, AND FE FE IN CHEMICALLY ZONED PYROXENES, AS WELL AS IN MAGMATIC MELT INCLUSIONS INCLUDING IN DAUGHTER AMPHIBOLES IN SOME OF THESE INCLUSIONS THAT MAY INDICATE EFFECTS OF HYDROGEN LOSS AND FRACTIONAL CRYSTALLIZATION. THESE INVESTIGATIONS WILL ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ORIGIN OF REDOX HETEROGENEITY WITHIN AND AMONG THE MARTIAN METEORITES AND FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE VARIABILITY OF D H IN HYDROUS AND NOMINALLY ANHYDROUS PHASES IN THESE SAMPLES. ULTIMATELY, THE RESULTS OF THE PROPOSED WORK WILL SHED LIGHT ON THE ORIGIN OF WATER IN MARTIAN MAGMAS, AS WELL AS THE REDOX EVOLUTION AND D H RATIO OF THE MARTIAN MANTLE, CRUST AND HYDROSPHERE. TECHNICAL APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY FOR DOCUMENTATION AND CHARACTERIZATION, AN ELECTRON MICROPROBE IS AVAILABLE AT ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY ASU. IN SITU ANALYSES OF TRACE ELEMENTS, D H RATIOS AND H2O CONTENTS, WILL BE CONDUCTED USING CAMECA IMS 6F AND NANOSIMS 50L INSTRUMENTS AT ASU.

NASAS SWAS AND ESAS HERSCHEL MISSIONS WERE BOTH BUILT WITH THE OBSERVATION OF WATER AND OXYGEN AS PRIMARY SCIENCE DRIVERS. EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS RELY ON THZ OBSERVATIONS TO CHARACTERIZE THE STRUCTURE OF THE EARTHS ATMOSPHERE (I.E. EOS AURA MLS).

THE FIELD OF TRANSITING EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERE CHARACTERIZATION HAS GROWN CONSIDERABLY OVER THE PAST DECADE GIVEN THE WEALTH OF PHOTOMETRIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC DATA FROM THE HUBBLE AND SPITZER SPACE TELESCOPES. IN ORDER TO INTERPRET THESE DATA, ATMOSPHERIC MODELS COMBINED WITH BAYESIAN APPROACHES ARE REQUIRED. FROM SPECTRA, THESE APPROACHES PERMIT US TO INFER FUNDAMENTAL ATMOSPHERIC PROPERTIES AND HOW THEIR COMPOSITIONS CAN RELATE BACK TO PLANET FORMATION. HOWEVER, SUCH APPROACHES MUST MAKE A WIDE RANGE OF ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE  PHYSICS/PARAMETERIZATIONS INCLUDED IN THE MODEL ATMOSPHERES. THERE HAS YET TO BE A COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION EXPLORING HOW THESE MODEL ASSUMPTIONS INFLUENCE OUR INTERPRETATIONS OF EXOPLANETARY SPECTRA. UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT SINCE THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE (JWST) IS EXPECTED TO INVEST A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ITS TIME OBSERVING TRANSITING PLANET ATMOSPHERES. IT IS THEREFORE PRUDENT TO OPTIMIZE AND ENHANCE OUR TOOLS TO MAXIMIZE THE SCIENTIFIC RETURN FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY DATA TO COME. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS TO DETERMINE THE PIECES OF INFORMATION WE CAN ROBUSTLY LEARN FROM TRANSITING PLANET SPECTRA AS OBTAINED BY JWST AND OTHER FUTURE, SPACE-BASED PLATFORMS, BY INVESTIGATING COMMONLY OVERLOOKED MODEL ASSUMPTIONS. WE PROPOSE TO EXPLORE THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS AND HOW THEY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO INFER EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERIC PROPERTIES: 1. STELLAR/PLANETARY UNCERTAINTIES: TRANSIT/OCCULTATION ECLIPSE DEPTHS AND SUBSEQUENT PLANETARY SPECTRA ARE MEASURED RELATIVE TO THEIR HOST STARS. HOW DO STELLAR UNCERTAINTIES, ON RADIUS, EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE, METALLICITY, AND GRAVITY, AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTIES IN THE PLANETARY RADIUS AND GRAVITY, PROPAGATE INTO THE UNCERTAINTIES ON ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION AND THERMAL STRUCTURE? WILL THESE UNCERTAINTIES SIGNIFICANTLY BIAS OUR ATMOSPHERIC INTERPRETATIONS? IS IT POSSIBLE TO USE THE RELATIVE MEASUREMENTS OF THE PLANETARY SPECTRA TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE STELLAR PROPERTIES? 2. THE 1D ASSUMPTION: ATMOSPHERES ARE INHERENTLY THREE-DIMENSIONAL. MANY EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERE MODELS, ESPECIALLY WITHIN RETRIEVAL FRAMEWORKS, ASSUME 1D PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY WHEN INTERPRETING SPECTRA. HOW DOES THIS 1D ATMOSPHERE ASSUMPTION BIAS OUR INTERPRETATION OF EXOPLANET SPECTRA? DO WE HAVE TO CONSIDER GLOBAL TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS SUCH AS DAY-NIGHT CONTRASTS OR HOT SPOTS? WHAT ABOUT SPATIALLY INHOMOGENEOUS MOLECULAR ABUNDANCES AND CLOUDS? HOW WILL THIS CHANGE OUR INTERPRETATIONS OF PHASE RESOLVED SPECTRA? 3. CLOUDS/HAZES: UNDERSTANDING HOW CLOUDS/HAZES IMPACT TRANSIT SPECTRA IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL IF WE ARE TO OBTAIN PROPER ESTIMATES OF BASIC ATMOSPHERIC QUANTITIES. HOW DO THE ASSUMPTIONS IN CLOUD PHYSICS BIAS OUR INFERENCES OF MOLECULAR ABUNDANCES IN TRANSMISSION? WHAT KIND OF DATA (WAVELENGTHS, SIGNAL-TO-NOISE, RESOLUTION) DO WE NEED TO INFER CLOUD COMPOSITION, VERTICAL EXTENT, SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION (PATCHY OR GLOBAL), AND SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS? THE PROPOSED WORK IS RELEVANT AND TIMELY TO THE SCOPE OF THE NASA EXOPLANET RESEARCH PROGRAM.

GENERATING MAP OF LARGE SCALE (#tilde#1000 KM), HIGH RESOLUTION (#tilde#500 M) AND TIME-DEPENDENT (2003 - 2018) 3D SURFACE DEFORMATION BY COMBINING ALL AVAILABLE GPS DATA AND LARGE SETS OF SAR IMAGES ACQUIRED BY ENVISAT, ALOS 1&2, SENTINEL-1, TERRASAR-X, COSMO- SKYMED SATELLITES. 2.

ONE MINERAL SYSTEM THAT RECORDS A RANGE OF PRE- AND POST-ACCRETIONARY HISTORIES ARE THE FE-SULFIDES. THEY OCCUR IN A WIDE RANGE OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL MATERIALS AND ARE ATTRIBUTED TO FORMING THROUGH A RANGE OF PROCESSES IN THE EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM. SUCH PROCESSES INCLUDE CONDENSATION, CRYSTALLIZATION/EXSOLUTION, GAS-SOLID/LIQUID REACTION, THERMAL METAMORPHISM, AND AQUEOUS-PHASE PROCESSING. PREVIOUS WORK ON HAYABUSA SAMPLES (ASTEROID 25143 ITOKAWA) IMPLIES THEIR SULFIDES FORMED BY THERMAL METAMORPHISM (BEING LL5-6 MATERIAL).THE COMPOSITIONS, MORPHOLOGIES, AND CRYSTAL STRUCTURES OF SULFIDES ARE DETERMINED BY THEIR FORMATION CONDITIONS INCLUDING TEMPERATURE, TIME, OXYGEN AND SULFUR FUGACITY, AND AQUEOUS AND THERMAL HISTORY. WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE STRUCTURES, COMPOSITIONS, AND CONTEXT OF SULFIDE MINERALS IN SAMPLES RETURNED BY HAYABUSA AND COMPARE THESE WITH SULFIDES IN CHONDRITIC METEORITES. WE WILL CONSTRAIN PARENT BODY FORMATION CONDITIONS OF ASTEROID ITOKAWA BY STUDYING ANALOGOUS SULFIDES WITH PETROGRAPHIC CONTEXT IN CHONDRITIC METEORITES. WE WILL ALSO DEVELOP A SULFIDE DATABASE TO INTERPRET CONDITIONS OF FORMATION FOR SULFIDES THAT WILL LIKELY BE FOUND IN SAMPLES RETURNED BY HAYABUSA2 AND OSIRIS-REX.WE WILL IDENTIFY CANDIDATE SULFIDE GRAINS IN CHONDRITIC METEORITES VIA SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (SEM) AND ELECTRON PROBE MICROANALYSIS (EPMA), DETERMINE GRAIN ORIENTATION VIA ELECTRON BACKSCATTER DIFFRACTION (EBSD), AND EXTRACT REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES VIA FOCUSED-ION-BEAM (FIB) TECHNIQUES. WE WILL STUDY THE COMPOSITION, TEXTURE, AND CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF INDIVIDUAL FIB SECTIONS OF THE SULFIDES VIA TRANSMISSION-ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (TEM) TO INVESTIGATE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN FORMATION MECHANISM, OXYGEN AND SULFUR FUGACITY, TEMPERATURE, AND COOLING RATE. WE WILL CONDUCT THE SAME MEASUREMENTS ON ALLOCATED SULFIDE-BEARING HAYABUSA SAMPLES. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SULFIDES (PYRRHOTITE ((FE,NI,CO,CR)1-XS) AND PENTLANDITE ((FE,NI,CO,CR)9-XS8)) IN LL, CI, CM, AND CR CHONDRITES THAT RECORD EQUILIBRATION TEMPERATURES FROM 100 TO 600DEGREES C. STUDYING SULFIDES IN METEORITES THAT RETAIN THEIR PETROGRAPHIC CONTEXT ALLOWS COMPARISONS BETWEEN ESTABLISHED GEOTHERMOMETERS AND THERMODYNAMIC VARIABLES. SINCE PYRRHOTITE-PENTLANDITE INTERGROWTHS ARE UNCOMMON IN SOME METEORITE GROUPS, SULFIDES IN SMALL RETURNED SAMPLES MAY ONLY CONSIST OF PYRRHOTITE OR PENTLANDITE. THEREFORE, TO UNDERSTAND SULFIDE FORMATION IN ASTEROIDS IT IS IMPORTANT TO STUDY SULFIDES IN METEORITES WITH WELL-KNOWN FORMATION CONDITIONS TO INVESTIGATE INDICATORS OF FORMATION IN BOTH PYRRHOTITE AND PENTLANDITE. PETROGRAPHIC, CHEMICAL, AND THERMODYNAMIC ANALYSES ON SULFIDES IN METEORITES VIA SEM, EPMA, EBSD, AND FIB-TEM WILL PROVIDE A DIVERSE SAMPLE SET OF SULFIDES FOR COMPOSITIONAL AND MICROSTRUCTURAL INVESTIGATIONS TO COMPARE WITH RETURNED SAMPLES. THE MOTIVATION FOR THIS RESEARCH IS TO IDENTIFY MICROSTRUCTURAL INDICATORS OF SULFIDE FORMATION CONDITIONS SO THAT PRE- AND/OR POST-ACCRETIONARY FORMATION CONDITIONS CAN BE DETERMINED FOR SAMPLES THAT CONTAIN SULFIDES BUT LACK PETROGRAPHIC CONTEXT, AS MAY BE THE CASE FOR RETURNED SAMPLES.THIS RESEARCH IS RELEVANT TO THE SCOPE OF THE LABORATORY ANALYSIS OF RETURNED SAMPLES (LARS) PROGRAM, BECAUSE IT AIMS TO ''MAXIMIZE THE SCIENCE DERIVED FROM PLANETARY SAMPLE-RETURN MISSIONS''. LARS IS MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THIS RESEARCH SINCE IT IS RELEVANT TO THE SCOPE OF LARS IN C.18: ''DIRECT ANALYSIS OF SAMPLES ALREADY RETURNED TO EARTH''. THE ANALYSES OF METEORITES ARE APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THEY WILL DIRECTLY SUPPORT THE INTERPRETATION OF RETURNED SAMPLES (SPECIFIED IN 1.3.3, C.18).

THE PRELIMINARY STUDIES SHOW THAT  NANOPRECIPITATES ARE THE HOSTS FOR MANY OF THE TRACEELEMENTS IN THE METEORITES, AND REVEALING THEIR DISTRIBUTION IS IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING THE FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM MATERIALS. THIS STUDY WILL ALSO BE EXTENDED TO METALS IN BENCUBBINITES (CB CHONDRITES), WHICH ARE PRIMITIVE, METAL-RICH BRECCIAS CLOSELY RELATED TO CR AND CH CHONDRITES. THE DISPARATE ORIGINS AND THERMAL HISTORIES OF THE METAL FROM IRON METEORITES AND BENCUBBINITES WILL PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION ON NANOPRECIPITATE FORMATION AND COMPOSITION.INTRODUCTION: TRACE ELEMENTS IN IRON METEORITES ARE USED TO MODEL CRYSTALLIZATION PROCESSES THAT OCCURED WITHIN ASTEROIDAL CORES AND TO HELP ELUCIDATE THE FORMATION AND THERMAL HISTORY OF METAL DURING NEBULAR AND PLANETARY DIFFERENTIATION PROCESSES.

FURTHER, THE ROLE OF TRACE ELEMENTS IN ALLOY FORMATION, SOLIDIFICATION, AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES IS WELL DOCUMENTED. IN CONTRAST, THERE ARE VIRTUALLY NO STUDIES OF NON-METAL AND PGE-RICH NANOPRECIPITATES IN IRON METEORITES.PRELIMINARY WORK: I INITIATED A PRELIMINARY TEM-EDS-EELS STUDY AND FOUND ABUNDANT NANOPRECIPITATES OF UNUSUAL COMPOSITIONS IN A RANGE OF IRONS AND A STONY-IRON METEORITE: ODESSA (IAB-MG), BUTLER (UNGROUPED), GIBEON (IVA), CANYON DIABLO (IAB-MG), DEEP SPRINGS (UNGROUPED), BRENHAM (PMG-AN), HENBURY (IIIAB), AND GRESSK (IIAB). NANOPRECIPITATES WERE EXTRACTED BY CUTTING A FRESH SURFACE FOLLOWED BY ETCHING WITH EITHER HNO3/METHANOL OR LIQUID BROMINE. THIS SURFACE WAS THEN COATED WITH A THIN LAYER OF C, WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FLOATED OFF THE METEORITE BY PLACING THE SAMPLE BACK IN THE ETCHANT. THE ADHERING NANOPRECIPITATES WERE THEN STUDIED BY TEM-EDS-EELS. A WIDE RANGE OF NANOPARTICLES WAS DISCOVERED, E.G., PD-BEARING ALLOYS, PGE NUGGETS, GE- AND GA- RICH NI PHOSPHIDES, CR-MO NITRIDES, AND CR SULFIDES WITH PGES. COMPOSITE NANOPRECIPITATES WERE ALSO FOUND IN CANYON DIABLO AND ODESSA, INCLUDING CR-MO NITRIDES WITH ADHERING CAPS OF PD-SN OR FE-NI-P PARTICLES. THESE COMPOSITE NANOPRECIPITATES PROVIDE INFORMATION ON PRECIPITATION SEQUENCE.PROPOSED RESEARCH: NANOPARTICLES WILL BE EXTRACTED AND CHARACTERIZED BY TEM AND ELECTRON-BEAM TECHNIQUES. GIVEN THE CHALLENGES OF QUANTIFYING HEAVY ELEMENTS BY EDS AND EELS, I WILL ALSO USE THE MICRO-PIXE AT ASU FOR THEIR ELEMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION. THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE NANOSCALE PHASE PETROLOGY OF METAL SYSTEMS, WHICH HAS AN IMPORTANT BEARING ON TRACE ELEMENT BEHAVIOR AND IN SOME CASES, LARGER SCALE STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF METAL-RICH METEORITES.PROGRAMMATIC CONSIDERATIONS: THE PROPOSED STUDY IS DESIGNED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOLID-STATE HISTORIES OF METEORITES, THEIR FORMATION, AND ACCRETION. BY ADDRESSING PROBLEMS RELATED TO PROCESSES THAT OCCURRED IN THE EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM, WE WILL PROVIDE FUNDAMENTAL NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE ORIGIN OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM AND ITS SOLID BODIES.

THE POTENTIAL OF A SEISMOMETER TO IDENTIFY LIQUID WATER THAT WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO A LANDER WILL, IN FACT, BE CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING THE GOAL OF NASA S OCEAN WORLDS AND OUTER PLANETS PROGRAM: TO ENABLE IDENTIFICATION OF EXTANT LIFE ON ANOTHER WORLD. HOWEVER, UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE SURFACE OF EUROPA PRESENT PARTICULAR CHALLENGES TO A SEISMIC INSTRUMENT DEPLOYMENT, WHICH MAY AFFECT THE PENETRATION DEPTH AND INSTALLATION ANGLE AND STABILITY OF A SEISMIC SENSOR. FURTHERMORE, UNKNOWN TRADE-OFFS EXIST BETWEEN PURSUING SEISMOLOGICAL GOALS WITH A SINGLE SEISMOMETER VERSUS A LOCALIZED ARRAY OF SEISMIC SENSORS. FINALLY, EUROPA S RADIATION AND EXTREMELY LOW-TEMPERATURE ENVIRONMENT IS SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE MOON, OR MARS, WHERE SEISMIC EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN PLANNED AND/OR CARRIED OUT. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO MATURE A MINIATURE BROADBAND SEISMOMETER FOR DEPLOYMENT ON EUROPA TO PROBE THE PROPERTIES OF ITS ICE SHELL AND INTERIOR STRUCTURE AND RECORD CURRENT ACTIVITY. RECENT ADVANCES IN MICROELECTROMECHANICAL SYSTEM (MEMS) HAVE ENABLED OPTIMIZATION OF SEISMOMETERS FOR SPACEFLIGHT SEISMIC INSTRUMENTATION. FOR EXAMPLE, A SEISMOMETER PACKAGE IS THE PRIMARY INSTRUMENT OF THE INSIGHT MISSION AND CONSISTS OF A 3-AXIS VERYBROADBAND INSTRUMENT, WHICH IS A TRADITIONAL PENDULUM SYSTEM, AND A 3-AXIS SHORT PERIOD MEMS SEISMOMETER, BUILT WITH SILICON-BASED MICROFABRICATION. HOWEVER, THIS PACKAGE HAS NOT YET ACHIEVED THE SIMULTANEOUS REQUIREMENTS FOR LOW MASS AND POWER, HIGH ROBUSTNESS, AND HIGH PERFORMANCE. ITS THEORETICAL NOISE FLOOR IS LIMITED IN SHORT PERIOD, AND THE VACUUM PACKAGING ISSUE HAS POSTPONED LAUNCH FOR AT LEAST FOR TWO YEARS. FURTHERMORE, ITS TOLERANCE ON SHOCK (2KG) AND INSTALLATION ANGLE ( 15 ) LIMITS ITS POTENTIAL USE IN OTHER MISSIONS, ESPECIALLY WITH UNKNOWN ICY SURFACE CONDITIONS ON EUROPA. WE PROPOSE TO MATURE A BROADBAND MINIATURE SEISMOMETER, WHICH USES A MEMS SENSING ELEMENT WITH IONIC LIQUID BASED ELECTROLYTE AS THE SENSING BODY. THIS DESIGN WILL SERVE AS THE BASIS OF A FLIGHT INSTRUMENT FOR A EUROPA LANDER MISSION, CURRENTLY UNDER STUDY. THIS NEW INSTRUMENT PROVIDES BOTH HIGH SENSITIVITY AND DYNAMIC RANGE, BROAD-BAND RESPONSE, AND HIGH ENVIRONMENT TOLERANCES, REACHING OR EXCEEDING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR EUROPA LANDER MISSION SUGGESTED FROM JPL EUROPA LANDER REPORT. IT ALSO HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF FLEXIBLE DEPLOYMENT METHODS DUE TO ITS HIGH SHOCK TOLERANCE (>25 KG),  180  TILT TOLERANCE, AND NO REQUIREMENT OF VACUUM SEALING. WE WILL ACHIEVE THIS GOAL THROUGH THREE OBJECTIVES: 1) MATURATION OF MINIATURE SEISMOMETER TECHNOLOGY FOR USE IN EUROPA S ENVIRONMENT, 2) DETERMINE OPTIMAL SENSOR DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION THROUGH FIELD TESTING WITH EXISTING SEISMOMETERS, 3) MODEL THE EXPECTED SEISMICITY OF EUROPA AND THE CORRESPONDING INSTRUMENT CAPABILITIES AND REQUIREMENTS TO ACHIEVE LANDER MISSION OBJECTIVES. OUR PROPOSED WORK IS RELEVANT TO THE COLDTECH PROGRAM, AS IT WOULD BRING SEISMIC SENSOR CELL, THE CORE MECHANICAL HARDWARE OF A SEISMOMETER INSTRUMENT, TO TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVEL 6 (TRL 6) FOR THE POTENTIAL EUROPA LANDER MISSION. THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES WOULD  DEVELOP AND ADVANCE THE MATURITY OF SCIENCE INSTRUMENTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE FOCUSED ON THE DETECTION OF EVIDENCE OF LIFE, ESPECIALLY EXTANT LIFE, IN THE OCEAN WORLDS OF THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM  AND PROVIDE  SPACECRAFT TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRED TO ACCESS THE OCEANS. . THE SEISMOMETER WE ARE DEVELOPING WILL BE CAPABLE OF IDENTIFYING AND PHYSICALLY CHARACTERIZING THE MOST LIKELY HABITATS ON EUROPA. ITS UNIQUE ROBUSTNESS AND FLEXIBILITY WILL MITIGATE RISK FOR THE EUROPA LANDER MISSION AND PROVIDE A NEW TOOL FOR FUTURE EXPLORATION OF OTHER OCEAN WORLDS."

HOWEVER, SEVERAL CRITICAL CHALLENGES EXIST FOR THE SYSTEMATIC INTEGRATION AND INTERPRETATION OF THE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH NAS. THE MYRIAD OF INFORMATION OFFERED BY VARIOUS DATA SOURCE REQUIRES APPROPRIATE REPRESENTATION AND PROPER FUSION METHODOLOGIES. FURTHERMORE, A LARGE AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY IS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INFORMATION ARISING FROM VARIOUS SOURCES SUCH AS AERONAUTICAL INSTRUMENTATION, ENVIRONMENT, INTRINSIC VARIABILITIES, AND HUMAN FACTORS. COMPLEX SYSTEM SAFETY MODELING OF MULTIPLE FAILURE MODES LOSS OF SEPARATION, MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL SUB SYSTEM FAILURE, MISCOMMUNICATIONS, HUMAN AUTOMATION ERRORS, AND WEATHER RELATED HAZARDS WITH LARGELY UNKNOWN UNCERTAINTY IS EXTREMELY VALUABLE FOR THE SAFE TRANSITION OF THE PRESENT NAS TO NEXTGEN CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, INCREASED DEMAND REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEXTGEN NAS MAY LEAD TO HIGHER RISK LEVELS DUE TO THE REDUCTION OF SAFETY MARGINS AND MAY REQUIRE REAL TIME RESPONSE FOR RISK MITIGATION.

THE HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION COLOR AND MULTISPECTRAL IMAGING CAPABILITIES OF MASTCAM PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL RESOURCE USED TACTICALLY TO HELP CHOOSE SPECIFIC DRIVE PATHS AND REGIONS FOR MORE DETAILED IN SITU ANALYSES AND OCCASIONAL DRILLING. MASTCAM MULTISPECTRAL DATA ALSO ENABLE A LIMITED ANALYSIS OF THE COMPOSITION AND MINERALOGY OF THE LANDING SITE AND TRAVERSE FOR SCIENTIFIC ASSESSMENT PURPOSES. FOR EXAMPLE, 12-POINT SPECTRA ARE SENSITIVE TO THE AMOUNT OF THE DUST COVER ON ROCK SURFACES, THEPRESENCE AND CRYSTALLINITY OF CERTAIN FE-BEARING PHASES, AND WEAK HYDRATION FEATURES IN MINERAL-FILLED VEINS.MASTCAM IMAGES ARE PRESENTLY ONLY BEING ARCHIVED TO THE PDS AS CALIBRATED RADIANCE FACTOR OR I/F (WHERE I IS THE MEASURED RADIANCE, AND PI*F IS EQUAL TO THE ESTIMATED SOLAR IRRADIANCE AT THE TOP OF THE MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE AT THE TIME OF THE OBSERVATION), WITHOUT USING ANY INFORMATION FROM PRE-FLIGHT OR IN-FLIGHT CALIBRATION OR FROM THE ONBOARD MASTCAM CALIBRATION TARGET.

THE RESULT IS THAT USERS WHO ATTEMPT TO CREATE THEIR OWN REFLECTANCE SPECTRAFROM ARCHIVED MASTCAM RADIANCE DATA SETS END UP WITH SPECTRA THAT DEVIATE SUBSTANTIALLY FROM PREVIOUS TELESCOPIC, ORBITAL, LANDER, AND ROVER MULTISPECTRAL MEASUREMENTS OF MARS.

THE PRIMARY AIM OF THESE SESSIONS AND ASSOCIATED ACTIVITIES IS TO ADVANCE SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF EARTH SYSTEMS THROUGH LEARNING AND COLLABORATION ACROSS DISCIPLINARY BOUNDARIES. OUTCOMES FROM SESSIONS CATALYZE NEW RESEARCH INITIATIVES, BUILD CAPACITY WITHIN EXISTING RESEARCH PROGRAMS, SUPPORT THE MISSIONS OF FEDERAL AGENCIES AND OTHER SPONSORS, AND ENGAGE THE PUBLIC ON THE RELEVANCE AND POTENTIAL USES OF SCIENCE REGARDING GLOBAL CHANGE. EACH YEAR, AGCI PURSUES WORKSHOP TOPICS THAT ARE RECOMMENDED BY THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY AND VETTED BY ITS SCIENCE ADVISORY BOARD. AGCI COLLABORATES WITH WORKSHOP CO-CHAIRS RESPECTED LEADERS IN THEIR FIELDS WHO VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME TO DEVELOP A ROSTER AND PROGRAM FOR THE WEEKLONG, INTENSIVE WORK SESSIONS. FOR 2017, SESSIONS ALREADY IN PLANNING WILL FOCUS ON THE TELECONNECTIONS OF POLAR AMPLIFICATION AND IMPROVED METHODS FOR THE EVALUATION OF EARTH SYSTEMS MODELS. BOTH TOPICS ADDRESS RESEARCH PRIORITIES IMPLICIT IN NASA EARTH SCIENCE PROGRAM GOALS AS WELL AS THOSE OF THE U.S. GLOBAL CHANGE RESEARCH PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY, ADVANCEMENTS IN BOTH TOPICS WILL HELP MEET SOCIETAL NEED FOR RELEVANT AND TIMELY DECISION SUPPORT, SUCH AS IMPROVED AND MORE USABLE CLIMATE PROJECTIONS. ONE OR TWO ADDITIONAL TOPICS MAY BE SELECTED FROM A SHORT LIST PROVIDED IN THE PROPOSAL AND PURSUED PENDING FUNDING FROM OTHERS. THE FUNDING REQUESTED WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY SHARE OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO PLAN AND CONDUCT THESE WORKSHOPS, AS WELL AS TO DOCUMENT, REPORT, AND PRODUCE ONLINE EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. AGCI WORKSHOPS ARE EVALUATED AT MULTIPLE POINTS OVER THEIR LIFECYCLE AND RESULTS ARE REPORTED DIRECTLY TO FEDERAL AGENCY SPONSORS. EACH WORKSHOP ORGANIZED BY AGCI INCLUDES A SPECIAL PUBLIC LECTURE WHERE THE PUBLIC IS INVITED TO MEET AND ENGAGE WITH INVITED WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS. FOLLOWING EACH WORKSHOP, VIDEOS OF THE PUBLIC LECTURE AND WORKSHOP SESSIONS ARE POSTED FOR VIEWING BY ANYONE FREE OF CHARGE ON AGCI S WEBSITE, WWW.AGCI.ORG. ADDITIONALLY, AGCI SUPPORTS WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS AND CO-CHAIRS IN DEVELOPING PEER-REVIEWED AND OTHER PUBLICATIONS DESIGNED TO DISSEMINATE WORKSHOP FINDINGS TO MORE TECHNICAL AUDIENCES. THE ASPEN GLOBAL CHANGE INSTITUTE IS AN INDEPENDENT COLORADO NON-PROFIT FOUNDED IN 1989. AGCI S MISSION IS TO FURTHER SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE IN SERVICE OF SOCIETY.

THE CHAMBER WILL USE A TWO-PIECE GRCOP-84 LINER THAT IS INSERTED AND MP WELDED INTO A ONE-PIECE INCONEL 625 STRUCTURAL JACKET. THE MPW STEP WILL BE USED TO PERMANENTLY JOIN THE TWO HALVES OF THE LINER AT THE THROAT AND THE LINER ITSELF TO THE JACKET IN A STRUCTURALLY SOUND, WATERTIGHT MANNER. OUR STRUCTURAL JACKET DESIGN INCLUDES INTEGRAL PROPELLANT MANIFOLDS, WHICH ELIMINATES THE TIME AND EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH MACHINING OR CASTING SEPARATE COMPONENTS AND WELDING THEM IN PLACE. THE BENEFITS OF SUCH A DESIGN ARE SUBSTANTIAL. FIRST, IT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT FOR COMPLICATED COMPONENTS LIKE A MODERN COMBUSTION CHAMBER, AN AM MANUFACTURING APPROACH CAN DRASTICALLY REDUCE COST (BY 50% OR MORE) AND LEAD TIME (WEEKS INSTEAD OF MONTHS). SECOND, OUR PARTICULAR DESIGN OVERCOMES WEAKNESSES OF OTHER ADDITIVE DESIGNS BY ENABLING EASY INSPECTION OF THE PRINTED PARTS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE TO UNDERGO CT SCANNING OR X-RAY INSPECTION, WHICH HAS PROVEN TO BE EXCEPTIONALLY DIFFICULT FOR COMPLEX INTERNAL GEOMETRIES LIKE REGENERATIVE COOLING CHANNELS AND PROPELLANT MANIFOLDS. THIRD, OUR BASIC MATERIAL AND MANUFACTURING APPROACH IS SCALABLE TO BOOSTER CLASS COMBUSTION CHAMBERS AT A RATE CONTROLLED SOLELY BY SCALING OF THE BUILD VOLUMES AVAILABLE IN COMMERCIAL SLM MACHINES (WHICH IS OCCURRING RAPIDLY).

OUR ADAP PROGRAM TO MEASURE THE MASS LOSS FROM THE AGB AND RSG STARS IN THE MAGELLANIC CLOUDS IS NEARING COMPLETION, AND WE WISH TO EXTEND THIS SUCCESSFUL STUDY TO THE GALACTIC BULGE OF THE MILKY WAY GALAXY. METALLICITY SHOULD DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF ELEMENTS AVAILABLE TO CONDENSE DUST IN THE STAR''S OUTFLOW, SO EVOLVED STARS OF DIFFERING METALLICITIES SHOULD HAVE DIFFERING MASS-LOSS RATES.

IN ADDITION, THE GALACTIC BULGE, LIKE THE CLOUDS, IS LOCATED AT A WELLDETERMINED DISTANCE (#tilde#8 KPC), THEREBY REMOVING THE DISTANCE AMBIGUITIES THAT PRESENT A MAJOR UNCERTAINTY IN DETERMINING MASS-LOSS RATES AND LUMINOSITIES FOR EVOLVED STARS. TO MODEL PHOTOMETRIC OBSERVATIONS OF OUTFLOWING DUST SHELLS AROUND EVOLVED STARS, WE HAVE CONSTRUCTED THE GRID OF RED SUPERGIANT AND ASYMPTOTIC GIANT BRANCH MODELS (GRAMS; SARGENT ET AL 2011; SRINIVASAN ET AL 2011) USING THE RADIATIVE TRANSFER CODE 2DUST (UETA AND MEIXNER 2003).

WE WILL USE OUR GRAMS GRID, EXPANDING AS NECESSARY TO ENABLE MODELING OF THE HIGHER METALLICITY EVOLVED STARS OF THE GALACTIC BULGE, ALONG WITH MODELS OF OTHER TYPES OF STARS, SUCH AS YSOS (ROBITAILLE ET AL 2006), TO IDENTIFY THE EVOLVED STARS IN THE GLIMPSE SAMPLE OF THE GALACTIC BULGE.

IT WILL COMBINE ANALYSIS OF NASA HELIOPHYSICS SYSTEM OBSERVATORY DATA PRODUCTS, AND RELEVANT DATA-DRIVEN MODELS INTO AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM FOR THE CHARACTERIZATION OF CORONAL WAVES AND SHOCKS AND THE EVALUATION OF THEIR CAPABILITY TO ACCELERATE SEPS. CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS (CMES) ARE ONE OF THE MAIN PHENOMENA THAT MODIFY SPACE WEATHER IN THE HELIOSPHERE. AMONG OTHER EFFECTS, DURING THEIR HELIOSPHERIC PROPAGATION THEY ROUTINELY DRIVE COLLISIONLESS SHOCKS, WHICH IN TURN MAY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT FLUXES OF SOLAR ENERGETIC PARTICLES (SEPS). RECENT STUDIES HAVE USED EXTREME UV (EUV) OBSERVATIONS TO SHOW THE CONNECTION OF CORONAL EUV WAVES TO METRIC RADIO TYPE II BURSTS IN THE CORONAL PHASES OF CMES. THIS SIGNIFIES THAT CME-DRIVEN SHOCKS CAN EXIST LOW IN THE CORONA, AND MAY ALREADY ACCELERATE SEPS AT THEIR VERY INITIAL STAGES. CHARACTERIZING CORONAL SHOCKS HAS ONLY BECOME POSSIBLE THROUGH REMOTE MEASUREMENTS FROM INSTRUMENTS ON THE SOHO, STEREO, AND SDO SPACECRAFT. EUV IMAGING WITH THE ATMOSPHERIC IMAGING ASSEMBLY(AIA) INSTRUMENT ON SDO HAS PROVED PARTICULARLY USEFUL FOR DETECTING LARGE-SCALE SHORT-LIVED CORONAL BRIGHT FRONTS, WHICH, COMBINED WITH RADIO OBSERVATIONS, HOLDS GREAT PROMISE FOR EARLY CME-DRIVEN SHOCK CHARACTERIZATION CAPABILITY. THIS CHARACTERIZATION CAN FURTHER BE AUTOMATED, AND RELATED TO MODELS OF PARTICLE ACCELERATION TO PRODUCE ESTIMATES OF PARTICLE FLUXES EARLY IN EVENTS. THE CASHEW FRAMEWORK WILL BE EXTENSIVELY TESTED AND VALIDATED ON A REPRESENTATIVE LIST OF CORONAL BRIGHT FRONT EVENTS. SOME OF THE SPECIFIC SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED THROUGH ANALYSES OF THE PROPOSED DATA PRODUCTS ARE 1) TO WHAT ENERGIES CAN CORONAL SHOCKS ACCELERATE SOLAR ENERGETIC PARTICLES? 2) HOW DOES CORONAL SHOCK ACCELERATION EFFICIENCY VARY WITH TIME AND LOCATION? 3) WHAT REMOTE OBSERVABLES ARE RELEVANT FOR DETERMINATION OF SHOCK ACCELERATION EFFICIENCY? THE PRODUCTS OF THE PROPOSED WORK WILL ENABLE AND FACILITATE FUTURE STUDIES OF CORONAL SHOCK WAVE PROPERTIES, AS WELL AS THEIR INFLUENCE ON SEP PRODUCTION AND HELIOSPHERIC CONNECTIVITY.

THE EMISSION WOULD BE SHORT AND STRONGEST FROM CERTAIN VIEWING ANGLES, REQUIRING RAPID CADENCE FOR SEVERAL SNE BEFORE DEFINITIVE CONCLUSIONS CAN BE REACHED. FOR THE 3 SN IA DISCOVERED BY KEPLER MONITORING OF #tilde#500 GALAXIES (OLLING ET AL. 2015), NO SIGNATURES OF A COMPANION WERE FOUND AND TIGHT CONSTRAINTS WERE PLACED. WITH A LARGER SAMPLE, WE CAN DETERMINE THE STATISTICS FOR THE TWO POSSIBLE CHANNELS THAT TRIGGER SN IA. MEANWHILE, FEATURES DUE TO THE DIFFERENT EXPLOSION PHYSICS (DETONATION, DEFLAGRATION, INWARDS-MOVING DIFFUSION WAVES, ETC) OF IA AND CORE COLLAPSE SNE WILL ALSO BE REVEALED. K2 WILL ALLOW FOR THE FIRST TIME TO TEST MODELS MORE COMPLICATED THAN SIMPLE \EXPANDING FIREBALLS.\"" WE WILL UNDERTAKE A MAJOR, CONCURRENT GROUND-BASED EFFORT TO OBSERVE THE ENTIRE FIELD EVERY OTHER DAY USING SKYMAPPER, ATLAS AND DECAM. WE WILL ALSO COORDINATE MULTI-COLOR PHOTOMETRY AND SPECTRA TO CLASSIFY DISCOVERED TRANSIENTS USING LICK, GEMINI, AND KECK. IN CAMPAIGN C5 AND C6, WE SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFIED 4 SNE WITH DECAM OBSERVATIONS, OF WHICH WE CLASSIFIED 2 WITH GEMINI SPECTRA AS SN IA. THESE DATA, COUPLED WITH HIGH PRECISION 30 MINUTE K2 DATA WILL HAVE ENORMOUS LEGACY VALUE. METHODS: WE HAVE DEVELOPED AND PROVEN A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL DETRENDING METHOD THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY SOLVES FOR THE SAWTOOTH PATTERN CAUSED BY POINTING MOTION AND FOR THE COEFFICIENTS OF VECTORS FROM PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS OF TARGETS ON THE SAME CHANNEL. THIS ITERATIVE TECHNIQUE PERMITS US TO DEFINE APERTURE SIZES BETTER SUITED TO THIS PROBLEM AND TO MAKE EXCELLENT CORRECTIONS FOR SENSITIVITY VARIATIONS ON ALL TIME SCALES. TO PROPERLY CORRECT SN LIGHT CURVES, THE TECHNIQUE IS APPLIED TO THE QUIET TIME BEFORE THE EVENT AND THEN EXTRAPOLATED TO THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN.

AN IMPORTANT GOAL OF SOLAR PHYSICS IS THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS OF SOLAR ACTIVITY, AS A PROBLEM IN ITS OWN RIGHT AND FOR ITS IMPORTANCE IN DETERMINING SPACE WEATHER. SOME CLUES TO THE PUZZLE SHOULD ARISE FROM STUDYING THE PHYSICAL PROCESSES IN THE DEEP CONVECTION ZONE SINCE IT IS THE MOTIONS IN THIS REGION THAT ARE THOUGHT TO REGENERATE THE POLOIDAL MAGNETIC FIELD FROM THE TOROIDAL MAGNETIC FIELD, AN ESSENTIAL PROCESS THAT ALLOWS THE SOLAR CYCLE TO CONTINUE. WHILE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED IN UNDERSTANDING SOLAR CONVECTION-ZONE DYNAMICS AND ITS RELATION TO SURFACE ACTIVITY, SOME IMPORTANT PROBLEMS STILL REMAIN, SUCH AS THE NATURE OF THE DEEP MERIDIONAL FLOW THAT DRIVES THE DYNAMO. RECENT MEASUREMENTS OF EQUATORWARD COMPONENT OF THE MERIDIONAL FLOW FROM HMI AND GONG DATA SHOW SIMILAR PATTERN OF GENERAL PICTURE OF THE FLOW PROFILE. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SOME CONTROVERSIAL RESULTS AS WELL. FOR EXAMPLE MULTI-CELL STRUCTURE OF THE MERIDIONAL FLOW (IN DEPTH AND LATITUDE) IS DIFFERENT IN TWO INDEPENDENT MEASUREMENTS. MOST OF THE DISAGREEMENTS MAY BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THESE MEASUREMENTS ARE NOT FROM STANDARD HMI OR GONG DATA PRODUCT. THEY ARE DERIVED USING DIFFERENT PROCESSING AND MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES. STANDARD PIPELINES DOES NOT PRODUCE SUCH TYPE OF DATA. MOREOVER, DEEP FLOW MEASUREMENTS ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO ANALYSIS METHODS AND PARAMETERS OF DATA PROCESSING E.G. PROJECTION, FILTERING ETC. WE PROPOSE TO CREATE VERY UNIQUE AND SPECIALIZED DATA PRODUCTS WHICH WILL CATER TO ALL INTERESTED HELIOPHYSICS COMMUNITY WITH A UNIFORMLY PROCESSED AND WELL ACCEPTED PROCESSING PARAMETERS SINCE STANDARD HMI PIPELINE DOES NOT PRODUCE SUCH TYPE OF DATA. FURTHER, PROCESSING OF SUCH DATA SETS IS COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE. THUS, AVAILABILITY OF THESE DATA WILL FACILITATE MANY RESEARCH GROUPS TO WORK ON UNIFORM DATA EVEN IF THEY DO NOT HAVE THE PROCESSING CAPABILITIES TO PRODUCE SUCH DATA."

THE OST, A MID- TO FAR- INFRARED OBSERVATORY CONCEPT, IS BEING DEVELOPED AS A MAJOR NASA MISSION TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE NEXT DECADAL SURVEY WITH SUPPORT FROM NASA HEADQUARTERS. THE OBJECTIVE OF SUCH A FACILITY IS TO ALLOW RAPID SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEYS OF THE HIGH REDSHIFT UNIVERSE AT 420-800  M, USING ARRAYS OF INTEGRATED SPECTROMETERS WITH MODERATE RESOLUTIONS (R= #tilde#1000), TO CREATE A POWERFUL NEW DATA SET FOR EXPLORING GALAXY EVOLUTION AND THE GROWTH OF STRUCTURE IN THE UNIVERSE. A SECOND OBJECTIVE OF OST IS TO PERFORM HIGHER RESOLUTION (R#tilde#10,000-100,000) SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEYS AT 20-300  M, A UNIQUELY POWERFUL TOOL FOR EXPLORING THE EVOLUTION OF PROTOPLANETARY DISKS INTO FLEDGLING SOLAR SYSTEMS. FINALLY THE OST AIMS TO OBTAIN SENSITIVE MID-INFRARED (5-40  M) SPECTROSCOPY OF THERMAL EMISSION FROM ROCKY PLANETS IN THE HABITABLE ZONE USING THE TRANSIT METHOD. THESE OST SCIENCE OBJECTIVES ARE VERY EXCITING AND REPRESENT A WELL-ORGANIZED COMMUNITY AGREEMENT. HOWEVER, THEY ARE ALL IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH WITHOUT NEW DETECTOR TECHNOLOGY, AND THE OST CAN T BE RECOMMENDED OR APPROVED IF SUITABLE DETECTORS DO NOT EXIST. IN ALL OF THE ABOVE INSTRUMENT CONCEPTS, PHOTON-COUNTING DIRECT DETECTORS ARE MISSIONENABLING AND ESSENTIAL FOR REACHING THE SENSITIVITY PERMITTED BY THE CRYOGENIC ORIGINS SPACE TELESCOPE AND THE PERFORMANCE REQUIRED FOR ITS IMPORTANT SCIENCE PROGRAMS. OUR GROUP HAS DEVELOPED AN INNOVATIVE DESIGN FOR AN OPTICALLY-COUPLED KID THAT CAN REACH THE PHOTON-COUNTING SENSITIVITY REQUIRED BY THE AMBITIOUS SCIENCE GOALS OF THE OST MISSION. A KID IS A PLANAR MICROWAVE RESONATOR PATTERNED FROM A SUPERCONDUCTING THIN FILM, WHICH RESPONDS TO INCIDENT PHOTONS WITH A CHANGE IN ITS RESONANCE FREQUENCY AND DISSIPATION. THIS DETECTOR RESPONSE IS INTRINSICALLY FREQUENCY MULTIPLEXED, AND CONSEQUENTLY KIDS AT DIFFERENT RESONANCE FREQUENCIES CAN BE READ OUT USING STANDARD DIGITAL RADIO TECHNIQUES, WHICH ENABLES MULTIPLEXING OF #tilde#10,000S OF DETECTORS. IN OUR PHOTON-COUNTING KID DESIGN WE EMPLOY A SMALL-VOLUME (AND THIN) SUPERCONDUCTING AL INDUCTOR TO ENHANCE THE PER-PHOTON RESPONSIVITY, AND LARGE PARALLEL-PLATE NBTIN CAPACITORS ON SINGLE-CRYSTAL SILICON-ON-INSULATOR (SOI) SUBSTRATES TO ELIMINATE FREQUENCY NOISE. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A COMPREHENSIVE DESIGN DEMONSTRATING THAT PHOTON-COUNTING SENSITIVITY IS POSSIBLE IN A SMALL-VOLUME AL KID. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED ULTRA-HIGH QUALITY FACTORS IN RESONATORS MADE OF VERY THIN (#tilde#10 NM) AL FILMS WITH LONG ELECTRON LIFETIMES. THESE ARE THE CRITICAL MATERIAL PARAMETERS FOR REACHING PHOTON-COUNTING SENSITIVITY LEVELS. IN OUR PROPOSED WORK PLAN OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO IMPLEMENT THESE HIGH QUALITY FILMS INTO OUR OPTICALLYCOUPLED SMALL-VOLUME KID DESIGN AND DEMONSTRATE PHOTON-COUNTING SENSITIVITY. THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PHOTON-COUNTING TECHNOLOGY WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE SENSITIVITY OF THE OST MISSION, MAKING IT MORE SCIENTIFICALLY COMPETITIVE THAN ONE BASED ON POWER DETECTORS. PHOTON-COUNTING AT THE BACKGROUND LIMIT PROVIDES A X4 INCREASE IN OBSERVATION SPEED OVER THAT OF BACKGROUND-LIMITED POWER DETECTION, SINCE THERE IS NO NEED TO MEASURE AND SUBTRACT A ZERO POINT. PHOTON-COUNTING DETECTORS WILL ENABLE AN INSTRUMENT ON THE OST TO OBSERVE THE FINE STRUCTURE LINES OF GALAXIES WHICH ARE CURRENTLY ONLY OBSERVABLE AT REDSHIFTS OF Z#tilde#1, OUT TO REDSHIFTS OF Z=6, PROBING THE EARLY STAGES OF GALAXY, STAR AND PLANET FORMATION. OUR PHOTONCOUNTING DETECTORS WILL ALSO ENABLE ENTIRELY NEW SCIENCE, INCLUDING THE MAPPING OF THE COMPOSITION AND EVOLUTION OF WATER AND OTHER KEY VOLATILES IN PLANET-FORMING MATERIALS AROUND LARGE SAMPLES OF NEARBY YOUNG STARS."

ONE KEY PATHWAY IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF FREE-FLOATING SUBSTELLAR OBJECTS THAT NOT ONLY SHARE COMMON TEMPERATURES WITH EXOPLANETS BUT ALSO COMMON MASSES AND THUS SURFACE GRAVITIES. IN RECENT YEARS, SEARCHES FOR EVER COLDER FREE-FLOATING OBJECTS HAVE STEADILY PUSHED THE CENSUS TO EVER LOWER MASSES AND FINALLY INTO THIS LONG-SOUGHT PLANETARY-MASS REGIME (5-15 JUPITER MASSES;  Y  DWARFS). THE EMPIRICAL BACKBONE OF THE EXPLORATION OF THESE NEW SUBSTELLAR SAMPLES IS THE ACCURATE MEASUREMENT OF DISTANCES VIA TRIGONOMETRIC PARALLAXES. DISTANCES ALLOW US TO MAKE EMPIRICAL SEQUENCES OF ABSOLUTE MAGNITUDE VERSUS COLOR AND SPECTRAL TYPE TO COMPARE TO BETTER STUDIED  NORMAL  BROWN DWARFS, AS WELL AS PROVIDING ABSOLUTE BOLOMETRIC FLUXES AND THEREBY LUMINOSITIES AND TEMPERATURES. HOWEVER, UNLIKE SIMPLE PHOTOMETRY OR SPECTROSCOPY, PARALLAX MEASUREMENTS ARE TIME CONSUMING AND PRONE TO LARGE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS WHEN ATTEMPTED BY COMBINING DATA FROM MULTIPLE TELESCOPES AND BANDPASSES. SPITZER/IRAC IS POISED TO DELIVER THE DEFINITIVE SAMPLE OF PARALLAX DISTANCES FOR THE COLDEST BROWN DWARFS. IT IS THE ONLY FACILITY CAPABLE OF MEASURING HIGH-PRECISION ASTROMETRY EFFICIENTLY FOR A LARGE SAMPLE OF SUCH FAINT SUBSTELLAR OBJECTS, AS VALIDATED BY OUR PAST WORK. SPITZER WAS NEVER INTENDED TO DELIVER HIGH QUALITY ASTROMETRY, BUT USING OUR CUSTOM BUILT ASTROMETRIC PIPELINE WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY PRODUCED THE FIRST PRECISE IRAC ASTROMETRY AND MEASURED DISTANCES FOR A SMALL INITIAL SAMPLE OF THE COLDEST BROWN DWARFS (DUPUY&KRAUS 2013). WE SHOWED THAT IN SPITE OF THE SEEMINGLY SUBTLE SPECTRAL CHANGES FROM T8 TO Y0 (ONLY 2 SUBTYPES), THE MEAN EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE PLUMMETS BY ALMOST A FACTOR OF 2, FROM #tilde#700 K FOR T8 DWARFS TO #tilde#400 K FOR Y0 DWARFS. EVEN IN THIS SMALL SAMPLE, WE FOUND SOME OBJECTS THAT SEEMED TO DEFY THE EXPECTATION THAT LATER SPECTRAL TYPE CORRESPONDS TO COOLER TEMPERATURE. THIS MAY POINT TO COMPLEXITY IN THE ATTEMPT TO SPECTRAL TYPE PLANETARY MASS OBJECTS, AS OTHER PARAMETERS LIKE GRAVITY OR NONEQUILIBRIUM CHEMISTRY COULD BECOME JUST AS IMPORTANT AS TEMPERATURE. HOWEVER, A SAMPLE LARGER THAN ONE OR TWO OBJECTS PER SPECTRAL TYPE BIN IS REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY DEFINITIVE STATEMENTS ABOUT PHYSICAL TRENDS. WE PROPOSE A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF THE COLDEST KNOWN BROWN DWARFS BY MEASURING ACCURATE DISTANCES FROM SPITZER PARALLAXES. WE WILL USE ALL DATA IN THE SPITZER ARCHIVE SUITABLE FOR PARALLAXES TO PERFORM A HOMOGENEOUS ANALYSIS OF A COMPLETE SAMPLE OF THE LATEST T AND Y DWARFS. OUR PROPOSED WORK WILL ROUGHLY TRIPLE THE SAMPLE SIZE AND FILL IN MAJOR GAPS AT THE T9.5 AND>Y0 SPECTRAL TYPES (#tilde#300-350 K) THAT PRODUCED SOME OF THE MOST PUZZLING RESULTS IN OUR PREVIOUS WORK. THE LONGER TIME BASELINE WILL ENABLE>3X MORE PRECISE PARALLAX MEASUREMENTS THAN IS POSSIBLE FROM THE GROUND FOR SIMILARLY FAINT OBJECTS. THE RESULTING EMPIRICAL SEQUENCES OF ABSOLUTE MAGNITUDE WILL PROVIDE A TOUCHSTONE FOR COMPARING BOTH MODELS AND DATA, E.G., FROM DIRECTLY IMAGED EXOPLANETS. WE WILL ALSO USE THE ABSOLUTE FLUXES TO DERIVE BOLOMETRIC LUMINOSITIES FOR OUR SAMPLE. COMBINING THESE WITH WELL-ESTABLISHED MODEL RADII WILL RESULT IN ROBUST TEMPERATURE DETERMINATIONS THAT WILL ALLOW DEEPER SCRUTINY OF WHETHER TEMPERATURE OR A MORE COMPLEX MIX OF PHYSICAL PROPERTIES DRIVES SPECTRAL VARIATIONS IN THE PLANETARY MASS REGIME. FINALLY, OUR ASTROMETRIC MONITORING WILL NATURALLY ALLOW US TO EXAMINE THE POPULATION S KINEMATICS, AND THE LONG TIME BASELINE WILL ALLOW A NOVEL SEARCH FOR LOWER MASS COMPANIONS VIA NONLINEAR PERTURBATIONS. OUR PROPOSED WORK WILL RESULT IN A DEFINITIVE BENCHMARK SAMPLE FOR BOTH THE BROWN DWARF AND EXOPLANET COMMUNITIES, PROVIDING CONTEXT FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE EFFORTS TO CHARACTERIZE BROWN DWARFS, DIRECTLY IMAGED PLANETS, AND THE COOL TRANSITING PLANETS PROBED BY SECONDARY ECLIPSE MEASUREMENTS."

OVER THE COURSE OF 10 MILLION YEARS, ACCRETION DISKS AROUND PRE-MAIN SEQUENCE STARS TRANSFORM FROM GAS-RICH REMNANTS OF STAR FORMATION INTO YOUNG PLANETARY SYSTEMS. THE PRIMARY PLANET-FORMING REGION IN THESE PROTOPLANETARY DISKS IS LOCATED WITHIN 20 ASTRONOMICAL UNITS AU OF THE SYSTEM S CENTER. THIS REGION IS CHARACTERIZED BY A MIXTURE OF WARM AND COLD GAS, DUST AND ICE, AND HAS BEEN ANALYZED USING A RANGE OF MOLECULAR AND ATOMIC LINES AND SOLID-STATE FEATURES IN THE MID- TO FAR-INFRARED. HOWEVER TO DELVE MORE DEEPLY TOWARD UNDERSTANDING PLANET FORMATION AND THE CREATION OF PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES REQUIRES THE HIGH-RESOLUTION MID- TO FAR-INFRARED (IR) SPECTROSCOPY HIRMES PROVIDES. HIRMES IS DESIGNED TO PERFORM DETAILED STUDIES OF IMPORTANT DISK CONSTITUENTS: WATER VAPOR AND ICE THESE MATERIALS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN FORMING GIANT PLANET CORES AND PRODUCING HABITABLE CONDITIONS ON TERRESTRIAL PLANETS, AND NEUTRAL OXYGEN, AT TRACER OF DISK CHEMISTRY AND RADIAL STRUCTURE. HIRMES ALSO MEASURES MOLECULAR HYDROGEN THROUGH ITS TRACER, HYDROGEN DEUTERIDE HD WHICH SHOULD MAKE UP MOST OF A PROTOPLANETARY DISK MASS, BUT IS NOT ACCESSIBLE WITH EXISTING INSTRUMENTS. HIRMES, WITH ITS HIGH SPECTRAL RESOLUTION, RESOLVES NARROW EMISSION LINES AND INDEPENDENTLY DETERMINES THEIR ORIGIN IN A DISK FROM VELOCITY INFORMATION, THUS BREAKING DEGENERACIES IN COMPLEX DISK MODELS. HIRMES MEASUREMENTS TRACE DISK DENSITY, TEMPERATURE, AND VELOCITY STRUCTURE, AS WELL AS H2O VAPOR AND ICE TO LOCATE THE TRANSITION ZONE BETWEEN GASEOUS AND FROZEN WATER. OBSERVATIONS OF H2 OR BETTER YET ITS DEUTERATED COUNTERPART HD, CAN UNIQUELY DETERMINE THE DISK GAS MASS AND THE DEGREE OF SETTLING OF THE SOLID MATERIAL IN DISKS.

THE INFRARED SPECTROGRAPH IRS ON SPITZER PROVIDED DATA UP TO #tilde#37 M WITH A SPECTRAL RESOLVING POWER OF 600, WHICH IS TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE LESS THAN HIRMES AND INSUFFICIENT TO RESOLVE LINES FROM PROTOPLANETARY DISKS. HIRMES RANGE CONTAINS THE TWO WATER-ICE FEATURES THAT ARE THE ONLY EMISSION TRACERS OF ICE IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS AND HAVE BEEN POORLY COVERED BY PREVIOUS SPACE MISSIONS.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE SPEED AND PROFILE OF THE MERIDIONAL FLOW DETERMINES THE DURATION OF THE SOLAR CYCLE IN FLUX-TRANSPORT DYNAMO MODELS, ITS RISE AND FALL PATTERN, THE POLAR FIELD STRENGTH AND THE TIMING OF ITS REVERSAL. THE STRENGTH OF THE POLAR FIELD OF THE PREVIOUS MINIMUM PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN DETERMINING THE STRENGTH OF THE NEXT CYCLE. THEREFORE IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE EVOLUTION OF THE POLAR FIELD, WHICH IS LARGELY GOVERNED BY THE TRANSPORT BY MERIDIONAL CIRCULATION. WE PROPOSE TO STUDY THE MERIDIONAL FLOW IN THE SOLAR CONVECTION ZONE FROM THE SURFACE TO THE NEAR-SURFACE SHEAR LAYER USING RING-DIAGRAM ANALYSIS AND IN THE LOWER CONVECTION ZONE USING TIME-DISTANCE ANALYSIS ANALYZING SDO/HMI DOPPLERGRAMS. WE WILL THEN ASSIMILATE THE MERIDIONAL FLOW AND THE SURFACE MAGNETIC FIELD FROM SDO/ HMI INTO FLUX-TRANSPORT DYNAMO MODELS AND DRIVE THE MODELS WITH THE FLOWS. TO COVER MORE THAN ONE SOLAR CYCLE, WE WILL ANALYZE MDI DATA SETS. THE GOALS OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT ARE (I) TO DETERMINE THE INFLUENCE OF THE MERIDIONAL FLOW ON DYNAMO-GENERATED MAGNETIC FIELDS DURING DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE SOLAR CYCLE AND (II) TO USE THE RESULTS TO PREDICT THE POLAR FIELDS DURING THE UPCOMING CYCLE MINIMUM AND THE STRENGTH OF CYCLE 25. THIS IS TIMELY SINCE SDO/HMI OBSERVATIONS COVER SOLAR CYCLE 24 AND THE HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF HMI ALLOWS US TO MEASURE SUBSURFACE MERIDIONAL FLOWS AT HIGH LATITUDES TO ABOUT 75 DEGREE. BY ASSIMILATING MERIDIONAL FLOWS AND SURFACE MAGNETIC FIELDS FROM SDO/HMI INTO DYNAMO MODELS, WE WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE HOW WELL FLOW MEASUREMENTS CAN CONSTRAIN THE DYNAMO. RELEVANCE: THIS PROPOSAL DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE FIRST SCIENCE GOAL FROM THE HELIOPHYSICS DECADAL SURVEY:  DETERMINE THE ORIGINS OF THE SUN S ACTIVITY AND PREDICT THE VARIATIONS IN THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT . THE WORK PROPOSED HERE WILL GREATLY ENHANCE THE SCIENTIFIC RETURN OF THE SDO/HMI MISSION. METHODOLOGY: WE PROPOSE TO DETERMINE THE MERIDIONAL FLOW FROM SDO/HMI DOPPLERGRAMS USING TWO DIFFERENT HELIOSEISMIC TECHNIQUES. TO DETERMINE THE MERIDIONAL FLOW FROM THE SURFACE TO A DEPTH OF ABOUT 40 MM ON TIME SCALES OF DAYS AND MONTHS, WE WILL USE RINGDIAGRAM ANALYSIS WITH THREE TILE SIZES. TO DISCERN THE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ACTIVE REGIONS, WE WILL STUDY FLOWS FROM SMALL 5 DEGREE TILES. TO REACH DEPTHS OF ABOUT 40 MM AND STUDY THE INFLUENCE OF THE NEAR-SURFACE SHEAR LAYER, WE WILL USE FLOWS FROM 30 DEGREE TILES. WE WILL CROSS-VALIDATE THESE RESULTS WITH THOSE FROM THE STANDARD 15 DEGREE TILES COVERING DEPTHS FROM THE SURFACE TO ABOUT 16 MM. TO DETERMINE THE MERIDIONAL FLOW IN THE LOWER HALF OF THE CONVECTION ZONE ON TIME SCALES OF TWO YEARS, WE WILL USE A CUSTOMIZED TIMEDISTANCE ANALYSIS. THE KEY POINT IS TO PERFORM THE ANALYSIS IN SPHERICAL GEOMETRY, WHICH ALLOWS US TO ISOLATE ACOUSTIC WAVES PROPAGATING TO DEEP LAYERS. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO CONSTRAIN THE RETURN FLOW NEAR THE BASE OF THE CONVECTION ZONE AND THE NUMBER OF CELLS WITH DEPTH. WE WILL USE AN ENSEMBLE KALMAN FILTER TO ASSIMILATE THE SUBSURFACE MERIDIONAL FLOW AND THE SURFACE MAGNETOGRAMS INTO THE DYNAMO MODEL AND OPERATE THE MODEL IN THE ANALYSES AND THE FORECAST MODE, SO THAT WE CAN RESOLVE UNCERTAINTIES IN MODEL INGREDIENTS IN THE ANALYSES PHASE AND CORRECTLY HINDCAST AND FORECAST THE POLAR FIELDS AND PROPERTIES OF SOLAR CYCLES 24 AND 25 IN THE FORECAST PHASE. WE WILL CHECK THE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE MERIDIONAL FLOWS DETERMINED IN THE UPPER AND LOWER CONVECTION ZONE ON DIFFERENT TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL SCALES, AS WELL AS WHETHER THE MODEL WORKS BEST WITH HIGH OR LOW MAGNETIC DIFFUSIVITY. WE WILL DETERMINE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERIDIONAL FLOW AT HIGH LATITUDES FOR THE POLEWARD FLUX TRANSPORT AND POLAR FIELD FEATURES, AND IN TURN FOR THE CYCLE 25 AMPLITUDE"

MAGNETIC FIELDS FORM A FOUNDATION FOR ALL SOLAR ACTIVE PHENOMENA FROM TINY G-BAND BRIGHT POINTS TO SUNSPOTS AND CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS (CMES). THEY SERVE AS A RESERVOIR OF ENERGY FOR FLARES, PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN TRIGGERING MECHANISMS FOR CMES, AND PROVIDE THE MEANS OF TRANSPORTING ENERGY FROM THE PHOTOSPHERE TO CORONA. THUS, ARGUABLY, THE MAGNETOGRAPH SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A CRITICAL INSTRUMENT FOR EVERY HELIOPHYSICS MISSION THAT STUDIES THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE OR THE EFFECTS OF SOLAR ACTIVITY ON HELIOSPHERE. WHILE THE IMPORTANCE OF MAGNETOGRAPH INSTRUMENT IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED BY THE COMMUNITY, IN PRACTICE, THEIR INCLUSION AS A SPACECRAFT PAYLOAD IS OFTEN LIMITED DUE TO WEIGHT AND SIZE RESTRICTIONS. THE MAGNETOGRAPH CONCEPTS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY IN USE REQUIRE SAMPLING A MAGNETO-SENSITIVE SPECTRAL LINE AT DIFFERENT POSITIONS ACROSS SOLAR DISK. SPECTROGRAPH-BASED MAGNETOGRAPHS ARE SUPERIOR IN TERMS OF SPECTRAL SAMPLING, BUT REQUIRE SCANNING OF SOLAR IMAGE TO BUILD UP ITS MAGNETIC MAP. NARROW-BAND FILTER-BASED MAGNETOGRAPHS TAKE SIMULTANEOUS  SNAPSHOTS  OF EXTENDED AREA OF SOLAR SURFACE, BUT REQUIRE TAKING MULTIPLE OBSERVATIONS WITH DIFFERENT WAVELENGTH OFFSET BETWEEN SEPARATE FRAMES. BOTH APPROACHES MAY REQUIRE RELATIVELY LARGE NUMBER OF OPTICAL AND ELECTRO-MECHANICAL ELEMENTS FOR SPECTRAL TUNING AND/OR SPATIAL SCANNING. THESE ADDITION ELEMENTS TEND TO INCREASE THE OVERALL WEIGHT AND SIZE OF INSTRUMENT, AND THE ADDED COMPLEXITY MIGHT AFFECT THE RELIABILITY OF SYSTEM. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: AS THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS PROJECT, WE WILL EXPLORE A NOVEL ALTERNATIVE TO THE STANDARD FILTER BASED MAGNETOGRAPH, WHICH WE CALL THE SIMPLEST MAGNETOGRAPH. THE PROPOSED INSTRUMENT CONCEPT IS BASED ON MEASURING A BROAD-BAND POLARIZATION OVER THE WHOLE LINE PROFILE, WHICH COULD BE DONE WITHOUT MOVING OPTICAL ELEMENTS AND COMPLICATED OPTICAL SCHEMES. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS CONCEPT WILL LEAD TO CREATION OF EXTREMELY SIMPLE AND COMPACT LINE-OF-SIGHT (LOS) OR FULL VECTOR MAGNETOGRAPH SUITABLE FOR SPACE MISSIONS. SUCH INSTRUMENT COULD BE ESPECIALLY ATTRACTIVE FOR SPACE WEATHER-ORIENTED MISSIONS. THE METHODOLOGY: THE CONCEPT OF THE PROPOSED MAGNETOGRAPH IS BASED ON A WELL-KNOWN FACT THAT ZEEMAN SPLIT SPECTRUM LINES IN A LINEOF- SIGHT (LOS) FIELD ARE ASYMMETRIC, WITH ONE OF THE V STOKES PROFILE LOBES STRONGER THAN THE OTHER IN A WAY THAT SWITCHES WITH POLARITY. IN TRANSVERSE FIELD, THERE IS A NET LINEAR POLARIZATION AVERAGED ACROSS THE LINE PROFILE BECAUSE THE CENTRAL PART OF THE SPECTRUM LINE IS SATURATED RELATIVE TO THE WINGS SO THE WING POLARIZATION DOMINATES IN Q AND U POLARIZATION PROFILES. THUS, MEASURING NET POLARIZATION OVER THE ENTIRE SPECTRAL LINE PROFILE (WITHOUT SCANNING IN SPECTRAL OR SPATIAL DIRECTIONS) ALLOWS TO DETERMINE BOTH POLARITY AND THE FIELD STRENGTH (MAGNETIC FLUX) FOR EACH PIXEL OF IMAGE. PRELIMINARY TESTS WITH STOKES-V SPECTRA TAKEN WITH GONG INSTRUMENT SUPPORT THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS APPROACH. PROPOSED CONTRIBUTION: THE NSO TEAM WILL INVESTIGATE THE CONCEPT OF THIS SIMPLEST MAGNETOGRAPH BOTH VIA MODELING AND LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS. WE WILL ALSO BUILD A PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT. THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS MAGNETOGRAPH WILL BE TESTED AT THE GROUNDBASED TELESCOPES OPERATED BY THE NSO. IN ADDITION, THE PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT CAN BE PROPOSED FOR FLIGHT ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AND PERHAPS ALSO ON MISSION OF OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS THE UK/EU LAGRANGE L5 MISSION."

THE EVOLUTION OF ACTIVE REGIONS IS OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE IN SOLAR PHYSICS. SINCE ACTIVE REGIONS ARE FORMED FROM STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS GENERATED BY A SOLAR DYNAMO LOCATED IN THE SOLAR INTERIOR, THEIR EVOLUTION FROM EMERGENCE THROUGH DECAY PROVIDES CRUCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE SOLAR DYNAMO AND THUS ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF THE SUN S ACTIVITY. SUBSURFACE FLOW PARAMETERS CAN SERVE AS PROXIES OF THE MAGNETIC STRUCTURE IN SUBSURFACE LAYERS AND LINK THE DYNAMICS OF SUBSURFACE LAYERS WITH THE CONDITIONS OF THE MAGNETIC ACTIVITY IN THE PHOTOSPHERE AND ABOVE. STUDIES OF SUBSURFACE FLOWS HAVE FOCUSED MAINLY ON FLARE-PRODUCTIVE REGIONS OR ON THE EMERGENCE OF ACTIVE REGIONS. HOWEVER, A SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF THE EVOLUTION OF SUBSURFACE FLOWS OF ACTIVE REGIONS FROM EMERGENCE TO DECAY WITH REGARD TO THEIR MORPHOLOGY HAS YET TO BE PERFORMED. ACTIVE REGIONS EVOLVE DURING THEIR LIFE TIME AND THE SUBSURFACE FLOWS ARE EXPECTED TO CHANGE AS WELL. WE PROPOSE TO STUDY THE SUBSURFACE FLOWS OF ACTIVE REGIONS OBSERVED BY SDO/HMI THROUGHOUT THE SOLAR CYCLE. WE WILL FOCUS ON, FOR EXAMPLE, LONG-LIVED ACTIVE REGIONS, EMERGING AND DECAYING REGIONS, FLARING AND NON-FLARING REGIONS, AND REGIONS WITH AND WITHOUT ROTATING SUNSPOTS. THE GOAL IS TO ESTABLISH COMMON FEATURES OF THE SUBSURFACE DYNAMICS OF ACTIVE REGIONS AND DIFFERENTIATE THEM FROM CHARACTERISTICS THAT DEPEND ON THEIR MORPHOLOGY. THE RESULTING FLOW PROFILES WILL PROVIDE CRUCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE MAGNETIC FLUX OF ACTIVE REGIONS AND HOW IT IS SYNTHESIZED, CONCENTRATED, AND DISPERSED.DATA: WE WILL USE DOPPLERGRAMS AND MAGNETOGRAMS OBTAINED BY THE HMI INSTRUMENT ONBOARD THE SDO SPACECRAFT. THESE HIGHRESOLUTION OBSERVATIONS ALLOW US TO MEASURE SUBSURFACE FLOWS AT GREAT DISTANCES FROM DISK CENTER AND THUS FOLLOW THE EVOLUTION OF ACTIVE REGIONS DURING THEIR DISK PASSAGE FOR A MUCH LONGER PERIOD OF TIME THAN POSSIBLE WITH PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS. THE AVAILABILITY OF SIMULTANEOUS VECTOR MAGNETOGRAMS WILL ALLOW US TO FOLLOW THE EVOLUTION OF ACTIVE REGIONS AT THE SOLAR SURFACE AND TO DERIVE SURFACE FLOWS AS WELL. METHODOLOGY: WE WILL PERFORM A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF THE SUBSURFACE AND SURFACE FLOWS OF ACTIVE REGIONS AND THEIR TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL EVOLUTION. WE WILL DERIVE THE SUBSURFACE FLOWS DURING THE DISK PASSAGE OF EACH ACTIVE REGION WITH RING-DIAGRAM AND TIMEDISTANCE ANALYSIS (TWO WELL-ESTABLISHED HELIOSEISMIC TECHNIQUES) OF HMI DOPPLERGRAMS. IN ADDITION TO USING FLOWS FROM THE HMI RING-DIAGRAM PIPELINE, WE WILL CUSTOMIZE THE TECHNIQUES TO DERIVE FLOWS ON A FINER TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL GRID APPROPRIATE FOR ACTIVE REGIONS. AT THE SURFACE, FLOWS AND EVOLUTION OF MAGNETIC ACTIVITY WILL BE DERIVED FROM THE CORRESPONDING HMI VECTOR MAGNETOGRAMS USING ESTABLISHED CORRELATION TRACKING TECHNIQUES TO DERIVE SURFACE FLOWS. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO MATCH THE SURFACE WITH THE SUBSURFACE EVOLUTION OF ACTIVE REGIONS. RELEVANCE: THE PROPOSED STUDY OF SUBSURFACE DYNAMICS OF ACTIVE REGIONS WILL LEAD TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE EVOLUTION OF ACTIVE REGIONS. THE PROPOSAL IS THUS RELEVANT TO THE FOLLOWING GOAL OF THE SDO PROJECT: HOW IS ACTIVE REGION MAGNETIC FLUX SYNTHESIZED, CONCENTRATED, AND DISPERSED ACROSS THE SOLAR SURFACE?

THIS WOULD BE A UNIQUE DATA SET FOR THE SOLAR PHYSICS COMMUNITY SINCE THE CONTINUOUS MDI OBSERVATIONS HAVE NEVER BEEN USED TO PRODUCE SUBSURFACE FLOWS USING RING-DIAGRAM (RD) TECHNIQUE. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO INFER SUBSURFACE HORIZONTAL FLOWS USING THE RING-DIAGRAM TECHNIQUE, ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL TOOLS OF LOCAL HELIOSEISMIC ANALYSIS. THIS METHOD HAS BEEN WIDELY USED TO MEASURE THE FLOWS USING HIGH-RESOLUTION DOPPLERGRAMS FROM GONG, MDI AND HMI. HOWEVER FOR RING ANALYSIS, THE OBSERVATIONS FROM MDI HAVE BEEN SUITABLE ONLY DURING THE \DYNAMICS PROGRAM\"" WHICH NORMALLY OCCURRED ABOUT 2 MONTHS IN A YEAR. DUE TO TELEMETRY LIMITATIONS, THE DATA FROM OTHER PERIODS WERE DOWN-SAMPLED, TRUNCATED AT OUTER SOLAR LIMB AND DOWNLOADED IN LOWER RESOLUTION WHICH IS NOT SUITABLE FOR STANDARD RING ANALYSIS. AS A RESULT, RD ANALYSIS USING MDI DATA CAN BE CARRIED OUT INFREQUENTLY ONLY DURING THE 2-MONTH PERIOD IN A YEAR ALTHOUGH MDI OBSERVATIONS ARE AVAILABLE CONTINUOUSLY OVER A PERIOD OF 15 YEARS COVERING TWO MINIMUM AND ONE MAXIMUM PERIODS OF SOLAR ACTIVITY. THUS, OUR AIM IS TO USE THE CONTINUOUSLY AVAILABLE LOW-TELEMETRY MDI DATA FROM THE LOW-ACTIVITY PERIOD BEFORE CYCLE 23 THROUGH THE RISING PHASE OF CYCLE 24. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO PRODUCE CONTEMPORARY DATA SETS OF ZONAL AND MERIDIONAL FLOWS IN THE UPPER CONVECTION ZONE FOR THE COMPLETE SOLAR CYCLE 23. NOTE THAT THE FLOWS FROM GONG ARE AVAILABLE FROM JUNE 2001 AND DO NOT COVER THE LOW-ACTIVITY AND RISING PHASE OF CYCLE 23. METHODOLOGY: WE WILL USE MDI SPHERICAL HARMONIC (SH) TIME SERIES FROM JSOC, TO RECONSTRUCT SEVERAL 30 BY 30 DEGREE PATCHES AROUND CENTRAL MERIDIAN AND EQUATOR. USE OF THIS SH TIME SERIES HAS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES FIRST, IT HAS BEEN GENERATED FROM THE CORRECTED VELOCITY IMAGES (DISTORTION, APODIZATION ETC.), AND SECONDLY, A SMOOTH TRANSITION NEAR THE SURFACE LAYERS CAN BE PERFORMED BY APPLYING SPECIFIC FILTERS TO THE SH TIME SERIES IN SPHERICAL GEOMETRY. RECONSTRUCTION OF VELOCITY IMAGES USING THE SH COEFFICIENT TIME SERIES (INVERSE SH DECOMPOSITION) WILL BE CARRIED OUT WITH THE EXISTING TIME-DISTANCE PIPELINE DEVELOPED BY US AT NATIONAL SOLAR OBSERVATORY. THIS PIPELINE IS WELL TESTED AND VALIDATED BY MEASURING DEEP MERIDIONAL FLOW PROPERTIES. THESE BIG RING PATCHES (30 DEGREE IN DIAMETER AS OPPOSED TO 15 DEGREE PATCHES USED IN THE STANDARD RING DIAGRAM) WILL BE SUBSEQUENTLY USED TO INFER SUBSURFACE FLOW TO A DEPTH OF 30 MM BY PERFORMING CUSTOM RING ANALYSIS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT, OUR DATA PRODUCT, THE MERIDIONAL FLOW AND ITS TEMPORAL VARIATIONS AT DIFFERENT DEPTHS OVER 15 YEARS WILL PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT DATA SET TO COMPARE WITH MEASUREMENTS OBTAINED FROM THE TIME-DISTANCE TECHNIQUE. AVAILABILITY OF THIS DATA PRODUCT WILL ALLOW INTERESTED RESEARCH TEAMS TO INVESTIGATE SOLAR CYCLE AND LONG-TERM VARIATIONS OF FLOWS AND DYNAMICS OF THE UPPER CONVECTION ZONE OVER THE WHOLE MDI TIME EPOCH IN CONTRAST TO THOSE AVAILABLE OVER A LIMITED PERIOD OF ONLY TWO MONTHS A YEAR. IN SUMMARY, WE PLAN TO GENERATE NEW DATA PRODUCTS FROM THE CONTINUOUS MDI OBSERVATIONS SPANNING A PERIOD OF ABOUT 15 YEARS. THESE PRODUCTS INCLUDE: (I) ZONAL AND MERIDIONAL FLOWS AS A FUNCTION OF THE LATITUDE, DEPTH AND TIME, (II) CUSTOM DATA CUBES IN AND AROUND WELL-KNOWN LARGE ACTIVE REGIONS FOR BETTER INVESTIGATION OF FLOW PATTERN AROUND THEM, AND (III) RECONSTRUCTED DOPPLERGRAMS FOR THE ENTIRE DURATION OF MDI OBSERVATIONS.

WHEN COMBINED, THE SPITZER DATA REVEAL THE DUSTIEST OBJECTS AND CAN BE USED TO ESTIMATE A GLOBAL DUST INPUT.

PRIMITIVE MATERIAL LEFT OVER FROM THE FORMATION OF OUR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM HAS FOR A LONG TIME YIELDED TANTALIZING CLUES TO A HETEROGENOUS NEBULA WITH INTRICATE DYNAMICAL, THERMAL AND CHEMICAL STRUCTURE THAT ULTIMATELY LED TO A GREAT DIVERSITY IN THE PLANETS AND PLANETESIMALS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. THE DISCOVERY OF A RICH CHEMISTRY IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS VIA A FOREST OF STRONG 3-40 MICRON MOLECULAR EMISSION LINES (H2O, OH, CO2, HCN, C2H2,...) ALLOWS US FOR THE FIRST TIME TO INVESTIGATE CHEMICAL DIVERSITY IN OTHER PLANET-FORMING ENVIRONMMENTS (SALYK ET AL. 2008; CARR&amp;NAJITA 2008). FURTHER EFFORTS, SUPPORTED BY THE ORIGINS PROGRAM, HAS ESTABLISHED THAT THIS MOLECULAR FOREST IS SEEN IN THE DISKS SURROUNDING MOST YOUNG SOLAR-TYPE STARS (PONTOPPIDAN ET AL. 2010).  WE PROPOSE A 3-YEAR PROGRAM TO ANALYZE OUR GROWING MULTI-WAVELENGTH DATABASE OF OBSERVATIONS OF WATER, OH AND ORGANIC MOLECULES IN THE SURFACES OF PROTOPLANETARY DISKS. THE DATABASE INCLUDES HIGH (R#tilde#25,000-100,000) AND MEDIUM RESOLUTION (R#tilde#600-3000) 3-200 MICRON SPECTRA FROM A WIDE RANGE OF FACILITIES (KECK-NIRSPEC, VLT-CRIRES, SPITZER-IRS, VLT-VISIR, GEMINI-MICHELLE AND HERSCHEL-PACS). OUR PREVIOUS EFFORTS HAVE FOCUSED ON DEMONSTRATING FEASIBILITY FOR OBSERVING WATER AND OTHER MOLECULES IN PLANET-FORMING REGIONS, BUILDING STATISTICS TO SHOW THAT THE MOLECULAR FOREST IS UBIQUITOUS IN DISKS AROUND LOW-MASS AND SOLAR-TYPE STARS AND TAKING THE FIRST STEPS IN UNDERSTANDING THE IMPLIED CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES. NOW, AS THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP, WE WILL COMBINE MULTI-WAVELENGTH DATA FROM OUR UNIQUE MULTI-WAVELENGTH DATABASE TO MAP THE RADIAL DISTRIBUTION OF, IN PARTICULAR, WATER AND ITS DERIVATIVES.  1)	WE WILL USE BOTH LINE PROFILE INFORMATION FROM THE HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTRA, AS WELL AS LINE STRENGTHS, FROM A COMBINATION OF HIGH AND LOW TEMPERATURE LINES TO CONSTRAIN THE RADIAL ABUNDANCE OF WATER VAPOR IN THE EMITTING SURFACES OF DISKS. DESPITE HIGH WATER ABUNDANCES INSIDE #tilde#1 AU, THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE DISK SURFACES ARE STRONGLY DEPLETED IN WATER BOTH FROM THE GAS AND ICE PHASES, BY AS MUCH AS 6 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE, BEYOND 1-2 AU. THIS MAY BE DUE TO THE SETTLING OF ICY GRAINS AS PART OF THE FORMATION OF ICY  PLANETESIMALS (MEIJERINK ET AL. 2009; BERGIN ET AL. 2010). WE WISH TO QUANTIFY THE DEPLETION FACTOR AND ESTABLISH WHETHER THIS IS A COMMON PROPERTY OF ALL PROTOPLANETARY DISKS.  2)	WE WILL PURSUE CRITICAL NEW DATASETS USING UPCOMING OBSERVATIONAL FACILITIES, INCLUDING SPECTRALLY RESOLVED ROTATIONAL WATER LINES IN THE MID-INFRARED. VLT-VISIR, WITH WHICH WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DETECTED WATER LINES AT HIGH RESOLUTION, IS UNDERGOING A SIGNIFICANT HARDWARE UPGRADE WITH A PLANNED COMMISSIONING AROUND JANUARY 2012. THE UPGRADE INCLUDES A MUCH LARGER AND MORE SENSITIVE DETECTOR BASED ON TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED FOR JWST-MIRI, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE ITS EFFICIENCY BY 1-2 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. ON A LONGER TIME SCALE, SOFIA-EXES, JWST-NIRSPEC AND MIRI WILL BECOME ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR MOVING THIS FIELD FORWARD. PONTOPPIDAN IS A JWST-NIRSPEC INSTRUMENT SCIENTIST AT STSCI.  3)	3) WE WILL SEARCH FOR VARIABILITY OF WATER LINES ON TIME SCALES OF MONTHS AND COMPARE THEM TO VARIATION ALREADY SEEN IN CO GAS TO INVESTIGATE ITS ORIGIN. ONE INTRIGUING POSSIBILITY IS DYNAMICAL INTERACTION WITH PROTOPLANETS.   THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS HIGHLY RELEVANT FOR THE ORIGINS OF SOLAR SYSTEMS PROGRAM AS DESCRIBED IN THE SOLICITATION DOCUMENT. IT FALLS INTO THE CATEGORIES DEALING WITH &quot;OBSERVATIONS RELATED TO UNDERSTANDING THE FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF PLANETARY SYSTEMS&quot; AND &quot;STUDIES OF CHEMICAL PROCESSES RELATED TO THE FORMATION OF PLANETARY SYSTEMS.&quot;"

MEASURING THE ENERGETICS OF OUTFLOWS IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR NASA''S SCIENCE OBJECTIVE OF UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECT OF ENERGETIC PROCESSES AROUND SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLES ON THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT IN GALAXIES, CLUSTERS AND THE INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM. THEREFORE, THE MOST IMPORTANT GOALS IN THE STUDY OF THESE OUTFLOWS ARE TO MEASURE THEIR MASS FLUX, KINETIC LUMINOSITY, AND CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES IN ORDER TO ASSESS THEIR IMPORTANCE TO AGN FEEDBACK ON THEIR ENVIRONMENT. THE BROAD RANGE OF REDSHIFTS AND THE ACCESS TO SHORT REST WAVELENGTHS MADE POSSIBLE BY FAR ULTRAVIOLET SPECTROSCOPIC EXPLORER (FUSE) OBSERVATIONS OF AGN OPENS A VAST DISCOVERY SPACE USING THE MANY MORE DIAGNOSTIC LINES (COMPARED TO LONGER WAVELENGTHS) IN THE 500-1050 A RANGE (REST WAVELENGTHS) THAT SHOW UP AS ABSORPTION TROUGHS IN AGN OUTFLOWS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR THE DENSITY-SENSITIVE EXCITED-STATE TRANSITIONS OF HIGHLY IONIZED ELEMENTS (E.G., OIV* 790) THAT CAN YIELD THE DISTANCE OF THE OUTFLOWS FROM THE CENTRAL SOURCE, AND THE INCREASINGLY HIGHER IONIZATION SPECIES (O VI, NE VIII, NA IX AND MG X) THAT SUPPLY THE CRUCIAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE UV AND XRAY (SO-CALLED WARM ABSORBERS) MANIFESTATION OF AGN OUTFLOWS. OVER THE COURSE OF ITS 10 YEARS OF OPERATION, FUSE OBSERVED NEARLY TWO HUNDRED ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI (AGN) AT REDSHIFTS FROM LESS THAN 0.01 TO NEARLY 3. WHILE A SELECT FEW OF THE BRIGHTEST INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS HAVE BEEN STUDIED IN DETAIL, THE SURVEYS OF THE OVERALL DATA SET DONE TO DATE EXAMINED ONLY THE LOWEST REDSHIFT OBJECTS (Z<0.15), AND ONLY USING DATA FROM THE FIRST 6 YEARS OR SO OF THE MISSION. OUR PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF THE FUSE ARCHIVE REVEALS DOZENS OF AGN WITH APPROPRIATE CHARACTERISTICS FOR US TO CARRY OUT OUR PROPOSED PROGRAM OF STUDY. MANY OF THE BEST OBJECTS ALSO HAVE HST SPECTRA AVAILABLE, AND WE WILL USE THESE DATA TO PROVIDE COMPLEMENTARY MEASUREMENTS OF ABSORPTION LINES AT LONGER WAVELENGTHS. FOR THOSE OBJECTS WITH AVAILABLE X-RAY OBSERVATIONS, WE WILL ALSO USE THOSE DATA TO HELP UNDERSTAND THE FULL RANGE OF IONIZATION STATES IN THE ABSORBING GAS. OUR WORK WILL INVOLVE FIVE STEPS TO OBTAINING REAL MEASUREMENTS OF THE MASS FLUX, KINETIC LUMINOSITY, AND THE ABUNDANCES IN A LARGE SAMPLE OF AGN: 1. WE WILL MEASURING RELIABLE IONIC COLUMN DENSITIES FROM THE OBSERVED ABSORPTION TROUGHS, USING THE HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTRA TO OVERCOME THE EFFECTS OF NON-BLACK SATURATION. 2. WE WILL USE PHOTOIONIZATION MODELS TO MEASURE THE IONIZATION STATE AND TOTAL OUTFLOWING COLUMN DENSITY, FACILITATED BY OUR MEASUREMENTS OF ABSORPTION IN MULTIPLE IONIC STATES IN THE FUSE (AND HST) SPECTRA. 3. WE WILL DETERMINE THE CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES, INCLUDING RELATIVE ABUNDANCES FROM THE PHOTOIONIZATION MODELS, AND ABSOLUTE ABUNDANCES (I.E., RELATIVE TO HYDROGEN) SINCE WITH FUSE (TOGETHER WITH HST WHEN AVAILABLE) WE MEASURE SEVERAL LINES IN THE LYMAN SERIES, ALLOWING FOR AN ACCURATE DETERMINATION OF HI. 4. WE WILL DETERMINE THE DISTANCE OF THE OUTFLOW FROM THE CENTRAL SOURCE BY MEASURING THE NUMBER DENSITY (N_H) VIA TROUGHS FROM METASTABLE LEVELS AND USING THE N_H AND IONIZATION PARAMETER (U) TO SOLVE FOR THE DISTANCE OF THE ABSORBING GAS. 5. WE WILL CONSTRAIN THE FRACTION OF SOLID ANGLE SUBTENDED BY THE OUTFLOW FROM THE CENTRAL CONTINUUM SOURCE BY USING THE FRACTION OF OUTFLOWS DETECTED IN OUR LARGE SAMPLE AS A PROXY FOR THE GLOBAL COVERING FRACTION. AS A PRODUCT OF OUR STUDY, WE WILL OPTIMALLY REPROCESS AND PRODUCE HIGH QUALITY MERGED SPECTRA FOR ALL THE FUSE OBSERVATIONS OF AGN, WHICH WE WILL SUBMIT TO THE MAST ARCHIVE FOR FURTHER USE BY THE ASTRONOMICAL COMMUNITY. OUR PROPOSAL WILL ENHANCE THE VALUE OF THE DATA FROM THE FUSE MISSION, AND IT WILL COMPLEMENT ONGOING STUDIES WITH HST AND CHANDRA."

FLARES ARE OFTEN SEEN AS A TUMULTUOUS BREAKUP OF A PREVIOUSLY STABLE CONFIGURATION LEADING TO RELEASE OF A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ENERGY, MATERIAL ERUPTION, PARTICLE ACCELERATION, AND RESTRUCTURING OF MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION. THIS MAGNETIC RESTRUCTURING MAY BE A KEY FOR UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSICS OF PROCESSES TAKING PLACE THROUGHOUT THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE IN RESPONSE TO FLARES: MAGNETIC FIELD SUPPLIES ENERGY TO FLARES, AND SERVES AS A TRIGGER AND AS A CONDUIT OF ENERGY TRANSPORT. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO INVESTIGATE THE MAGNETIC RESTRUCTURING ASSOCIATED WITH FLARES AND ITS EFFECTS ON THERMODYNAMIC PROCESSES IN THE LOW SOLAR ATMOSPHERE. THE CHANGES IN THE MAGNETIC FIELD WILL BE EVALUATED IN RESPECT TO TWO ALTERNATIVE MODELS: CORONAL IMPLOSION AND TWIST REMOVAL MODEL. EITHER OF THESE SCENARIOS MAY TAKE PLACE IN FLARES, BUT THE TWO MODELS CAN BE DISTINGUISHED BASED ON EXPECTED MAGNETIC FIELD CHANGES. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS BASED ON FULL VECTOR MAGNETIC FIELD DATA FROM TWO NASA MISSIONS, SDO AND HINODE, AND SUPPLEMENTED WITH OBSERVATIONS FROM TWO GROUND-BASED INSTRUMENTS, GONG (LINE-OF-SIGHT ONLY) AND SOLIS (VECTOR DATA). THESE TWO AUXILIARY DATA SETS WILL ENHANCE THE INTERPRETATION OF SDO DATA, STRENGTHEN THE STATISTICS. THE AUXILIARY DATA SETS COULD BE CRITICAL IN FINDING THE PROPER INTERPRETATION IN CASES WHEN THE MAGNETIC FIELD DERIVATIONS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE POOR SPECTRAL RESOLUTION OF HMI, OR HAMPERED BY THE POOR TEMPORAL CADENCE OF SOT/SP. THESE DATA SETS WILL ALSO ALLOW INCLUDING FLARES PRIOR TO SDO LAUNCH FOR GREATER STATISTICAL SAMPLE, IF NEEDED. SOLIS CA II 854.2 NM LINE-OF-SIGHT (LOS) MAGNETOGRAMS WILL EXPAND THE STUDY TO THE CHROMOSPHERE. USING SDO VECTOR MAGNETOGRAMS WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE CHANGES IN ORIENTATION AND STRENGTH OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD AND THE ASSOCIATED CHANGES IN LORENTZ FORCE. FOR SELECTED CASES, WE WILL ALSO DERIVE PSEUDO-VECTOR FIELDS USING HIGH-CADENCE SDO/HMI AND GONG LINE-OF-SIGHT (LOS) MAGNETOGRAMS BASED ON THE APPROACH OF AZIMUTHAL AVERAGING. EVOLUTION OF THE DERIVED PSEUDO-VECTOR FIELDS DURING FLARES WILL BE INVESTIGATED AND VALIDATED WITH THE RESULT FROM SDO/HMI VECTOR MAGNETOGRAMS. TO INVESTIGATE CHANGES IN THERMODYNAMIC PARAMETERS ASSOCIATED WITH FLARES, WE WILL USE EXISTING OBSERVATIONS OF FLARING REGIONS WITH THE STOKES POLARIMETER ON HINODE. IN ADDITION, WE WILL USE EXISTING FLARE OBSERVATIONS WITH SOLIS FOR A FEW SELECTED FLARES AND CONDUCT NEW OBSERVATIONS IF NEEDED. AS A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT, SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL SOLIS OBSERVATIONAL FLARE CAMPAIGNS WERE CONDUCTED IN THE PAST. THE USE OF SOLIS DATA WILL ENHANCE THE INTERPRETATION OF SDO/HMI SPECTRAL DATA AS SOLIS/VSM HAS HIGHER SPECTRAL SAMPLING AS COMPARED WITH SDO/HMI DATA. CHANGES IN THERMODYNAMIC PARAMETERS WILL SHOW THE EFFECT OF FLARES THROUGH THE FORMATION HEIGHT RANGE OF THE FE I 630.1-630.2 NM PHOTOSPHERIC AND CA I 854.2 NM CHROMOSPHERIC SPECTRAL LINES. FINALLY, WE WILL COMPARE THE LOCATION OF FOOTPOINTS OF FLARE LOOPS DERIVED FROM RHESSI OBSERVATIONS IN AN ENERGY RANGE OF 50-300 KEV WITH THE LOCATIONS THAT SHOW SIGNIFICANT TOPOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE MAGNETIC FIELD. WE WILL EXAMINE THE RATE OF FLUX LOSS IN THE RECONNECTION EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH FLARES. WE EXPECT THAT THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY WILL BRING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF PHYSICS OF FLARE PROCESSES IN ACTIVE REGIONS AND CONSTRAIN SOME EXISTING FLARE MODELS."

THEREFORE, K2 DATA WOULD ENABLE FOR THE FIRST TIME A HIGH PRECISION COMPARISON OF THE VARIABILITY CHARACTERISTICS OF SOLAR ANALOGS TO THAT OF THE SUN, WHICH IS CHARACTERIZED BY CYCLE RELATED VARIABILITY AT THE LEVEL OF ABOUT 0.1   1 MMAG  AND A SUPERIMPOSED ROTATIONAL MODULATION BY SPOTS WITH AMPLITUDES IN THE 1   3 MILLIMAG RANGE. OUR PRIMARY OBSERVATIONAL OBJECTIVE IN THIS PROPOSAL IS TO OBTAIN ESTIMATES OF ROTATION PERIODS OF SOLAR TYPE STARS IN M67 WITH PREVIOUS CA II ACTIVITY MEASUREMENTS FROM GIAMPAPA.  2006, APJ, 651, 444. THE RESULTS FROM THIS PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS FOR  1 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ACTIVITY AND ROTATION AT SOLAR AGE AND  2  THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM EVOLUTION IN SUN LIKE STARS.  THE SOLAR COUNTERPARTS IN M67 HAVE AN APPARENT BRIGHTNESS OF V   14.5. THEREFORE, THE BENCHMARK PRECISION OF 170 PPM FOR V 12 G2 V STARS IN ONE LONG CADENCE  LC  OBSERVATION CAN BE ATTAINED IN 5 HOURS OR THE EQUIVALENT OF 10 LC OBSERVATIONS. ALTERNATIVELY, A PRECISION OF 0.5 MMAG NEEDED TO RESOLVE ROTATIONAL MODULATION IN THE 0.1  0.2  RANGE COULD BE ACHIEVED IN ABOUT 0.6 HOURS OR TWO LC SEQUENCES.

A KEY OBSERVATIONAL CHALLENGE OF THE NEXT DECADE WILL BE TO UNDERSTAND THE LINKS BETWEEN THE FORMATION OF PLANETS IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS AND THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF EXOPLANETS. POTENTIALLY HABITABLE PLANETS IN PARTICULAR ARE LIKELY FORMED BY SOLIDS GROWING WITHIN RADII OF A FEW AU, AUGMENTED BY UNKNOWN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM VOLATILES FORMED AT LARGER RADII OF 10-50 AU. THE BASIC CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THESE INNER DISK REGIONS IS CHARACTERIZED BY NEAR- TO FAR-INFRARED (2-200 MICRON) EMISSION LINES FROM MOLECULAR GAS AT TEMPERATURES OF 50-1500 K. A CRITICAL STEP TOWARD MEASURING THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF PLANET-FORMING REGIONS IS THEREFORE TO CONVERT OBSERVED INFRARED MOLECULAR LINE FLUXES, PROFILES AND IMAGES TO GAS TEMPERATURES, DENSITIES AND MOLECULAR ABUNDANCES. HOWEVER, CURRENT TECHNIQUES TYPICALLY EMPLOY APPROXIMATE RADIATIVE TRANSFER METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS OF LOCAL THERMODYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM (LTE) TO RETRIEVE ABUNDANCES, LEADING TO UNCERTAINTIES OF ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE AND INCONCLUSIVE COMPARISONS TO CHEMICAL MODELS. ULTIMATELY, THE SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF THE HIGH QUALITY SPECTROSCOPIC DATA EXPECTED FROM THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE (JWST) WILL BE LIMITED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF RADIATIVE TRANSFER TOOLS FOR INFRARED MOLECULAR LINES. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A NUMERICALLY ACCURATE, NON-LTE 3D LINE RADIATIVE TRANSFER CODE, NEEDED TO INTERPRET MID-INFRARED MOLECULAR LINE OBSERVATIONS OF PROTOPLANETARY AND DEBRIS DISKS IN PREPARATION FOR THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE (JWST). THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY ADDING CRITICAL FUNCTIONALITY TO THE EXISTING MONTE CARLO CODE LIME, WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED TO SUPPORT (SUB)MILLIMETER INTERFEROMETRIC OBSERVATIONS. IN CONTRAST TO EXISTING INFRARED CODES, LIME CALCULATES THE EXACT STATISTICAL BALANCE OF ARBITRARY COLLECTIONS OF MOLECULAR LINES, AND DOES NOT USE LARGE VELOCITY GRADIENT (LVG) OR ESCAPE PROBABILITY APPROXIMATIONS. HOWEVER, TO USE LIME FOR INFRARED LINE RADIATIVE TRANSFER, NEW FUNCTIONALITY MUST BE ADDED AND TESTED, SUCH AS DUST SCATTERING, UV FLUORESCENCE, AND INTERFACES WITH PUBLIC STATE-OF-THE ART 3D DUST RADIATIVE TRANSFER CODES (E.G., RADMC3D) AND THERMO-CHEMICAL CODES (E.G, PRODIMO). INFRARED TRANSITIONS OF MOLECULES EXPECTED TO BE UBIQUITOUS IN JWST SPECTRA CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE GOOD DATABASES APPLICABLE TO ASTROPHYSICAL MODELING AND PROTOPLANETARY DISKS, INCLUDING WATER, OH, CO2, NH3, CH4, HCN, ETC. OBTAINING ACCURATE SOLUTIONS OF THE NON-LTE LINE TRANSFER PROBLEM IN 3D IN THE INFRARED IS COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE. WE PROPOSE TO BENCHMARK THE NEW CODE RELATIVE TO EXISTING, APPROXIMATE METHODS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY ARE ACCURATE, AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. WE WILL ALSO CREATE CONVERSION TABLES BETWEEN MID-INFRARED LINE STRENGTHS OF WATER, OH, CH4, NH3, CH3OH, CO2 AND OTHER SPECIES EXPECTED TO BE OBSERVED WITH JWST, AND THEIR RELATIVE ABUNDANCES IN PLANET-FORMING REGIONS.

POSSIBLE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN HOST-STAR CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS MASS OR CHEMICAL COMPOSITION, AND THE UNDERLYING NATURE OF DAUGHTER PLANETARY SYSTEMS, SUCH AS MASSES OR EVEN ORBITAL ARCHITECTURES, WILL BE EXTENDED TO THE REGIME OF THE M-DWARFS. LOW-RESOLUTION SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSES OF M-DWARFS CAN PROVIDE OVERALL ESTIMATES OF STELLAR PARAMETERS, BUT THESE CANNOT PROVIDE THE DETAILED CHEMICAL ABUNDANCE SIGNATURES WHICH CAN BE ANALYZED IN HIGH-RESOLUTION APOGEE SPECTRA, SUCH AS INDIVIDUAL C, N, O, NA, MG, AL, SI, S, K, CA, TI, MN, FE, OR NI ABUNDANCES, SOME OF WHICH PLAY FUNDAMENTAL ROLES IN PLANET FORMATION.

ALGORITHMS DEVELOPED AND ANALYZED IN PHASE I WILL BE EXTENDED TO A WIDE RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL MODELS AND SWARM VEHICLE DYNAMICS, INCLUDING PLANETARY ROVERS AND ORBITING SPACECRAFT. THE SWARM TECHNOLOGY WILL BE IMPLEMENTED FOR REAL-TIME INTEGRATED SYSTEM USE, WITH IDENTIFICATION OF DIFFERENT FORMATION CONFIGURATIONS AND SENSOR COMBINATION FOR HARDWARE INTEGRATION. A SWARM DESIGN SOFTWARE TOOL WILL BECREATED TO ALLOW USERS TO UTILIZE THE DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY IN PROPOSED MISSION ANALYSIS. DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE BENEFITS OF THE TECHNOLOGY WILL BE PRESENTED IN SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE DEMONSTRATIONS, INCLUDING SMALL MOBILE ROBOTS USED TO EMULATE LARGE SWARMS. FUTURE DEMONSTRATION MISSIONS IDENTIFIED IN THE PHASE II WILL SHOW THE MISSION ENHANCEMENTS OF THE OPERATIONAL SYSTEM."

THIS ONE METER TELESCOPE WILL CREATE A MONUMENTAL CHANGE IN FAINT NEA OBSERVATIONS, BECOMING THE LARGEST FULL TIME NEOO TELESCOPE IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE DEDICATED TO THE RECOVERY OF V23.0-24.0 MAGNITUDE NEOS. UTILIZING THIS ONE METER TELESCOPE FOR V23RD NEA RECOVERY WILL PROVIDE LONGER ORBITAL ARCS ON NEWLY DISCOVERED ASTEROIDS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO RECOVER V23RD MAGNITUDE SINGLE OPPOSITION NEAS. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL: 1) PRODUCE 2,000, V23RD MAGNITUDE MEASURES PER YEAR DURING DARK TIME AND, 2) PROVIDE A LARGE APERTURE TELESCOPE TO RECOVER FAINT NEOCP OBJECTS AND NEWLY DISCOVERED NEAS DURING FULL MOON. NEA FOLLOW-UP IS CRITICAL TO THE REDUCTION OF ORBITAL UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE FOLLOW-UP TELESCOPES UTILIZING BOTH NON-SIDEREAL TRACKING AND VECTOR CO-ADDING TECHNIQUES CAN OBSERVE ASTEROIDS MUCH FAINTER THAN THE DISCOVERY TELESCOPES IN DRIFT SCAN. THE ASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE HAS PERFECTED THIS TECHNIQUE ALLOWING 0.61-M TELESCOPES AT CTIO TO OBSERVE ASTEROIDS AS FAINT AS V23.0 WITH A 30 MINUTE VECTOR CO-ADDED IMAGE. THIS SAME TECHNIQUE WILL ALLOW CTIO S 1.0-M TO OBSERVE ASTEROIDS AS FAINT AS V24.0. APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY: CTIO S ONE METER CASSEGRAIN REFLECTOR BUILT BY BOLLER AND CHIVENS IN 1965 HAS BEEN OPERATIONAL AT CTIO SINCE 1974. THE TELESCOPE WILL BE AUTOMATED USING DAN GRAY S SIDEREAL TECHNOLOGIES HARDWARE AND WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE SKYNET REMOTELY OPERATED TELESCOPE NETWORK. CTIO S ONE METER TELESCOPE WILL BE CONTROLLED ALONGSIDE THE EXISTING NASA FUNDED PROMPT TELESCOPES ALLOWING A SINGLE OPERATOR TO MANAGE ALL OPERATIONS. THIS OBSERVING METHOD IS THE MOST COST EFFICIENT BECAUSE THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ASTEROID TARGETING, DATA REDUCTION, AND DATA TRANSFER ARE ALREADY FULLY AUTOMATED. UTILIZING A SINGLE TELESCOPE OPERATOR TO HANDLE ALL OF SSNEO S OPERATIONS MAXIMIZES THESE ASSETS PREVENTING DUPLICATION OF OBSERVATIONS AS WELL AS BETTER CONTROL OF THE TELESCOPE SYSTEM RELATIVE TO WEATHER PATTERNS. CTIO S 1.0-M TELESCOPE WILL CONCENTRATE ALL DARK OBSERVING TIME TO RECOVERY OF V23.0-24.0 MAGNITUDE NEOS AND NEAR FULL MOON WILL ASSIST IN FAINT NEOCP AND NEWLY DISCOVERED OBJECTS TO PREVENT THOSE NEAS FROM BECOMING LOST. SIGNIFICANCE OF PROPOSED WORK: AT THE FIRST AND SECOND IAWN COMMITTEE MEETING, T. SPAHR REPORTED THAT DEDICATED GROUND BASED TELESCOPE FOLLOW-UP TO #tilde#V24 WAS NEEDED, ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE. THE CTIO 1.0-M TELESCOPE WILL BE THE FIRST TELESCOPE TO PROVIDE THAT CAPABILITY ON A FULLTIME BASIS. CURRENTLY THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII 2.24-M TELESCOPE OPERATED BY D. THOLEN HAS PROVIDED THE MAJORITY OF FOLLOW-UP AND RECOVERY OBSERVATIONS FAINTER THAN V23.0. HOWEVER, ONLY A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME EACH YEAR IS DEDICATED TO THOSE OBSERVATIONS. FROM 2015 OCTOBER 1ST THROUGH 2016 MARCH 1ST THERE WERE 4,540 MEASURES FAINTER THAN 22ND MAGNITUDE REPORTED TO THE MINOR PLANET CENTER AND ONLY 476 FAINTER THAN V23.0. CTIO S 1.0-M TELESCOPE WILL PRODUCE #tilde#2,000, V23.0-V24.0 MEASURES PER YEAR RESULTING IN A 300% INCREASE IN THESE FAINT NEO OBSERVATIONS."

SCIENTIFIC: THE SOUTHERN SKY NEAR EARTH OBSERVATIONS (SSNEO) BEGAN APRIL 1ST, 2012 AND HAS SINCE PROVIDED OVER 80% OF ALL NEA MEASURES BELOW MINUS 20 DECLINATION. THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE REMAINS A CRITICAL AREA FOR NEA FOLLOW-UP TO PREVENT MANY ASTEROIDS FROM BEING LOST BY EXTENDING THEIR ORBITAL ARCS. WITH THE INCREASE IN NEA DISCOVERIES FROM PANSTARRS AND THE CATALINA SKY SURVEY (CSS) THE NUMBER OF NEAR-EARTH OBJECT CONFIRMATION PAGE (NEOCP) NEAS IN NEED OF ASTROMETRY HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER. THEREFORE, SSNEO IN PHASE 3 WILL DEDICATE THEIR EFFORTS TO PROVIDE AN EFFICIENT NEA ASTROMETRY AND RECOVERY PROGRAM. PANSTARRS AND CSS ARE CURRENTLY EXPENDING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF TIME CONDUCTING FOLLOW-UP OF THEIR OWN DISCOVERIES LIMITING THEIR ABILITY TO SEARCH FOR NEW NEAR-EARTH ASTEROIDS. IN PHASE 3 SSNEO WILL DECREASE THE NEED FOR SURVEYS TO FOLLOW-UP THEIR SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE TARGETS BY 25%. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY UTILIZING NEW HARDWARE AND A SCHEDULING SYSTEM WHICH WILL OBTAIN EPHEMERIS AND UNCERTAINTY INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM JPL S NEASCOUT WEBSITE. TECHNICAL: IN 2015, SSNEO EXPANDED THEIR PROJECT FROM ONE 0.41-M TELESCOPE TO TWO 0.61-M TELESCOPES AND ONE 0.41-M INSTRUMENT INCREASING THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE FOLLOW-UP OF NEOS TO MAGNITUDE V23.0. THIS PROPOSAL WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE THREE TELESCOPES AND WILL REQUEST FUNDS TO UPGRADE THE REMAINING 0.41-M TELESCOPE TO A 0.61-M INSTRUMENT. WITH THIS UPGRADE ALL THREE TELESCOPES WILL BE IDENTICAL WITH THE SAME IMAGE SCALE AND 23.9 ARC-MINUTE FIELD OF VIEW. SINGLE OPPOSITION NEAS TYPICALLY HAVE AN UNCERTAINTY WHICH IS LINEAR WITHIN A RANGE OF RIGHT ASCENSION AND DECLINATION. TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF RECOVERIES THE THREE TELESCOPES WILL HAVE A NEW FEATURE WHERE EACH TELESCOPE S CAMERA ROTATOR WILL AUTOMATICALLY ORIENT ITS POSITION SO THAT THE SKY ANGLE OF UNCERTAINTY ALIGNS WITH THE CCD S ARRAY DIAGONALLY. BECAUSE EACH TELESCOPE HAS A DIAGONAL IMAGE THAT IS 33.8 ARC-MINUTES, ALL THREE TELESCOPES TOGETHER CAN COVER 5,100 ARC-SECONDS OF UNCERTAINTY WORKING TOGETHER. THIS ADDITIONAL FEATURE IN TELESCOPE AUTOMATION TAKES ADVANTAGE OF EACH TELESCOPE''S IDENTICAL PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, A 3 SQUARE DEGREE UNCERTAINTY REGION CAN BE EASILY SEARCHED IN A SINGLE NIGHT. THE JPL NEASCOUT WEBSITE IS A NEW ASSET THAT WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO DAILY OPERATIONS. USING NEASCOUT BOTH NEOCP AND NEA S EPHEMERIS AND UNCERTAINTY OF AN OBJECT CAN BE DIRECTLY LINKED INTO SSNEO S AUTOMATION ROUTINES. THIS WILL ALLOW CALCULATIONS OF THE FIELDS TO BE TARGETED SO THE UNCERTAINTY AREA CAN BE EASILY SEARCHED.

OUR GOAL IN CONTINUING THIS RESEARCH IS  TO PROVIDE A DEDICATED COST EFFECTIVE NEO FOLLOW UP PROGRAM THAT WILL ALLOW NASA TO COMPLETE THEIR GOAL OF CATALOGING POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS NEAR EARTH OBJECTS TO 100 METERS.ARI HAS BEEN AN INTEGRAL PART OF NASAS NEOO PROGRAM FOR THE PAST NINE YEARS. UTILIZING FOUR TELESCOPES LOCATED AT THE INSTITUTE, OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO PROVIDE THE LONGEST POSSIBLE ORBITAL ELEMENTS SPECIFICALLY FOR OBJECTS FAINTER THAN MAGNITUDE 22.0. THE PRINCIPAL GOAL OF THIS FACILITY IN PHASE IV WILL BE TO MEASURE MORE THAN 2,000 NEAS THAT ARE FAINTER THAN 22ND MAGNITUDE, IN ORDER TO MAKE THEIR FUTURE RECOVERY MUCH MORE PROBABLE DURING THE OBJECTS NEXT OPPOSITION.APPROACH AND METHODOLOGYARI WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON NEO CONFIRMATION PAGE OBJECTS AS A MAJOR PRIORITY. OUR SECONDARY GOAL IN THIS RESEARCH WILL BE TO CONDUCT FOLLOW UP OBSERVATIONS OF FIRST OPPOSITION NEOS AND THOSE REQUIRING ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS AS SPECIFIED BY THE MINOR PLANET CENTER MPC. ARIS LOWEST PRIORITY IN PHASE IV WILL BE TARGETED FOLLOW UP OF MULTIOPPOSITION OBJECTS.AS THE LARGE SKY SURVEYS SUCH AS PANSTARRS AND THE MT. LEMMON SURVEY CONTINUE TO MAKE NEW DISCOVERIES OF OBJECTS FAINTER THAN 22ND MAGNITUDE, THE NEED FOR FAINT FOLLOW UP BECOMES MORE IMPERATIVE. DURING PHASE IV, ARI PLANS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS ON NEAS BRIGHTER THAN 22ND MAGNITUDE DUE TO THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE OBSERVERS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON THESE NEOS. IN 2015, ONLY SIX OBSERVATORIES REPORTED MORE THAN 250, 22ND MAGNITUDE MEASURES OF NEOS TO THE MPC. OF THESE SIX, ARI WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR 47.5 OF ALL THE OBSERVATIONS THAT WERE FAINTER THAN MAGNITUDE 22.0. IN 2015, H21 CONFIRMED 513 NEOS FOR THE SKY SURVEY DISCOVERY TEAMS AND RECOVERED TWENTY FIVE 22ND MAGNITUDE FIRST OPPOSITION OBJECTS. THREE OF THE FOUR INSTRUMENTS CURRENTLY IN OPERATION AT THE INSTITUTE ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF 22ND MAGNITUDE NEO OBSERVATIONS AND THE 1.3 M TELESCOPE IS CAPABLE OF RECOVERING 23RD MAGNITUDE NEOS. SHORTLY AFTER COMMISSIONING THE 1.3 M TELESCOPE IN SEPTEMBER 2014, NEO 2010 SV3 WAS RECOVERED AT UNFILTERED MAGNITUDE 24.2 WITH THREE MEASURES. THREE WEEKS LATER IT WAS CONFIRMED A SECOND TIME WITH THREE ADDITIONAL MEASURES. DURING THIS TELESCOPES FIRST 18 MONTHS OF OPERATION MORE THAN 105, 23RD MAGNITUDE NEOS HAVE BEEN MEASURED.SIGNIFICANCE OF PROPOSED WORKOBSERVATIONS IN PHASE IV WILL BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN ONLY A FEW FOLLOW UP FACILITIES ARE AVAILABLE DUE TO THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S. ANNUAL MONSOON SEASON. IN 2015 THE INSTITUTE AT WESTFIELD, ILLINOIS WORKED 63 NIGHTS DURING THE SUMMER PRODUCING 10,202 NEO MEASURES AND CONFIRMING 170 NEWLY DISCOVERED OBJECTS FOR THE DISCOVERY TEAMS. IN ADDITION, H21 RECOVERED 163 NEOS THAT SUMMER FAINTER THAN MAGNITUDE 22.0.IN AN EFFORT TO STEP UP FAINT OBSERVATIONS, ARO WILL CLEARLY IMPACT NASAS NEO PROGRAM BY TARGETING AN ESTIMATED 2,000 NEAS FAINTER THAN MAGNITUDE 22.0 EACH YEAR. IN ADDITION, ARO ALSO PROJECTS THAT MORE THAN 250 INDIVIDUAL NEAS FAINTER THAN MAGNITUDE 23.0 WILL BE TARGETED EACH YEAR DURING THIS PHASE IV PROGRAM."

AND CAN THEY RISE UP TO BE RESEARCH COLLABORATORS? IN CREATING COSMOQUEST, WE STARTED WITH A CORE OF CITIZEN SCIENCE PORTALS, EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS FOR BOTH STUDENTS AND LIFELONG LEARNERS, AND COLLABORATION AREAS. THESE THREE PRIMARY FOCUSES MIRROR THE RESEARCH, COURSES, AND COLLABORATION SPACES THAT FORM THE FOUNDATION OF A UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENT. WE THEN WENT ON TO ADD THE FEATURES THAT MAKE A CENTER STANDOUT   WE ADDED SEMINARS IN THE FORM OF GOOGLE HANGOUTS ON AIR, PLANETARIUM CONTENT THROUGH OUR SCIENCE ON THE HALF SPHERE PROGRAM, AND EVEN THE CHANCE TO VICARIOUSLY ATTEND CONFERENCES THROUGH LIVE BLOGGING BY OUR TEAM MEMBERS.

WE WILL OBSERVE THE EVOLUTION OF THE PLUME OF WATER WITH LIDAR MEASUREMENTS FROM POKER FLAT RESEARCH RANGE PFRR. THE LIDAR IS CAPABLE OF TRACKING BOTH THE OPTICAL EMISSIONS FROM THE REGION AND MEASURING THE TEMPERATURE PROFILES. IN ADDITION, AN ADVANCED MESOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE MAPPER AMTM INSTRUMENT WILL BE DEPLOYED AT PFRR TO OBSERVE THE UPPER MESOSPHERE 87 KM BEFORE AND DURING THE WATER RELEASE TO PROVIDE QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION ON ANY DYNAMICS WAVE ACTIVITY AND CHANGES IN MESOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE. THE COMBINATION OF THE LIDAR AND MAPPING IMAGER THUS PROVIDES STRONG GROUND BASED DIAGNOSTICS FOR THE LAUNCH. THE LAUNCH WILL BE AT TWILIGHT SO THAT ANY FORMATION OF PMCS FROM THE PLUME WILL BE VISIBLE FROM THE GROUND. TRIMETHYL ALUMINUM TMA TRAILS WILL BE RELEASED IN ADDITION TO THE WATER FROM A SEPARATE PAYLOAD CANISTER.

THE CODE IS A COMPLETELY RESTRUCTURED AND MODERN VERSION OF THE RRTMG RADIATION CODE USED IN MANY GCMS. RRTMGP PRESERVES THE STRENGTHS OF THE EXISTING RRTMG PARAMETERIZATION, ESPECIALLY THE HIGH ACCURACY OF THE K-DISTRIBUTION TREATMENT OF ABSORPTION BY GASES, BUT THE ENTIRE CODE HAS BEEN REWRITTEN TO PROVIDE HIGHLY EFFICIENT COMPUTATION ACROSS A RANGE OF ARCHITECTURES.

NH3 ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO NITROGEN DEPOSITION; FLOW OF EXCESS NITROGEN IS ONE OF THE LARGEST THREATS TO BIOSPHERE INTEGRITY. AGRICULTURE IS THE LARGEST GLOBAL SOURCE OF NH3, AND BUT THERE ARE ALSO APPRECIABLE EMISSIONS OF NH3 FROM BIOMASS BURNING. HOWEVER, MAJOR UNCERTAINTIES EXIST IN NH3 EMISSION RATES FROM ALL SOURCES, AND ON ALL SCALES. THIS IS DUE TO SPARSE QUALITY IN SITU MEASUREMENTS. MEASUREMENTS FROM SATELLITE INSTRUMENTS PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR CAPTURING THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF NH3, ESPECIALLY OUTSIDE EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA, WHERE MONITORING NETWORKS RANGE FROM LIMITED TO NON-EXISTENT. THE NASA TROPOSPHERIC EMISSION SPECTROMETER (TES) WAS THE FIRST SATELLITE INSTRUMENT TO MEASURE NH3 FROM SPACE; TES CAPTURED SEASONAL VARIABILITY OVER LARGE REGIONS, AND DETECTED􀁊HOT SPOTS􀁊 OVER INDIA AND CHINA. TES ALSO REVEALED NH3 EMISSIONS FROM BIOMASS BURNING IN SOUTH AMERICA AND AFRICA, WHICH WERE ALSO OBSERVED BY THE METOP INFRARED ATMOSPHERIC SOUNDER INSTRUMENT (IASI) INSTRUMENT. NEW NH3 OBSERVATIONS FROM THE SNPP CROSS-TRACK INFRARED SOUNDER (CRIS) HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF NH3 DISTRIBUTIONS AND EMISSIONS BECAUSE CRIS HAS LOWER NOISE THAN IASI (0.04 K) AND SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER SPATIAL COVERAGE THAN TES. WHILE CRIS NH3 IS NOT YET AN OFFICIAL NASA PRODUCT, THE ALGORITHM WILL BECOME AN OPERATIONAL PRODUCT IN 2018. IT HAS ALREADY BEEN USED TO OBTAIN NH3 OVER CANADA, CALIFORNIA AND THE SOUTHEASTERN US, AS WELL AS OVER A NUMBER OF AERONET SITES. THESE DATA ARE CURRENTLY BEING VALIDATED AGAINST GROUND BASED FTIR AND AIRCRAFT NH3 MEASUREMENTS, AND HAVE PROVIDED INFORMATION ON THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF NH3 OVER THESE REGIONS. WE PROPOSE TO REFINE THE ALGORITHM WITH SOME CONTINUED VALIDATION AND TO DEMONSTRATE THE UTILITY OF THE CRIS NH3 DATA BY APPLYING SOME NOVEL APPROACHES TO OBTAIN EMISSION ESTIMATES AND SOURCE LOCATIONS. WE WILL: A) USE A TESSELLATION TECHNIQUE TO EXTRACT SUB-PIXEL INFORMATION FROM REPEATED CRIS OVERPASSES. THIS WILL PROVIDE MORE PRECISE LOCATIONS OF SOURCES OF HIGH NH3 EMISSIONS. B) USE AN IMAGE ROTATION APPROACH BASED ON PREVAILING WIND DIRECTION TO CREATE COMPOSITE IMAGES OF REGIONS WITH FIRES, CONFINED ANIMAL FEEDLOT OPERATIONS (CAFOS), OR OTHER INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE, AS WELL OVER SELECTED LARGE URBAN AREAS (LOS ANGELES). THESE IMAGES CAN BE USED TO COMPUTE NH3 FLUX DENSITY FROM THE AREAS OF INTEREST, WHICH CAN THEN BE USED TO ESTIMATE EMISSIONS.

IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL: (1) INTEGRATE THE NASA CRIS NH3 RETRIEVED PRODUCT AND OUR CMAQ-BASED INVERSION METHODOLOGY INTO A PROTOTYPE APPLICATION SYSTEM ON THE AMAZON CLOUD (ARL 4) (2) DEVELOP MODEL-READY UPDATED NH3 EMISSION FILES FOR CMAQ, CAMX, AND GEM-MACH AND BETA-TEST THEM IN THE END-USER APPLICATIONS (ARL 5) (3) DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PROTOTYPE APPLICATION IMPROVES THE SIMULATION OF NH3 AND INORGANIC PM2.5 IN END-USER MODELING AND LEADS TO BETTER DECISION MAKING (ARL 6) (4) FULLY INTEGRATE THE PROTOTYPE APPLICATION INTO END-USER DECISION-MAKING (ARL 7) WE WILL DESIGN OUR APPLICATION SO THAT THE EMISSION FILES CAN BE EASILY INCORPORATED INTO EXISTING MODELING ACTIVITIES BY GOVERNMENT AIR QUALITY MANAGERS (SUCH AS US EPA, THE CENTRAL STATES AIR RESOURCE AGENCIES, THE WESTERN REGIONAL AIR PARTNERSHIP, AND ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE CANADA), AIR QUALITY FORECASTERS (INCLUDING THE NOAA NATIONAL AIR QUALITY FORECAST CAPABILITY RESEARCH TEAM), AND INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS (SUCH AS THE MEMBERS OF THE ELECTRIC POWER RESEARCH INSTITUTE). THESE FILES WILL BE PRODUCED VIA A CLOUD COMPUTING SYSTEM THAT BOTH AER AND END USERS WILL BE ABLE TO OPERATE AFTER NASA FUNDING ENDS. THE APPLICATION CODE WILL ALSO BE PROVIDED TO END USERS FOR THEIR OWN USE. AS NEW CRIS INSTRUMENTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE LAUNCHED OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES, OUR PROPOSED APPLICATION WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE EMISSIONS OF NH3 TO DECISION-MAKERS FOR MANY YEARS INTO THE FUTURE. OUR PROJECT TEAM HAS A RECORD OF PROVEN PERFORMANCE ON ALL ASPECTS OF THIS PROJECT, INCLUDING SATELLITE RETRIEVALS OF NH3, INVERSION MODELING TO IMPROVE EMISSION INVENTORIES, AND DEVELOPING CLOUD-BASED SCIENTIFIC SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS.

HERE, WE PROPOSE TO QUANTIFY URBAN BIOGENIC CO2 FLUXES IN THE LOS ANGELES (LA) BASIN FOR A TOTAL OF 3 YEARS TO DISENTANGLE ANTHROPOGENIC VS BIOGENIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO URBAN CARBON CYCLING AND ATMOSPHERIC CO2 ENHANCEMENTS. A PRIMARY OUTCOME WILL BE A GENERALIZED MODEL-OBSERVATION FRAMEWORK TO STUDY GLOBAL URBAN CO2 SOURCE AND SINK PROCESSES, DRIVEN BY REMOTE SENSING OBSERVATIONS OF SOLAR INDUCED CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE (SIF) FROM NASA OCO-2, OCO-3, AND GEOCARB MISSIONS. OUR STRATEGY LEVERAGES THE DENSE SIF REMOTE SENSING OBSERVING NETWORK IN LA TO CONSTRAIN DIURNAL, SPATIAL AND SEASONAL VARIABILITY IN PHOTOSYNTHETIC ACTIVITY ACROSS DIVERSE URBAN AND NATURAL LANDSCAPES IN LA, AND FEEDS THIS INFORMATION INTO A NEW URBAN LIGHT USE EFFICIENCY MODEL, THE URBAN VEGETATION PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND RESPIRATION MODEL (URBANVPRM), TO ESTIMATE GROSS AND NET BIOSPHERE CO2 FLUX. SIF OBSERVATIONS FROM OCO-2 AND EXPECTED FROM OCO-3 WILL PROVIDE SMALL FOOTPRINT (3 KM2) AND HIGH DATA ACQUISITION NEEDED TO RESOLVE LANDSCAPE SCALE PROCESSES, WITH OCO-3 PROVIDING THE ADDED BENEFIT OF HIGH RESOLUTION SPATIAL MAPPING AND DIURNAL ACQUISITION OVER CITIES SIMILAR TO EXPECTED GEOCARB MAPPING ABILITIES. TO OPTIMIZE INFORMATION CONTENT OF OCO-2 AND OCO-3, WE WILL USE DIURNALLY INTEGRATED AND SPATIALLY EXPLICIT HYPERSPECTRAL MEASUREMENTS FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABORATORY FOR ATMOSPHERIC REMOTE SENSING FOURIER TRANSFORM SPECTROMETER (CLARS-FTS) ON MT WILSON (SITTING ABOVE LA) TO CALIBRATE AND SCALE OCO-2/OCO-3 SIF OVERPASSES ACROSS THE LA BASIN, TO BETTER CHARACTERIZE SATELLITE DERIVED DAILY INTEGRATED SIF VARIABILITY ACROSS DIVERSE NATURAL AND URBAN ECOSYSTEMS. WE WILL MAP CLARS, OCO-2 AND OCO-3 SIF ONTO A SPATIALLY CONTINUOUS GRID USING DATA FUSION WITH LANDSAT 8 EVI, AND INTEGRATE INTO URBANVPRM TO PREDICT DIURNAL, SEASONAL, AND INTERANNUAL PHOTOSYNTHETIC, RESPIRATION, NET CO2 FLUXES IN LA. FINALLY, WE WILL USE WRF-STILT FOOTPRINT ANALYSIS TO PREDICT CO2 SIGNALS IN COMPARISON TO ONGOING, HOURLY CO2 OBSERVATIONS FROM THE LA IN SITU GHG TOWER NETWORK, ACCOUNTING FOR BIOGENIC (URBANVPRM) AND FOSSIL (FROM HESTIA) URBAN SOURCES. OUR PROPOSAL IS CAPTURED IN 3 OBJECTIVES: OBJECTIVE 1: DELIVER CALIBRATED, GAP-FILLED, AND SPATIOTEMPORALLY INTEGRATED PHOTOSYNTHESIS INDEX OVER LA. OBJECTIVE 2: QUANTIFY URBAN BIOGENIC CO2 FLUXES OVER THE LA MEGACITY, AND RANK URBAN VEGETATION TYPES IN TERMS OF ABILITY TO STORE CARBON AND MITIGATE ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS IN COMPARISON TO FOSSIL FUEL INVENTORIES. OBJECTIVE 3: VALIDATE AND ATTRIBUTE DOMINATE FOSSIL FUEL AND BIOGENIC CO2 FLUXES AGAINST TOWER IN SITU CO2 AND 14CO2 DATA. THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE A TIMELY FRAMEWORK TO INGEST THE LARGER SET OF ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS OBSERVATIONS (GEDI, HISUI, AND ECOSTRESS) EXPECTED FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION STARTING IN 2018, AND AN IMPORTANT TEST CASE TO INGEST HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION SIF DATA FROM GEOCARB IN LEVEL 3 AND 4 MODEL ENHANCED C PRODUCTS.

THIS INFORMATION WILL BE USED BY MILITARY STAKEHOLDERS TO HELP PREVENT AND CONTAIN CONFLICT THAT MAY ARISE BECAUSE OF DROUGHT INDUCED FOOD SHORTAGES AND/OR FOOD PRICE SHOCKS.

OUR FIRST OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP A GLOBAL FLASH DROUGHT CLIMATOLOGY THAT WILL BE USED TO INFORM STAKEHOLDERS OF HISTORICAL HOT SPOTS. WE WILL ACCOMPLISH THIS USING THE NASA MERRA-2 DATASET CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT STATE OF THE SCIENCE FOCUSED ON EVAPORATIVE STRESS IN VEGETATION.

OUR THIRD OBJECTIVE IS TO USE EXISTING MONITORING AND FORECASTING ASSETS TO PROVIDE A RISK ASSESSMENT OF FLASH DROUGHT INTENSIFICATION OVER SUB-SEASONAL TO SEASONAL TIME SCALES USING A HYBRID STATISTICAL APPROACH. WE CONTEND THAT DROUGHTS ARE OF CRITICAL AND INCREASING SIGNIFICANCE FROM A UNITED STATES NATIONAL SECURITY PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE THEIR IMPACTS ARE SIGNIFICANT FROM A FOOD SECURITY PERSPECTIVE. A CONTEMPORARY EXAMPLE OF DROUGHT INDUCED CONFLICT IS THE ONGOING CONFLICT IN SYRIA. THE PROJECT WE HAVE PROPOSED WILL GIVE OUR MILITARY STAKEHOLDERS DECISION-SUPPORT INFORMATION ABOUT DROUGHT IN THE PROPER TEMPORAL CONTEXT(S). INTELLIGENCE DERIVED FROM OUR PROJECT WILL BE USED TO HELP MITIGATE OR PREVENT CONFLICT THAT MAY ARISE (DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY) FROM DROUGHT INDUCED CROP LOSSES OR CROP FAILURES. THEREFORE, THE CONNECTION BETWEEN DROUGHT AND FOOD SECURITY IS PALPABLE AND OF INCREASING IMPORTANCE.

THIS RISK IS GEOGRAPHICALLY VARIABLE, AS BOTH THE RATE OF SLR AND SOCIOECONOMIC EXPOSURE VARY WITH LOCATION.  BECAUSE REGIONAL SEA LEVEL IS A VALUABLE TOOL FOR UNDERSTANDING AND MONITORING CLIMATE, AND BECAUSE OF ITS ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS, MANY RECENT GOVERNMENT REPORTS HAVE UNDERSCORED THE NEED FOR A STANDARDIZED SET OF REGIONAL SEA LEVEL INDICATORS.

SMALL ASTEROIDS ARE USUALLY IRREGULARLY SHAPED, AND THE TOTAL FORCE INDUCES A TORQUE ON THEM AND THUS CHANGES THEIR SPIN CONDITIONS. THIS EFFECT, A SO-CALLED YORP EFFECT, IS ONE OF THE CRITICAL ELEMENTS THAT HAVE GENERATED THE CURRENTLY OBSERVED POPULATION OF ASTEROIDS IN THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE YORP EFFECT CAN SPIN THESE ASTEROIDS UP TO THEIR SPIN LIMITS AND CHANGE THEIR SHAPE CONFIGURATIONS. BECAUSE THE YORP EFFECT IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE SHAPES AND MATERIAL CONDITIONS, SUCH DEFORMATION PROCESSES MAY CAUSE THE YORP EFFECT TO BEHAVE STOCHASTICALLY [COTTO-FIGUEROA ET AL., APJ 2015]. HOWEVER, RECENT WORKS POINTED OUT THAT DETAILED ANALYSES WOULD BE ABLE TO REMOVE THE STOCHASTIC TREND OF THE YORP EFFECT AND PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DYNAMICAL AND STRUCTURAL EVOLUTION OF SMALL ASTEROIDS [E.G., MCMAHON, DPS 2017]. IN THIS PROJECT, WE QUANTIFY THE EVOLUTION OF THE YORP-DRIVEN ROTATIONAL ACCELERATION AND SHAPE DEFORMATION OF IRREGULARLY SHAPED ASTEROIDS. WE APPROACH THIS ISSUE BY USING A PLASTIC FINITE ELEMENT MODEL (FEM) TECHNIQUE, A SOFT-SPHERE DISCRETE ELEMENT METHOD (SSDEM), AND A YORP-COEFFICIENT COMPUTATION TECHNIQUE. TO QUANTIFY DETAILED INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE YORP EFFECT AND SHAPE DEFORMATION, WE WILL APPLY AN EFFICIENT SCHEME IN WHICH THE MEMBERS CAN WORK SEPARATELY. THIS PROJECT WILL USE TWO KEY PHYSICAL PARAMETERS THAT DESCRIBE COHESION OF GEOLOGICAL MATERIALS AND SURFACE MODIFICATION TO CHARACTERIZE THE YORP-DRIVEN SPIN-UP. USING FOUR PUBLICLY AVAILABLE POLYHEDRON SHAPE MODELS, WE ANALYZE THEIR REALISTIC EVOLUTION PROCESSES TO PROVIDE A QUANTITATIVE FRAMEWORK AND CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE YORP EVOLUTION OF SMALL ASTEROIDS. THE ANSWERS DERIVED IN THIS PROJECT SHED LIGHT ON THE STRUCTURAL AND ORBITAL EVOLUTION OF SMALL ASTEROIDS, GIVING CRITICAL HINTS ON THE ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

AURORAL EMISSION FROM ELECTRON IMPACT PROCESSES CAN PROVIDE A REMOTE WINDOW ON THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF PLASMA AND NEUTRAL GASES SURROUNDING SMALL BODIES (GALAND&CHAKRABARTI, 2002; ROTH ET AL. 2014). SURPRISINGLY, ROSETTA FOUND THAT OUTSIDE 2 AU PRE-PERIHELION, ATOMIC AND MOLECULAR EMISSION FEATURES IN THE INNER COMA WERE PREDOMINANTLY CAUSED BY DISSOCIATIVE ELECTRON IMPACT EXCITATION (FELDMAN ET AL. 2015). WHEN THE COMET CAME WITHIN 2 AU OF THE SUN, FLUORESCENT EMISSION BECAME THE DOMINANT PROCESS, AS WATER DENSITIES IN THE INNER COMA COULD EFFECTIVELY COOL THE ELECTRON POPULATION BELOW THE THRESHOLD ENERGY OF THE RELEVANT ELECTRON IMPACT DISSOCIATIVE EXCITATION PROCESSES (BODEWITS ET AL. 2016). THE COMET WAS ALSO SUBJECTED TO SOLAR TRANSIENT EVENTS THAT INCREASED ATOMIC EMISSION FEATURES, A PROCESS WITH IMPLICATIONS ON THE CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE COMA THAT ARE NOT YET FULLY UNDERSTOOD (EDBERG ET AL. 2016, NOONAN ET AL. 2018). FURTHER QUANTITATIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE ALICE AND OSIRIS IMAGES OF THE COMA HAS BEEN HAMPERED BY LIMITED LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS OF EXCITATION CROSS SECTIONS FOR ELECTRON IMPACT REACTIONS WITH THE GASES PRESENT IN COMETARY COMAE. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE EMISSION OBSERVED BY ALICE AND OSIRIS, IT IS NECESSARY TO CORRELATE THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE NEUTRAL GAS AND ELECTRONS IN THE COMA. METHODOLOGY WE WILL COMBINE AND CORRELATE IN-SITU MEASUREMENTS OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ELECTRON POPULATION BY THE RPC INSTRUMENTS WITH THE TEMPERATURES OF WATER, WITH DETAILED EMISSION MAPS OF FRAGMENT SPECIES (OH, OH+, OI, CI ..) ACQUIRED BY ALICE AND OSIRIS. WHEN THE COMET APPROACHED THE SUN ITS PRODUCTION RATES (AND THUS LOCAL DENSITIES OF SPECIES) INCREASED BY TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDES, PROVIDING US WITH A WIDE SAMPLE OF PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS. FURTHERMORE, THE COMA EXPERIENCED MULTIPLE SHORT-LIVED EVENTS THAT PROVIDE NATURAL LABORATORIES TO STUDY PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROCESSES IN THE COMA, SUCH AS COMET OUTBURSTS (TEMPORAL ENHANCEMENT OF LOCAL DENSITY), CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS AND CO-ROTATING INTERACTION REGIONS (SOLAR WIND INTENSITY, ELECTRON DENSITY AND TEMPERATURE INCREASE), AND SOLAR FLARES (INCREASED HIGH ENERGY EMISSION FROM THE SUN). WE WILL USE THESE EVENTS AS NATURAL LABORATORIES TO STUDY HOW PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AFFECT THE COMPOSITION AND CHEMISTRY IN THE COMA. FINALLY, TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE EMISSION OF FRAGMENT SPECIES SEEN BY OSIRIS AND ALICE ARE RELATED TO THE PARENT MOLECULES (AS SEEN BY MIRO) WE WILL CONTINUE TO CONDUCT ELECTRON IMPACT EXPERIMENTS ON ABUNDANT COMA MOLECULES SUCH AS H2O, CO2, O2, AND CO IN THE LAB. RELEVANCE OUR PROPOSAL IS DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THE RDAP PROGRAM AS WE WILL ENHANCE THE SCIENTIFIC RETURN OF ROSETTA MISSION BY PLACING SEVERAL INSTRUMENTS  OBSERVATIONS AND DATASETS (MEASURED BRIGHTNESSES, ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS, AND DENSITIES) INTO CONTEXT WITH IDENTIFIED COMA PROCESSES.

OUR INNOVATIVE APPROACH IS TO COMBINE THE RETROSPECTIVE METHOD (USE HISTORICAL TMIS AND DELAYS ON SIMILAR DAYS FOR NEXT-DAY PREDICTION) WITH THE PREDICTIVE METHOD (USE FAST-TIME SIMULATION OF NEXT-DAY S WEATHER, TMIS AND RESULTING DELAYS, BASED ON THE TRANSLATED WEATHER FORECAST) INTO A SEAMLESS ENSEMBLE. UNTIL NOW, ONLY THE FIRST PART   HISTORICAL ANALYSIS   WAS USED FOR SUCH PREDICTIONS, AND EVEN THEN MOSTLY SHORT-RANGE. HOWEVER, AVMET HAS DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED A POWERFUL WEATHER-AWARE, SUPERFAST-TIME NAS SIMULATOR, DART, WHICH CAN REPRODUCE HISTORICALLY OBSERVED OUTCOMES OF A WIDE RANGE OF WEATHER-IMPACTED DAYS WITH A GOOD DEGREE OF ACCURACY AND PROCESS A COMPLEX DAY OF NAS OPERATIONS IN JUST OVER A MINUTE. OUR TECHNOLOGY ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AUTOMATE AND ACCELERATE SIMILAR-WEATHER SEARCHES. THIS OPENS THE DOOR TO AN ENSEMBLE APPROACH WHERE BOTH HISTORICAL AND SIMULATION-DRIVEN FORECASTING METHODS ARE COMBINED FOR NEXT-DAY DELAY PREDICTION AND TMI RECOMMENDATIONS. THE METHODOLOGY WILL BE DESIGNED AS A FULLY AUTOMATED TOOLCHAIN TO WORK YEAR-ROUND, PROCESSING CONVECTIVE AS WELL AS NON-CONVECTIVE (CEILINGS, WINTER WEATHER, WIND, ETC.) WEATHER IMPACTS. IT WILL USE A NUMBER OF INNOVATIVE WEATHER FORECAST TRANSLATION, TMI SIMULATION, AND ENSEMBLING TECHNIQUES. IT WILL ALSO USE NEW AND CREATIVE RANDOMIZATION METHODS TO GENERATE A RANGE OF POTENTIAL SCENARIOS BASED ON NEXT-DAY WEATHER FORECAST. WE BELIEVE THAT, BY TUNING THE BLEND OF RETROSPECTIVE AND PREDICTIVE ENSEMBLE METHODS, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THEIR STRENGTHS AND MITIGATE THEIR SHORTCOMINGS, AND DEMONSTRATE NOTICEABLY BETTER PREDICTIVE ACCURACY OF THIS AMALGAMATED ENSEMBLE VS.

OUR CONCEPT EXPLOITS DOUBLY FED GENERATOR TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS RECEIVED CONSIDERABLE DEVELOPMENT FOR WIND ENERGY APPLICATIONS AND ADAPTS IT TO THE AIRCRAFT ELECTRIC PROPULSOR APPLICATION. IN PARTICULAR, THE WIND APPLICATION IS LOW FREQUENCY, LOW SPEED, 600V, FIXED FREQUENCY, MW CLASS, SLIP-RING OR BRUSHLESS DOUBLY FED GENERATOR TECHNOLOGY. OUR PROPOSED EFFORT ADAPTS THAT TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP HIGHER VOLTAGE (1KV), VARIABLE FREQUENCY, HIGH SPEED AIRCRAFT ELECTRIC BRUSHLESS DOUBLY FED MOTORS (BDFM) FOR THE ADVANCED PROPULSOR APPLICATION. IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES OF OUR PROPULSOR TECHNICAL SOLUTION, OUR TEAM AND OUR PROGRAM PLAN ARE: 1. OUR DUAL FED MOTOR CONCEPT IS BRUSHLESS, WHICH WAS IDENTIFIED AS HIGHLY IMPORTANT BY AIRCRAFT OEM/INTEGRATORS WHEN BRIEFED ON OUR APPROACH. 2.

THE TRANSDISCIPLINARY BATTELLE TEAM IS ESPECIALLY QUALIFIED TO MANAGE AND IMPLEMENT THIS WORK IN A COST EFFECTIVE AND TECHNICALLY INNOVATIVE WAY. ENERGY SYSTEMS ARE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, WITH ELECTRICITY SERVING SOCIETY FROM COOKING AND LIGHTING TO COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORTATION. HOWEVER, IMPACTS FROM CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND CHANGE, SUCH AS EXTREME WEATHER OR SEA LEVEL RISE, THREATEN ENERGY RELIABILITY AND COMMUNITY RESILIENCE. HOWEVER, VULNERABILITIES AND NEEDS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR VARY WIDELY BY COMPONENT, REGION, AND GEOGRAPHY. A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY FOR ADDRESSING RESILIENCE PLANNING AND UPTAKE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY MUST INCLUDE ENGAGEMENT WITH UTILITY PROVIDERS WHO CAN BUILD SUCH ACTIONS INTO ROUTINE PLANNING AND MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES. FINDINGS FROM THE 2016 ENERGY MANAGEMENT WORKSHOP SUGGEST THAT THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN EARTH SCIENCE RESEARCHERS AND UTILITY END USERS MUST BE STRENGTHENED FOR NEW PRODUCTS, TOOLS, AND DATA PACKAGES TO MEET UTILITY USER NEEDS. THE BATTELLE TEAM WILL ENGAGE THE EARTH SCIENCE COMMUNITY, UTILITY END USERS, AND OTHER GOVERNMENT OR RESEARCH STAKEHOLDERS IN STRENGTHENING THE ABILITY OF UTILITY END USERS TO ACCESS AND USE EO DATA. THE PROPOSED APPROACH UTILIZES A CAPACITY BUILDING FRAMEWORK TO CONDUCT A THOROUGH NEEDS ASSESSMENT, UTILIZING THE UTILITY PARTNERSHIP AS A KEY ENTRY POINT TO ENGAGING WITH THE END USER COMMUNITY. AN ADVISORY GROUP OF TECHNICAL EXPERTS AND FEDERAL AGENCY REPRESENTATIVES WILL ALSO BE FORMED TO MAXIMIZE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT WILL SEEK TO QUANTIFY TECHNICAL CAPACITY AND GAPS, CURRENT EO DATA USAGE, AND ASPIRATIONAL GOALS ON POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM APPLICATION AREAS FOR EO UPTAKE. BASED ON THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT FINDINGS, A SERIES OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CAPACITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES WILL BE DEVELOPED. PRELIMINARY TRAINING TOPICS MAY INCLUDE SATELLITE DATA TYPES AND CURRENT APPLICATIONS FOR UTILITY APPLICATIONS; DATA PROCESSING, FORMATTING, AND VISUALIZATION FOR UTILITY APPLICATIONS; OR INCORPORATING EO DATA AND TOOLS INTO RESILIENCE PLANNING OR RENEWABLE ENERGY UPTAKE (ASSESSMENT, MONITORING, ETC.) FOR UTILITY APPLICATIONS. CASE STUDIES ON CURRENT AND ASPIRATIONAL EO APPLICATIONS OR EXISTING TOOLS AND PRODUCTS WILL BE DEVELOPED USING INFOGRAPHICS AND/ OR ESRI STORY MAPS AND DISTRIBUTED THROUGH TARGETED LISTSERVS AND SOCIAL MEDIA. A PRELIMINARY CASE STUDY TOPIC MAY INCLUDE USING NORMALIZED DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX (NDVI) FROM VIIRS AND MODIS, PRECIPITATION DATA FROM GPM AND SOIL MOISTURE DATA FROM SMAP DATA TO UNDERSTAND FLOOD RISK. THE BATTELLE TEAM WILL ALSO ENGAGE WITH THE EARTH SCIENCE COMMUNITY VIA PARTICIPATION IN TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND THROUGH THE DISTRIBUTION OF UTILITY DATA NEEDS VIA PUBLICATION IN KEY SCIENTIFIC AND POPULAR JOURNALS. GREATER INFORMATION SHARING NETWORKS ARE AN IMPORTANT STEP IN PROVIDING AND STRENGTHENING LINKAGES BETWEEN DATA PROVIDERS AND DATA USERS. THE PROPOSED WORK MEETS THE GROUP ON EARTH OBSERVATIONS  (GEO) STATED NEED TO IMPROVE THE AVAILABILITY, ACCESS, AND USE OF EOS TO INFORM DECISIONS AND BENEFIT SOCIETY. THE ATTENTION PAID TO SUSTAINED STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT, ONGOING EVALUATION, AND INFORMATION SHARING WITH BOTH SCIENTIFIC AND END-USER COMMUNITIES ALSO SUPPORTS GEO VISION FOR ENERGY (GEOVENER) BY CONTRIBUTING TO A PROCESS THAT IS BETTER-INFORMED TO SUPPORT END-TO-END PRODUCTION SYSTEMS AND RESULTS IN ACTIONABLE MEASURES TO ADDRESS CRITICAL GLOBAL AND REGIONAL CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES IN ENERGY SERVICES."

LONG TERM HUMAN MISSIONS REQUIRE SUSTAINED CREW HEALTH AND SAFETY. A RESEARCH AREA THAT IS IMPORTANT IN SUSTAINING CREW HEALTH IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF IMPROVED SPACEFLIGHT-SUITABLE METHODS FOR MICROBIOLOGICAL MONITORING, AS WELL AS CONTAMINATION CONTROL AND REDUCTION. THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS) IS A CONFINED AND ISOLATED HABITAT IN AN EXTREME, HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT. THE HUMAN AND HABITAT MICROFLORA VARIES IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ABOARD THE ISS. CHANGES IN THE MICROFLORA MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED HEALTH RISK FOR THE CREW. MICROORGANISMS INCLUDING MICROBIAL BIOFILMS HAVE BEEN FOUND ON VARIOUS HABITAT SURFACES, INSIDE THE AIR AND WATER HANDLING SYSTEMS AS WELL AS THE HARDWARE USED ON THE ISS. BIOFILMS ARE KNOWN TO CAUSE DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT FROM POLYMER DETERIORATION, METAL CORROSION AND BIO-FOULING. THE PRIMARY CONCERN REGARDING CREW HEALTH IS CHARACTERIZED BY ACTIVITY OF OPPORTUNISTIC PATHOGENIC MICROORGANISMS THAT HAVE BEEN NOTED TO ACCUMULATE IN THE CLOSED ENVIRONMENTS OF THE ISS AND OTHER SPACECRAFT ON LONG-DURATION MISSIONS. UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECTS OF THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT, ESPECIALLY ALTERED GRAVITY, ON MICROBIAL BIOFILMS IS CRUCIAL FOR THE SUCCESS OF LONG-TERM HUMAN SPACE MISSIONS. SURFACE-ASSOCIATED BIOFILM COMMUNITIES WERE ABUNDANT ON THE MIR SPACE STATION AND CONTINUE TO BE A CHALLENGE ON THE ISS. THE HEALTH AND SAFETY HAZARDS LINKED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIOFILMS ARE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN DUE TO THE SUPPRESSION OF HUMAN IMMUNE FUNCTION OBSERVED DURING SPACEFLIGHT. VARIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CERTAIN METALS REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CONTACT-MEDIATED MICROBIAL INFECTIONS. ANTIMICROBIAL SURFACES ARE DEFINED AS MATERIALS THAT CONTAIN AN ANTIMICROBIAL AGENT SUCH AS SILVER, COPPER AND THEIR ALLOYS THAT INHIBITS OR REDUCES THE ABILITY OF MICROORGANISMS TO GROW ON THE SURFACE OF A MATERIAL. ANTIMICROBIAL SURFACES ARE FUNCTIONALIZED IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PROCESSES. THE INTRODUCTION OF ANTIMICROBIAL SURFACES FOR MEDICAL, PHARMACEUTICAL AND INDUSTRIAL PURPOSES HAS SHOWN THEIR UNIQUE POTENTIAL FOR REDUCING AND PREVENTING MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION. THE CONTACT KILLING OF SEVERAL TYPES OF MICROORGANISMS BY COPPER HAS BEEN ASSESSED IN MULTIPLE LABORATORY INVITRO STUDIES. FOR SUSTAINED CREW HEALTH AND SAFETY ADDITIONAL STUDIES ON THE MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN THE FORMATION OF MICROBIAL BIOFILMS AND THEIR EFFICIENT DESTRUCTION UNDER SPACEFLIGHT CONDITIONS, I.E., LONG-TERM GROWTH AND ADAPTATION TO LOW GRAVITY ENVIRONMENTS, ARE NEEDED. THE HYPOTHESIS TO BE TESTED BY METALLICA IS THAT SURFACES CONTAINING COPPER AND/OR SILVER WILL INHIBIT BIOFILM FORMATION UNDER ALTERED GRAVITY REGIMES TO A LESSER EXTENT THAN IN 1 X G DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE INTERACTION WITH THE METAL IONS ON THE SURFACE IS SLOWER BECAUSE THEIR MOVEMENT AROUND THE CELL IS RESTRICTED TO DIFFUSION. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT AND THE RATE, IF ANY, OF COPPER AND/OR SILVER SURFACES ON MICROBIAL GROWTH RATE, TOTAL BIOMASS ACCUMULATION, AND BIOFILM FORMATION. THE GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A CONCEPTUAL MODEL DESCRIBING THE AFFECT OF MICRO-GRAVITY ON BIOFILM FORMATION GROWN ON NON-INHIBITING SURFACES AS WELL AS ON METAL SURFACES THAT ARE POTENTIAL BIOFILM GROWTH INHIBITORS. THE APPROACH WILL BE TO TEST THREE DIFFERENT MICROBIAL MODEL SYSTEMS (I.E., ESCHERICHIA COLI K12, A STAPHYLOCOCCUS SP. ISOLATE FROM THE ISS, AND THE HEAVY METAL RESISTANT STRAIN CUPRIAVIDUS METALLIDURANS CH34) FOR BIOFILM FORMATION ON VARIOUS COPPER- AND SILVER-SURFACES, AS WELL AS INERT SURFACES AS CONTROLS. THESE SURFACES DIFFER IN THEIR ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY BASED ON CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND/OR GEOMETRIC NANOSTRUCTURES. THESE SURFACES WILL BE TESTED FOR BIOFILM FORMATION RATES UNDER DIFFERENT SPACEFLIGHT RELEVANT GRAVITATIONAL REGIMES (E.G., MOON 0.16 X G, MARS 0.38 X G, G ISS AND 1 X G CONTROL). MICROBIAL GROWTH WILL OCCUR UNDER OPTIMAL BIOFILM-INDUCING CON"

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

THE NORTH AMERICAN MONSOON ANTICYCLONE (NAMA) DOMINATES THE CIRCULATION OF THE NORTH-WESTERN HEMISPHERE AND ACTS TO PARTIALLY CONFINE AND ISOLATE AIR FROM THE SURROUNDING ATMOSPHERE. STRONG CONVECTIVE STORMS IN THE NAMA REGULARLY PENETRATE DEEP INTO THE LOWER STRATOSPHERE LS. THE UNIQUENESS OF THE NAMA REGION IS MOST EASILY SEEN IN SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS OF WATER VAPOR, WHICH SHOW A LARGE ENHANCEMENT IN THE LS OVER NORTH AMERICA NOT SEEN EITHER IN MAGNITUDE OR AT SUCH HIGH LATITUDES ELSEWHERE AROUND THE GLOBE. BUT THE COUPLING OF TROPOPAUSE-PENETRATING CONVECTION WITH LARGE-SCALE MONSOONAL MOTION IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD, AS IS THE IMPACT OF CONVECTION ON THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE LS, BOTH IN MONSOON REGIONS AND IN THE GLOBAL STRATOSPHERE, WHICH RECEIVES INPUTS OF MOIST AND POLLUTED MONSOON AIR FROM THE NAMA.

A MAJOR DIFFICULTY IN SIMULATING EARTH S CLIMATE SYSTEM IS THAT THERE ARE INTERACTIONS ACROSS SCALES, SO THAT THE LARGE TIME AND SPACE SCALES CAN BE SENSITIVE TO PROCESSES ON SMALL SCALES. AS THE COMPUTATIONAL RESOLUTION OF GLOBAL OCEAN MODELS HAS IMPROVED, SCIENTISTS HAVE BEGUN TO SUSPECT THAT KILOMETER-SCALE EDDIES AND FRONTS, CALLED  SUBMESOSCALE  VARIABILITY, HAVE A NET EFFECT ON OCEAN-ATMOSPHERE HEAT EXCHANGE THAT IS LARGER THAN THE HEATING FROM THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT.

THE LACK OF INSIGHT INTO CHROMOSPHERIC ENERGETICS IS IN PART BECAUSE IT IS A HIGHLY DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPLEX REGION WITH VARIOUS PHYSICAL PROCESSES PLAYING AN IMPORTANT ROLE: RADIATIVE TRANSFER, SCATTERING, TIME DEPENDENT PARTIAL IONIZATION EFFECTS, ION-NEUTRAL INTERACTION EFFECTS (INIE), SUCH AS AMBIPOLAR DIFFUSION AND THE HALL TERM, AND THERMAL CONDUCTION ALONG THE MAGNETIC FIELD, WHICH IS IMPORTANT IN THE UPPER CHROMOSPHERE, TRANSITION REGION (TR), AND CORONA.

IN FACT, SURFACE RADIATIVE FLUX (SRF) ESTIMATIONS FROM SATELLITES (E.G. CERES) RELY HEAVILY ON MODELED FIELDS OF TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY, SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS AND CLOUDS.

PRELIMINARY WORK SHOWS THAT THE DIVISION BETWEEN SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES AND EXOPLANETS WITH AND WITHOUT ATMOSPHERES FOLLOW TRENDS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY CONSISTENT WITH TWO DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERIC ESCAPE PROCESSES. THE TWO MECHANISMS ARE IMPACT EROSION, WHEN GASES ARE LOST AS A RESULT OF LARGE BODY IMPACTS, AND HYDRODYNAMIC ESCAPE, WHEN ATMOSPHERES EXPAND AND ESCAPE BECAUSE OF HEATING BY STELLAR IRRADIATION. DATA SUGGEST THAT IMPACT EROSION OBLITERATES ATMOSPHERES WHEN MEDIAN IMPACT VELOCITIES EXCEED -5 TIMES THE ESCAPE VELOCITY. ALTERNATIVELY, THE OBSERVED DIVISION COULD BE INTERPRETED AS A POWER LAW WHERE STELLAR HEATING GOES AS THE FOURTH POWER OF ESCAPE VELOCITY, WHICH MIGHT BE EXPLAINED IF HYDRODYNAMIC ESCAPE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ATMOSPHERIC LOSS RATHER THAN IMPACT EROSION. OUR INVESTIGATION WILL ESTABLISH AN UNDERSTANDING OF PARAMETERS THAT FAVOR ONE ESCAPE PROCESS VERSUS THE OTHER, ELUCIDATING WHICH PROCESS EXPLAINS THE EMPIRICAL ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY LIMITS."

WE WILL USE FULLY NONGREY RADIATIVE-CONVECTIVE ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE CODES WITH CLOUD FORMATION AND VERTICAL MIXING, COMBINED WITH A SELF-CONSISTENT TREATMENT OF GAS CHEMISTRY ABOVE THE MAGMA OCEAN. BEING IN EQUILIBRIUM WITH THE SURFACE, THE VAPORIZED ROCK MATERIAL CAN BE A GOOD TRACER OF THE BULK COMPOSITION OF THE PLANET. WE WILL DERIVE THE ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE AND ESCAPE RATES CONSIDERING BOTH VOLATILEFREE AND VOLATILE BEARING COMPOSITIONS, WHICH REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF HOT ROCKY PLANET ATMOSPHERES. OUR MODELS WILL INFORM FOLLOWUP OBSERVATIONS WITH JWST AND GROUND-BASED INSTRUMENTS, AID THE INTERPRETATION OF TRANSIT AND ECLIPSE SPECTRA, AND PROVIDE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF VOLATILE LOSS IN THESE ATMOSPHERES. SUCH RESULTS WILL HELP REFINE OUR PICTURE OF ROCKY PLANET FORMATION AND EVOLUTION. PLANETS IN ULTRA-SHORT PERIOD (USP) ORBITS ARE A SPECIAL CLASS OF HOT ROCKY EXOPLANETS. AS SHOWN BY KEPLER, THESE PLANETS ARE GENERALLY SMALLER THAN 2 EARTH RADII, SUGGESTING THAT THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE ROCKY AND COULD HAVE LOST THEIR VOLATILES THROUGH PHOTO-EVAPORATION. BEING CLOSE TO THEIR HOST STARS, THESE PLANETS ARE ULTRA-HOT, WITH ESTIMATED TEMPERATURES OF 1000-3000 K. A NUMBER OF USP PLANETS HAVE BEEN ALREADY DISCOVERED (E.G. KEPLER-78 B, COROT-7 B, KEPLER-10 B), AND THIS NUMBER IS EXPECTED TO GROW BY CONFIRMING ADDITIONAL PLANET CANDIDATES. THE CHARACTERIZATION OF PLANETS ON ULTRA-SHORT ORBITS IS ADVANTAGEOUS DUE TO THE LARGER NUMBER OF OBSERVABLE TRANSITS, AND THE LARGER TRANSIT SIGNAL IN THE CASE OF AN EVAPORATING ATMOSPHERE. MUCH ADVANCE HAS BEEN MADE IN UNDERSTANDING AND CHARACTERIZING HOT JUPITERS IN SIMILAR TRANSIT CONFIGURATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, NA HAS BEEN THE FIRST SPECIES TO BE DETECTED IN AN EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERE, BY OBSERVING THE EVAPORATING HOT-JUPITER HD209458B. UNDERSTANDING THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE MAGMA OUTGASSING AND VOLATILE LOSS WILL BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS PROJECT. OUR TEAM HAS THE EXPERTISE IN THE CHEMISTRY, RADIATIVE TRANSFER, AND ATMOSPHERIC ESCAPE MODELING AT THESE EXOTIC TEMPERATURES. OUR RECENT WORK HAS ANALYZED THE EMERGING ATMOSPHERES OF TERRESTRIAL PLANETS AFTER GIANT IMPACTS, USING A WELL-ESTABLISHED RADIATIVECONVECTIVE ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE CODE, WITH AN EXTENSIVE OPACITY DATABASE FOR ALL RELEVANT MOLECULES, AND THE CHEMISTRY SELF-CONSISTENTLY CALCULATED FOR CONTINENTAL CRUST AND BULK SILICATE EARTH COMPOSITIONS. WE WILL EXPAND ON THIS WORK BY CONSIDERING A WIDER RANGE OF CHEMICAL COMPOSITIONS, ASSESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF CLOUDS AND GENERATING CLOUDY MODELS, AND DEVELOPING DIS-EQUILIBRIUM MODELS BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT VERTICAL MIXING AND PHOTOCHEMISTRY. PHOTO-EVAPORATION WILL BE CONSIDERED IN THE ENERGY BALANCE BETWEEN HEATING, COOLING AND MASS LOSS. WE ALSO HAVE IN-HOUSE CODES TO GENERATE HIGH-RESOLUTION ECLIPSE SPECTRA AND PREDICT TRANSIT DEPTHS AND OBSERVABLE SIGNATURES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ATMOSPHERIC CODE, THE MOLECULAR OPACITY UPDATES, THE ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE CALCULATIONS AND THE HIGH RESOLUTION ECLIPSE SPECTRA WILL BE PERFORMED BY R. LUPU, M. MARLEY, AND R.

COMMONLY, THE INTERPLANETARY TRANSPORT OF SEPS IS DESCRIBED BY A KINETIC, FOKKER-PLANCK (FP) TYPE OF EQUATION. HOWEVER, DUE TO ITS DIFFUSIVE NATURE IN THE PERPENDICULAR TRANSPORT, THIS APPROACH FALLS SHORT IN EXPLAINING THE FAST ACCESS OF PARTICLES TO A WIDE RANGE OF LONGITUDES. WE PROPOSE TO EXTEND THE ANALYSIS OF WIDESPREAD SEP EVENTS TO INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF FIELD-LINE WANDERING IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE RELEVANT TRANSPORT PROCESSES IN THESE EVENTS. SCIENCE QUESTIONS: IN THIS PROPOSAL WE AIM TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING SCIENCE QUESTIONS: (1) HOW ARE SEPS ABLE TO QUICKLY ACCESS LONGITUDINALLY WIDELY SEPARATED LOCATIONS IN THE INNER HELIOSPHERE? (2) WHICH ROLE DOES INTERPLANETARY TURBULENCE PLAY IN CROSS-FIELD TRANSPORT OF PARTICLES AND HOW DO SPATIAL VARIATIONS IMPACT ON PARTICLE DISTRIBUTIONS? (3) WHAT IS THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE NEAR-SUN INJECTION REGION OF SEPS VS. INTERPLANETARY TRANSPORT EFFECTS FOR THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF SEPS? (4) HOW ARE ELECTRON ENERGY SPECTRA SHAPED DURING THEIR TRANSPORT FROM COMPACT FLARING REGIONS TO 1AU? METHODS: A COMBINATION OF MODELING AND DATA ANALYSIS WILL HELP TO UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DIFFERENT TRANSPORT PROCESSES INVOLVED IN SEP PROPAGATION. WE WILL USE A NOVEL, RECENTLY DEVELOPED TRANSPORT MODEL WHICH INCLUDES PARTICLE MOTION ALONG FIELD LINES THAT MEANDER AS A RESULT OF PLASMA TURBULENCE. SUCH A NON-DIFFUSIVE PROPAGATION MODE CAN BE SHOWN TO DOMINATE THE SEP CROSS-FIELD PROPAGATION EARLY IN THE SEP EVENT HISTORY. WE WILL COMPARE THE NEW MODEL RESULTS TO THE STANDARD MODELING USING ONLY A FOKKER- PLANCK EQUATION WITH DIFFUSIVE PERPENDICULAR TRANSPORT, USING BOTH IDEALIZED SEP EVENTS AND A DATASET OF SEP OBSERVATIONS. THESE WILL INCLUDE IN-SITU ELECTRON AND ION OBSERVATIONS AND CONTEXTUAL REMOTE OBSERVATIONS OF THE SUN AND SOLAR ATMOSPHERE. RELEVANCE: STUDYING THE TRANSPORT PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH ENERGETIC PARTICLES ARRIVING AT EARTH ORBIT IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE FOR SPACE EXPLORATION, SINCE SEPS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE RADIATION LEVELS IN THE NEAR-EARTH ENVIRONMENT, POTENTIALLY DAMAGING TECHNOLOGICAL ASSETS AND IMPACTING ON THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF HUMANS IN SPACE. OUR PROPOSAL DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE SCIENCE GOALS OF THE STEREO MISSION (\UNDERSTAND HOW SEPS ARE DISTRIBUTED SO EFFICIENTLY AROUND THE SUN\"") AND THREE OF THE FOUR DECADAL SURVEY GOALS. THIS RESEARCH IS TIMELY DUE TO THE OBSERVATIONS OF WIDESPREAD SEP EVENTS BY STEREO AND THE UPCOMING SOLAR PROBE PLUS AND SOLAR ORBITER MISSIONS, WHICH WILL ADD FURTHER TO OUR OBSERVATIONAL BASIS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND ENERGETIC PARTICLE PROPAGATION IN THE INNER HELIOSPHERE."""

CIRCULATING CONCENTRATIONS IN THE BLOODSTREAM WILL BE MEASURED OVER TIME AFTER MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION, PERMITTING MODELED ESTIMATION OF ABSORPTION RATES AND METABOLISM/EXCRETION RATES. SAME-SUBJECT COMPARISONS USING PRE-FLIGHT AND POST-FLIGHT TEST SESSIONS WILL PERMIT MEASUREMENT OF SAME-SUBJECT VARIABILITY THAT WILL PROVIDE A BASELINE FOR DETERMINATION OF CLINICALLY RELEVANT CHANGES DURING SPACEFLIGHT. SPACEFLIGHT VS. GROUND DIFFERENCES IN MEDICATION-ASSOCIATED EFFECTS ON SLEEP, WAKEFULNESS, AND SEVERAL MEASURES OF COGNITIVE FUNCTION WILL BE USED AS MEASURES OF PHARMCODYNAMICS.THIS STUDY WILL DETERMINE IF THE LEO ENVIRONMENT OF THE ISS ALTERS THE ACTIONS OF THREE COMMON MEDICATIONS. A LIKELY OUTCOME, RELEVANT FOR NASA MISSIONS, IS OPTIMIZED DOSING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ONE OR MORE OF THESE MEDICATIONS. IN MORE GENERAL TERMS, THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY WILL INDICATE THE LIKELIHOOD AND MAGNITUDE OF ANY SPACEFLIGHT-ASSOCIATED PK OR PD CHANGES, AND THUS HELP TO DETERMINE FUTURE RESEARCH PRIORITIES. THE GENERAL POPULATION, WHO ALSO USE THESE MEDICATIONS, ARE ALSO LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM ADDITIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THESE MEDICATIONS INTERACT WITH THE HUMAN BODY."

DURING SPACEFLIGHT, THE BODY UNDERGOES A NUMBER OF PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN ALTERED INTERACTIONS WITH ADMINISTERED MEDICATIONS, BUT IT IS NOT YET KNOWN IF, OR TO WHAT EXTENT, THESE ACTUALLY OCCUR. THE POTENTIAL FOR THERAPEUTICALLY RELEVANT ALTERATION IN EITHER PHARMACOKINETICS (HOW THE BODY HANDLES ADMINISTERED MEDICATIONS) OR PHARMACODYNAMICS (HOW ADMINISTERED MEDICATIONS ACT UPON THE BODY) HAS LONG BEEN A CONCERN. THIS OBSERVATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDY IS A PROACTIVE STEP TOWARD ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE VIA REGULAR DIRECT QUESTIONING OF CREWMEMBER VOLUNTEERS, A MODEL THAT THE JSC NUTRITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY DISCIPLINE HAS PROVEN TO BE BOTH FEASIBLE AND USEFUL. A TABLET- OR HANDHELD DEVICE-BASED QUESTIONNAIRE WILL BE USED TO PERMIT FAST AND EFFICIENT COLLECTION OF DATA REGARDING CREWMEMBERS  MEDICATION USE ON A NEAR REAL-TIME BASIS, ELIMINATING THE CURRENT PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH RECALL OVER PERIODS OF WEEKS. SPECIFIC QUESTIONS REGARDING MEDICATION USE (SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THE QUESTIONS THAT PHYSICIANS ASK REGARDING PATIENT HEALTH) WILL BE ASKED OF EACH PARTICIPATING CREWMEMBER. THE DATA COLLECTION PROCESS WILL BE STREAMLINED BY USING A FLEXIBLY PROGRAMMED COMPUTERIZED SURVEY APPLICATION THAT LEVERAGES THE LIMITED MEDICATION CHOICES ABOARD, THE DOSES AVAILABLE, TYPICAL DOSING FREQUENCY, AND SIDE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH MEDICATION TO PROVIDE AN INDIVIDUALIZED SHORT QUESTIONNAIRE FOR EACH MEDICATION USE BY THE CREWMEMBER. CODED (DE-IDENTIFIED) DATA WILL BE DELIVERED WEEKLY TO A SECURE SERVER ON THE GROUND FOR ANALYSIS BY STUDY INVESTIGATORS.

THE ADVANCED AIR TRANSPORT TECHNOLOGY (AATT) PROJECT AND THE PRECEDING SUBSONIC FIXED WING (SFW) PROJECT HAVE IDENTIFIED METRICS AND GOALS FOR THE REDUCTION OF ENERGY COSTS, ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION, AND NOISE POLLUTION FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS (N+2 AND N+3) OF COMMERCIAL AIR VEHICLES. WHILE THE N+2 AND N+3 CONCEPT VEHICLES ARE EXPECTED TO OPERATE IN DIFFERENT ENVELOPES COMPARED TO TODAY S AIR VEHICLES, FUTURE VEHICLES EMPLOYING N+2 AND N+3 TECHNOLOGIES WILL STILL BE EXPECTED TO BE CERTIFIED FOR AND TO FLY THROUGH DANGEROUS ICING CONDITIONS. TO MITIGATE AIRFRAME ICE ACCRETION DANGERS ON AIRCRAFT EMPLOYING N+2 AND N+3 TECHNOLOGIES, DEVELOPING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ICING PHYSICS AND CONVECTIVE HEAT TRANSFER RELATED TO THE INITIAL ICE ROUGHNESS FORMED IN ICING CONDITIONS EXPECTED FOR N+2 AND N+3 BASED AIRCRAFT IS CRUCIAL. THE INITIAL ICE ROUGHNESS FORMED ON THE AIRFOIL SURFACE IS CRITICAL TO THE ACCRETION PROCESS BECAUSE IT INCREASES SKIN FRICTION DRAG, INCREASES DROPLET AND LIQUID WATER COLLECTION EFFICIENCY, AND DRAMATICALLY INCREASES THE CONVECTIVE HEAT TRANSFER RATES. RECENT ICE SHAPE LASER SCANNING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ICING RESEARCH TUNNEL (IRT) AT NASA GLENN RESEARCH CENTER HAVE ENABLED TRANSFORMATIVE INSIGHTS INTO THE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL EVOLUTION OF ROUGHNESS ON SYMMETRIC AIRFOILS IN LOW SPEED CONDITIONS. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL INCLUDE 1) CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF THE AIRFOIL ROUGHNESS EVALUATION SYSTEM (ARES) SOFTWARE FOR LASER SCAN POINT CLOUDS MEASURED ON SWEPT SURFACES OF VARYING CROSS SECTIONAL AREA, 2) ANALYSIS OF ICE ROUGHNESS ACCRETED ON LAMINAR FLOW WINGS AND BLENDED BODY SHAPES REPRESENTATIVE OF N+2 AND N +3 GEOMETRIES USING THE APPROACH OF MCCLAIN AND KREEGER (2013), AND 3) CHARACTERIZATION OF CONVECTION ON SURFACES USING REALISTIC UNWRAPPED ROUGHNESS AND MODEL ROUGHNESS IN A FLAT PLATE SUBSONIC WIND TUNNEL EMPLOYING THIN-FILM HEATERS AND INFRARED SURFACE TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS IN STEADY STATE CONDITIONS. PHASE I EFFORTS WILL FOCUS ON CHARACTERIZING ROUGHNESS EVOLUTION AND ENHANCED CONVECTION ON LAMINAR-FLOW AIRFOILS. PHASE II EFFORTS WILL COMPLETE THE LAMINAR-FLOW AIRFOIL INVESTIGATION AND INCLUDE THE INVESTIGATION OF ROUGHNESS EVOLUTION AND ENHANCED CONVECTION ON SWEPT WINGS AND BLENDED/HYBRID SURFACES. THE PROPOSED COLLABORATIVE ACTIVITIES WILL 1) ILLUMINATE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL ROUGHNESS EVOLUTION FOR N+2 AND N+3 GEOMETRIES AND FLIGHT ENVELOPES, 2) VERIFY PROPER ROUGHNESS SCALING APPROACHES FOR N+2 AND N+3 GEOMETRIES AND FLIGHT ENVELOPES, 3) REVEAL CONVECTIVE ENHANCEMENT CAUSED BY THE ROUGHNESS ON N+2 AND N+3 BASED GEOMETRIES, AND 4) VALIDATE CONVECTION MODELING APPROACHES BASED ON THE DISCRETE-ELEMENT ROUGHNESS APPROACH. THE ROUGHNESS CHARACTERIZATION EFFORTS ARE EXPECTED TO INCLUDE COLLABORATIVE WORK PERFORMED IN THE IRT. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE COST OF OPERATING THE IRT, A PARALLEL PROPOSAL COMPLEMENTING THIS EFFORT IS BEING SUBMITTED BY PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY (PSU) TO GENERATE ICE ROUGHNESS ON STRAIGHT LAMINAR-FLOW AIRFOILS SIMULATING N+2 AND N+3 TECHNOLOGIES USING THE AERTS FACILITY.

SEPARATE WORK HAS ALSO SHOWN THAT AFTER UNLOADING, AN ABRUPT MECHANICAL RELOADING TO 1G CAUSES ADDITIONAL MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURY. HERE, WE PROPOSE TO EMPLOY BOTH PWB AND HINDLIMB UNLOADING MODELS SEQUENTIALLY TO INVESTIGATE GRAVITY AS A CONTINUUM AND ITS IMPACT ON MUSCULOSKELETAL ADAPTATION TO RELOADING. THIS WORK WILL HAVE CRITICAL PRACTICAL AND SCIENTIFIC OUTCOMES, AND WILL PROVIDE FOR THE FIRST TIME, INSIGHTS INTO THE MUSCULOSKELETAL RESPONSES TO ADULT TO FRACTIONAL GRAVITY AFTER A PERIOD OF MICROGRAVITY (AS WOULD OCCUR WHEN TRAVELING TO MARS). IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE MITIGATING EFFECTS OF PARTIAL GRAVITY AFTER EXTENDED UNLOADING. OUR SPECIFIC AIMS ARE: 1. TO DETERMINE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ADAPTATIONS OF THE MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM IN MALES TO THE FRACTIONAL GRAVITY OF EITHER THE MOON OR MARS AFTER EXPERIENCING MICROGRAVITY IN TRANSIT. 2. TO DETERMINE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ADAPTATIONS OF THE MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM IN FEMALES TO THE FRACTIONAL GRAVITY OF EITHER THE MOON OR MARS AFTER EXPERIENCING MICROGRAVITY IN TRANSIT. 3. TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL MUSCULOSKELETAL BENEFITS OF ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY IN-FLIGHT BEFORE RETURNING TO EARTH. SPECIFICALLY, WE PLAN TO INVESTIGATE THE RESULTING MUSCULOSKELETAL ALTERATIONS IN TRANSITIONING FROM 2 WEEKS OF 0G TO 0.2, 0.4, AND 0.7G, HYPOTHESIZING THAT THERE IS A DOSE-DEPENDENCE TO THE RELOADING, INCLUDING RECOVERY AND ASSOCIATED INJURY.

THUS, DESPITE RIGOROUS EXERCISE PROTOCOLS AND OTHER COUNTERMEASURES, MUSCLE ATROPHY AND BONE LOSS ARE STILL VIRTUALLY INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCES OF SPACEFLIGHT. ONE APPROACH FOR AMELIORATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE UNTOWARD CONSEQUENCES OF SPACE TRAVEL IS BY THE INDUCTION OF ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY DURING SPACEFLIGHT VIA CENTRIFUGATION. THE STRENGTH OF THE ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY DEPENDS BOTH ON THE SPEED OF ROTATION AND DIAMETER OF THE SHIP. WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE EQUIVALENT 1.0G, IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT LOWER LEVELS OF FORCE MAY ALSO BE EFFECTIVE FOR PREVENTING MUSCLE ATROPHY AND IRREVERSIBLE BONE LOSS. IN THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSE TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY FOR THE PREVENTION OF MUSCLE ATROPHY AND WEAKNESS AND BONE LOSS BY STUDYING RATS USING AN INNOVATIVE SYSTEM FOR PARTIAL UNLOADING THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED PREVIOUSLY FOR MICE BY MEMBERS OF OUR TEAM.

WE DEFINE THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC AS THE REGION ENCOMPASSED BY THE GREENLAND-ICELAND-NORWEGIAN (GIN), IRMINGER AND LABRADOR SEAS, WHERE WARMER AND SALTIER AW LADEN WITH NUTRIENTS, PLANKTON AND DETRITUS MOVES NORTH IN MULTIPLE BRANCHES INTO THE LABRADOR SEA, INTO THE GIN SEAS AND, EVENTUALLY, INTO THE ARCTIC OCEAN. FRESHER AND COLDER ARW WITH SEA ICE, LOW NUTRIENTS, LOW PLANKTON AND HIGH COLORED DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER MOVES SOUTHWARDS ALONG THE EDGE OF THE EASTERN GREENLAND AND WESTERN LABRADOR SEAS AND INTO THE N. ATLANTIC. . HERE, WE WILL FOCUS ON THE BALANCE OF NETPP IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC AS AFFECTED BY (I) ADVECTIVE LOSSES AND GAINS WITHIN THIS REGION AT LARGE-SCALES INTERACTION WITH RESPECT TO BOUNDARY CONDITIONS IN THE TEMPERATE N. ATLANTIC AND ARCTIC OCEANS; (II) LATERAL AND VERTICAL  EXPORT  PRODUCTION WITHIN SUB-REGIONS OF THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC AT INTERMEDIATE SCALES; AND (III) ADVECTIVE AND LOCAL PROCESSES CONTROLLING NETPP IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC REGION. OUR QUESTIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: . (Q1) WHAT BOTTOM-UP (PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL) FACTORS CONTROL THE NETPP LEVELS IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC, WHERE AND WHEN? (Q2) WHAT ARE THE CONTROLS OF SEASONAL AND SUB-SEASONAL VARIABILITIES AND TRENDS IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC? (Q3) WHAT IS THE BALANCE BETWEEN LOCAL AND ADVECTED NETPP IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC DURING THE GROWTH SEASON? . WE PROPOSE TO USE A HIERARCHY OF MODELS INCLUDING A FULL 3D, COUPLED, BIOGEOCHEMICAL-PHYSICAL MODEL AT REGIONAL SCALE (SINMOD) AND A SPECIALIZED 1D SATELLITE OCEAN COLOR MODEL FOR PHYTOPLANKTON NETPP (UQAR-TAKUVIK), BOTH OF WHICH ARE EXCEPTIONALLY WELL TUNED TO HIGH LATITUDES. MODEL SIMULATIONS WILL BE DONE IN CONCERT WITH MINING HISTORICAL FIELD AND SATELLITE DATA TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF NETPP AND ITS PHYSICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CONTROLS OVER AN AVERAGE ANNUAL CYCLE IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC. . OUR RESULTS WILL SHED LIGHT IF THE MAGNITUDE OF NETPP WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE DUE TO ENHANCED STRATIFICATION (WARMER AW OR FRESHER ARW CONDITIONS, LESS NUTRIENTS) AND GRAZING (IMMIGRATING OR RETURNING ZOOPLANKTON). ALTERNATIVELY, LESS SEA ICE IN FRAM STRAIT AND THE GREENLAND SEA MAY RESULT IN MORE AND EARLIER OPEN WATERS AND LESS STRATIFICATION THAT MAY LEAD TO HIGHER NETPP VALUES, AS HAS BEEN PREDICTED NORTH AND EAST OF SPITSBERGEN. A NORTHWARDS SHIFT IN NETPP DUE TO ENHANCED AW ADVECTION IS EXPECTED. . OUR PROJECT RESPONDS TO THE ROSES 2015 A.3 OBB (AMENDED) ACTIVITY 2.3  RESEARCH IN SUPPORT OF THE GALWAY STATEMENT: NORTH ATLANTIC-ARCTIC OCEANOGRAPHIC PROCESSES  BY FOCUSING ON THE EXCHANGES ACROSS, AND PROCESSES WITHIN, THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC AND THEIR EFFECT ON NETPP, IN A REGION LOCATED NORTH OF THE NASA-SPONSORED EXPORTS SELECTED N. ATLANTIC FIELD SITE, WITH A TEAM OF CANADIAN, DANISH, NORWEGIAN AND US RESEARCHERS. OUR PROJECT WILL OPENLY SHARE ALL FIELD DATA ASSEMBLED AS WELL AS PROMOTE RESEARCHER MOBILITY BY INCLUDING A POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW AND A PART-TIME GRADUATE STUDENT, BOTH OF WHOM WILL GAIN INTERNATIONAL NETWORKING AND EXPERIENCE."

WHILE RECENT ADVANCES IN DNA SEQUENCING METAGENOMIC AND SINGLE CELL GENOMIC TECHNIQUES HAVE REVOLUTIONIZED THE ABILITY TO UNCOVER GENOMIC INFORMATION FROM THESE GROUPS, LINKAGE OF THIS INFORMATION TO FUNCTION IN THE ENVIRONMENT IS TENUOUS. THIS CHALLENGE IS MAGNIFIED IN LOW-ENERGY ANALOG ENVIRONMENTS, WHERE MEASURING RATES OF ACTIVITY IS DIFFICULT DUE TO DETECTION LIMITS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO TACKLE THIS CHALLENGE THROUGH APPLICATION OF NASCENT SINGLE-CELL-LEVEL FLUORESCENT SUBSTRATE LABELING TECHNIQUES THAT IDENTIFY ACTIVE CELLS USING FLOW CYTOMETRIC SORTING AND GENOMIC SEQUENCING IN A RELEVANT ANALOG SYSTEM. THE PROJECT WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SAMPLES-OF-OPPORTUNITY TO BE COLLECTED FROM THE SUBSURFACE ENVIRONMENT OF EARTH S OCEANIC CRUST (AND ICY WORLDS ANALOG), WHERE FLUID-ROCK REACTIONS IN MAFIC ROCKS SUPPORT AN ENERGY-LIMITED CHEMOLITHOTROPHIC ECOSYSTEM. SPECIFICALLY, THIS PROJECT WILL LEVERAGE AN NSF-FUNDED EXPEDITION IN 2019 TO SUBSEAFLOOR OBSERVATORIES ON THE EASTERN FLANK OF THE JUAN DE FUCA RIDGE TO ENABLE IN SITU EXPERIMENTATION AND COLLECTION OF PRISTINE SAMPLES. LIVE MICROBIAL CELLS IN THIS HIGH-PRESSURE, THERMOPHILIC (64 C), ANOXIC SYSTEM WILL BE SELECTED THROUGH INCORPORATION OF FLUOROGENIC SUBSTRATES INSIDE THE CELL, ENABLING SORTING OF THESE CELLS FROM THE BULK COMMUNITY THROUGH FLOW CYTOMETRY. VARIOUS METABOLISMS INCLUDING CARBON MONOXIDE, IRON, AND SULFUR OXIDATION WILL BE EXPLORED THROUGH ENRICHMENT EXPERIMENTS   PATHWAYS OF RELEVANCE TO CONSTRAINING CHEMOLITHOTROPHY ON EXTRATERRESTRIAL TARGETS LIKE EUROPA AND ENCELADUS. PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED WITH SIMILAR SUBSURFACE OCEAN CRUST SAMPLES FROM A DIFFERENT SYSTEM CONFIRM THAT CELLS IN LOW BIOMASS, LOW ENERGY SYSTEMS CAN BE LABELED IN THIS WAY, AND THAT THESE CELLS ARE AMENABLE TO DOWNSTREAM GENOME SEQUENCING. IF SUCCESSFUL, RESULTS OF THIS PROJECT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCE UNDERSTANDING OF THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONAL POTENTIAL AND VIABILITY OF VARIOUS MEMBERS OF LOW-ENERGY SUBSURFACE ANALOG MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY ARE DOMINANT OR RARE MEMBERS OF THE POPULATION. THIS WOULD ESTABLISH A REVOLUTIONARY APPROACH TO CONNECTING PHYSIOLOGY TO GENOMIC INFORMATION, WHICH HAS APPLICATIONS BEYOND EXOBIOLOGY. CONFIRMING THE APPLICATION OF THIS METHOD IN A REMOTE ANALOG SYSTEM WOULD IMPACT NASA MISSION INTERESTS SEEKING TO IDENTIFY METHODS FOR BIOSIGNATURE DETECTION AND POSSIBLE SCENARIOS FOR EXPERIMENTATION ON FUTURE ROVERS TO IDENTIFY LIFE. THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS RELEVANT TO SPECIFIC RESEARCH EMPHASES IN THIS SOLICITATION AS WELL AS SEVERAL OF THE MAJOR TOPICS IN THE NASA ASTROBIOLOGY STRATEGY 2015. BY SORTING ACTIVE CELLS FROM OCEAN CRUST ANALOG ENVIRONMENTS, AND THEN BEING ABLE TO DIRECTLY LINK CELL PHYSIOLOGY WITH GENOMIC INFORMATION, THIS PROJECT DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE SOLICITATION INTERESTS IN UNDERSTANDING THE PHYLOGENY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF EXTREMOPHILE MICROORGANISMS THAT MAY REFLECT THE NATURE OF PRIMITIVE ENVIRONMENTS AND THE CO-EVOLUTION OF THESE MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES THAT DRIVE THE BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES IN THESE ANALOG ENVIRONMENTS, WHICH IS LIKEWISE DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THEMES IN THE MAJOR TOPIC  CO-EVOLUTION OF LIFE AND THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT .

IT DETECTS CACO3 OF COCCOLITHOPHORES DUE TO THEIR RELATIVELY HIGH ABUNDANCE IN THE SEA AND THEIR EXTREMELY HIGH PIC-SPECIFIC OPTICAL BACKSCATTERING. BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHERS HAVE GENERALLY FOCUSED ON THE MOST VISIBLE, MESOSCALE COCCOLITHOPHORE BLOOMS AT HIGH LATITUDES (REPRESENTING 5% OF TIME AND SPACE), AS COMPARED TO THE MUCH-LESS-ABUNDANT COCCOLITHOPHORE POPULATIONS FOUND IN OTHER ENVIRONMENTS (95% OF TIME AND SPACE).

OUR APPLICATION OF MISR TO COCCOLITHOPHORE STUDIES WILL ALLOW SMALLER-SCALE MEASUREMENTS OF BLOOMS AT #tilde#1/4 THE SPATIAL SCALE OF MODIS, WHICH WILL PROVIDE INSIGHTS ABOUT THE VARIOUS PHYSICAL PROCESSES AFFECTING THEIR DISTRIBUTION IN SPACE AND TIME. THE ADVENT OF AQUARIUS SALINITY DATA, WHEN COMBINED WITH MODIS SST DATA, NOW ALLOWS THE ESTIMATION OF SEA SURFACE DENSITY AND, USING GRADIENT FINDING ALGORITHMS, WILL ALLOW US TO DETERMINE WHETHER STEEP GRADIENTS IN COCCOLITHOPHORE DENSITY FALL AT MAJOR OCEAN HYDROGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES. VARIOUS OTHER DATA SETS AVAILABLE FROM THE CURRENT CONSTELLATION OF EARTH OBSERVING SATELLITES (E.G., WIND SPEED) WILL ALSO ALLOW BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPORTANCE OF FRONTAL BOUNDARIES AND WIND MIXING (USING AMSR-E; AQUARIUS), AS THEY INFLUENCE GLOBAL CALCITE PRODUCTION IN THE SEA.

WE PROPOSE TO USE A COMBINATION OF SATELLITE AND GNATS DATA (SHIPBOARD AND AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE MEASUREMENTS) TO CONSTRAIN A COUPLED PHYSICAL/ECOSYSTEM MODEL OF THE GOM CARBON CYCLE. THE OVERALL SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS IS THAT GNATS HAS PROVIDED CRITICAL CALIBRATION/VALIDATION DATA FOR SEAWIFS, MODIS, AND VIIRS SENSORS, AS WELL AS INSIGHTS ABOUT THE LONG-TERM OCEANOGRAPHIC CARBON CYCLE CHANGES IN THE GOM, A SEMI-ENCLOSED SHELF SEA, WITH STRONG LAND-SEA CONNECTIONS VIA 25 SURROUNDING WATERSHEDS. WE DIRECT THIS PROPOSAL TO THE SECOND RESEARCH THEME OF THE NASA ROSES 13 CARBON CYCLE SCIENCE PROGRAM: CARBON DYNAMICS ALONG TERRESTRIAL-AQUATIC INTERFACES, INCLUDING LAND-OCEAN, LAND-FRESHWATER, AND COASTAL OCEAN REGIONS. THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE MAJOR IMPORTANCE OF RIVER RUNOFF TO THE PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, OPTICAL AND BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY OF THE GOM, INCLUDING ITS CARBON CYCLE. THIS WORK IS PRIMARILY RELEVANT TO NASA (GIVEN THE NASA-CENTRIC GNATS SAMPLING) AND SECONDARILY TO NOAA, SPECIFICALLY FOR WORK ON PRODUCTIVITY, ALGAL BIOMASS, AND PHYTOPLANKTON FUNCTIONAL GROUPS OF U. S. COASTAL WATERS, AS WELL AS CALIBRATION/VALIDATION OF THE NPP/VIIRS SENSOR. ALONG WITH A WHOLE HOST OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES, GNATS MEASURES ALL FOUR PARTS OF THE MARINE CARBON CYCLE: PARTICULATE ORGANIC CARBON (POC), PARTICULATE INORGANIC CARBON (PIC; CALCITE), DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC), AND DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON (DIC; E.G., CO2, HCO3-, AND CO3=, WHICH ARE COUPLED TO PH AND ALKALINITY). THESE FOUR PARTS OF THE CARBON CYCLE (INCLUDING RESERVOIRS AND FLUXES) PROVIDE INSIGHTS ABOUT THE MAJOR PROCESSES AFFECTING THE COASTAL OCEAN, FROM CHANGES IN PRODUCTIVITY (I.E. POC VARIABILITY THROUGH TIME ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN HYDROGRAPHY, DIFFERENT PHYTOPLANKTON FUNCTIONAL GROUPS, ETC.), LAND-SEA CARBON TRANSPORT (I.E. DOC AND POC VARIABILITY CAUSED BY MAJOR RIVERINE FLOOD EVENTS AND DROUGHTS), AND CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH OCEAN ACIDIFICATION (I.E. VARIABILITY IN DIC AND PIC CAUSED BY CHANGES IN CARBONATE SATURATION). SIMPLY PUT, THE ONLY WAY TO PREDICT CHANGES TO ALL FOUR PARTS OF THE MARINE CARBON CYCLE AS A FUNCTION OF LONG-TERM CLIMATE CHANGE WILL BE THROUGH A COMBINED MEASUREMENT AND MODELING APPROACH. THE ECOSYSTEM MODEL TO BE USED FOR THE GULF OF MAINE CARBON CYCLE CONSISTS OF SIZE-STRUCTURED CARBON POOLS OF DETRITAL MATERIAL, PHYTOPLANKTON FUNCTIONAL TYPES RANGING FROM PICOPLANKTON TO MICROPLANKTON, AND A SIZE-BASED ZOOPLANKTON PREDATOR GROUP. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN COMPONENTS WILL BE DETERMINED BY BOTH SIZE AND FUNCTIONAL ROLE, AND THE MODEL WILL BE FORCED BY GOM PHYSICAL CONDITIONS. WE WILL VALIDATE THE MODEL AGAINST GNATS DATA, AND TEST THE ABILITY OF REMOTELY-SENSED PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS, COUPLED WITH THE ECOSYSTEM MODEL, TO REPRODUCE THE OBSERVED DYNAMICS. WE WILL THEN USE THE MODEL TO TEST HYPOTHESES REGARDING THE FATE OF CARBON RESULTING FROM CLIMATE-DRIVEN CHANGES SUCH AS INCREASED PRECIPITATION AND TEMPERATURE. ANTICIPATED SCIENTIFIC OUTCOMES FROM THIS WORK WILL BE A) A LONGER DURATION, NASA-CENTRIC, COASTAL TIME SERIES THAT CAN RESOLVE CLIMATOLOGICAL PHENOMENA SPANNING TIME SCALES OF DAYS TO DECADES AND B) A COUPLED PHYSICAL/ECOSYSTEM MODEL BASED ON GNATS THAT USES REMOTELY-SENSED, SHIP AND AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE DATA TO CONSTRAIN THE MODEL AND TEST HYPOTHESES RELEVANT TO EACH PART OF THE GOM CARBON CYCLE AND THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE."

THE MERGED TWO-BAND/THREE-BAND ALGORITHM IS FUNDAMENTALLY A CASE I ALGORITHM; THAT IS, IT IS DESIGNED FOR AREAS WHERE SUSPENDED SEDIMENTS,RIVER-BORN SEDIMENTS OR COLORED DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OCEAN OPTICAL PROPERTIES. THE PIC ALGORITHM ACCOUNTS FOR 78% OF THE VARIANCE IN FIELD-MEASURED PIC AND THE STANDARD ERROR OF PIC DETERMINATIONS (COMPARED TO SHIPBOARD VALIDATION DATA) IS +/-0.08MMOL M^-3, COMPARABLE TO THE PIC CONCENTRATIONS FOUND IN OLIGOTROPHIC GYRES. BUT THERE IS STILL CONSIDERABLE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE PIC ALGORITHM. THESE STATISTICS CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED IF THE SATELLITE DATA ARE BINNED IN SPACE AND TIME (RELATIVELY EASY TO DO WITH SATELLITE DATA, BUT THIS OBVIOUSLY COMPROMISES TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION). IN CASE I WATERS, ERRORS IN THE ALGORITHM RESULT FROM: (A) THE CALCITE-SPECIFIC BACKSCATTERING CROSS-SECTION ATTRIBUTED TO COCCOLITHOPHORES; (B) ERRORS IN THE CHLOROPHYLL-DEPENDENT BACKSCATTERING ATTRIBUTED TO PHYTOPLANKTON; AND (C) PRESENCE OF OTHER SCATTERING MINERALS, SUCH AS BIOGENIC SILICA FROM DIATOM FRUSTULES, WHICH DO NOT SCATTER AS INTENSELY AS PIC, BUT NONETHELESS CAN CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANT OPTICAL BACKSCATTERING. I PROPOSE TO CONTINUE EVALUATING NEW DATA SETS FOR PIC (GENERATED FROM OTHER ONGOING STUDIES) IN ORDER TO REVISE PIC ALGORITHM COEFFICIENTS AND LOOK-UP TABLES. REGARDING THE FIRST SOURCE OF ERROR, I WILL FOCUS ON BETTER DEFINING THE BACKSCATTERING CROSS-SECTION OF CALCITE COCCOLITHS GEOGRAPHICALLY. IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR ESTIMATE OF THE BACKSCATTERING CROSS-SECTION FOR CALCITE COCCOLITHS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF THE PIC ALGORITHM. REGARDING THE SECOND SOURCE OF ERROR, I WILL EXPERIMENT WITH NEW ALGORITHMS FOR DERIVING CHLOROPHYLL CONCENTRATION (E.G., THE REFLECTANCE DIFFERENCING ALGORITHM OF HU ET AL., 2012). THIS WILL PROVIDE A BETTER DERIVATION OF THE BACKSCATTERING ASSOCIATED WITH CHLOROPHYLL CONTAINING PHYTOPLANKTON, WHICH, IN TURN, WILL ALLOW IMPROVED ESTIMATES OF PIC. THIS WORK WILL BE IN COLLABORATION WITH DR. CHUAMIN HU (UNIV. SOUTH FLORIDA). REGARDING THE THIRD SOURCE OF ERROR, I WILL CORRECT FOR THE PRESENCE OF BIOGENIC SILICA, WHICH IS UBIQUITOUS OVER THE GLOBE AND A POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT LIGHT SCATTERING CONTRIBUTOR IN ITS OWN RIGHT. MOREOVER, BIOGENIC SILICA CAN NOW BE ESTIMATED REMOTELY (BALCH ET AL., 2010). ACCOUNTING FOR THIS COMPONENT OF THE BACKSCATTERING SIGNAL WILL ALLOW BETTER ESTIMATES OF PIC BACKSCATTERING AND DERIVATION OF PIC CONCENTRATION. I WILL COMPARE ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION FOR BOTH MODIS AQUA AND MODIS TERRA SATELLITES AND PERFORM FULL ERROR ANALYSES OF THE REVISED ALGORITHM IN THE INTEREST OF PROVIDING SEAMLESS, CLIMATE-QUALITY, PIC DATA. ALTHOUGH THE FOCUS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS ON CONTINUITY OF THE TERRA AND AQUA PIC PRODUCT, THE ALGORITHM CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO VIIRS IMAGERY. DR. HOWARD GORDON (UNIV.

A FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE IS TO PREDICT WHETHER NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION (NETPP) IN THIS REGION WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE UNDER CHANGING NORTHERLY AND SOUTHERLY ADVECTIVE FLOWS. HERE, WE SUGGEST THAT THE BALANCE WILL DEPEND ON REGIONAL BOTTOM-UP DRIVERS (E.G., STRATIFICATION, NUTRIENT AND LIGHT AVAILABILITY, COMMUNITY COMPOSITION) AND TOP-DOWN DRIVERS (E.G., GRAZING). A GROWING UNDERSTANDING OF THE SURFACE AND DEEP OVERFLOWS, COUNTERFLOWS, AND RECIRCULATION PATTERNS WITHIN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC IS EMERGING THAT INDICATES STRONGER INFLUENCES OF THE ATLANTIC SURFACE WATER (AW) AND ARCTIC-ORIGIN WATER (ARW) ON EACH OTHER AND ON THE AVERAGE CIRCULATION PATTERNS WITHIN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. WE DEFINE THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC AS THE REGION ENCOMPASSED BY THE GREENLAND-ICELAND-NORWEGIAN (GIN), IRMINGER AND LABRADOR SEAS, WHERE WARMER AND SALTIER AW LADEN WITH NUTRIENTS, PLANKTON AND DETRITUS MOVES NORTH IN MULTIPLE BRANCHES INTO THE LABRADOR SEA, INTO THE GIN SEAS AND, EVENTUALLY, INTO THE ARCTIC OCEAN. FRESHER AND COLDER ARW WITH SEA ICE, LOW NUTRIENTS, LOW PLANKTON AND HIGH COLORED DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER MOVES SOUTHWARDS ALONG THE EDGE OF THE EASTERN GREENLAND AND WESTERN LABRADOR SEAS AND INTO THE N. ATLANTIC. HERE, WE WILL FOCUS ON THE BALANCE OF NETPP IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC AS AFFECTED BY (I) ADVECTIVE LOSSES AND GAINS WITHIN THIS REGION AT LARGE-SCALES INTERACTION WITH RESPECT TO BOUNDARY CONDITIONS IN THE TEMPERATE N. ATLANTIC AND ARCTIC OCEANS; (II) LATERAL AND VERTICAL EXPORT PRODUCTION WITHIN SUB-REGIONS OF THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC AT INTERMEDIATE SCALES; AND (III) ADVECTIVE AND LOCAL PROCESSES CONTROLLING NETPP IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC REGION. OUR QUESTIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: (Q1) WHAT BOTTOM-UP (PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL) FACTORS CONTROL THE NETPP LEVELS IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC, WHERE AND WHEN? (Q2) WHAT ARE THE CONTROLS OF SEASONAL AND SUB-SEASONAL VARIABILITIES AND TRENDS IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC? (Q3) WHAT IS THE BALANCE BETWEEN LOCAL AND ADVECTED NETPP IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC DURING THE GROWTH SEASON? WE PROPOSE TO USE A HIERARCHY OF MODELS INCLUDING A FULL 3D, COUPLED, BIOGEOCHEMICAL-PHYSICAL MODEL AT REGIONAL SCALE (SINMOD) AND A SPECIALIZED 1D SATELLITE OCEAN COLOR MODEL FOR PHYTOPLANKTON NETPP (UQAR-TAKUVIK), BOTH OF WHICH ARE EXCEPTIONALLY WELL TUNED TO HIGH LATITUDES. MODEL SIMULATIONS WILL BE DONE IN CONCERT WITH MINING HISTORICAL FIELD AND SATELLITE DATA TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF NETPP AND ITS PHYSICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CONTROLS OVER AN AVERAGE ANNUAL CYCLE IN THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC. OUR RESULTS WILL SHED LIGHT IF THE MAGNITUDE OF NETPP WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE DUE TO ENHANCED STRATIFICATION (WARMER AW OR FRESHER ARW CONDITIONS, LESS NUTRIENTS) AND GRAZING (IMMIGRATING OR RETURNING ZOOPLANKTON). ALTERNATIVELY, LESS SEA ICE IN FRAM STRAIT AND THE GREENLAND SEA MAY RESULT IN MORE AND EARLIER OPEN WATERS AND LESS STRATIFICATION THAT MAY LEAD TO HIGHER NETPP VALUES, AS HAS BEEN PREDICTED NORTH AND EAST OF SPITSBERGEN. A NORTHWARDS SHIFT IN NETPP DUE TO ENHANCED AW ADVECTION IS EXPECTED. OUR PROJECT RESPONDS TO THE ROSES 2015 A.3 OBB (AMENDED) ACTIVITY 2.3 RESEARCH IN SUPPORT OF THE GALWAY STATEMENT: NORTH ATLANTIC-ARCTIC OCEANOGRAPHIC PROCESSES BY FOCUSING ON THE EXCHANGES ACROSS, AND PROCESSES WITHIN, THE SUBARCTIC ATLANTIC AND THEIR EFFECT ON NETPP, IN A REGION LOCATED NORTH OF THE NASA-SPONSORED EXPORTS SELECTED N. ATLANTIC FIELD SITE, WITH A TEAM OF CANADIAN, DANISH, NORWEGIAN AND US RESEARCHERS. OUR PROJECT WILL OPENLY SHARE ALL FIELD DATA ASSEMBLED AS WELL AS PROMOTE RESEARCHER MOBILITY BY INCLUDING A POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW AND A PART-TIME GRADUATE STUDENT, BOTH OF WHOM WILL GAIN INTERNATIONAL NETWORKING AND EXPERIENCE"

COASTAL OCEANS CONTRIBUTE ABOUT 1/3 OF THE TOTAL MARINE PRODUCTIVITY ACROSS THE GLOBE (OR ABOUT 16 PG (1PG =1E15G)). THEY RECEIVE ABOUT 1PG FROM TERRESTRIAL DISCHARGE VIA RIVERS. THEY CONTRIBUTE ABOUT HALF OF THE TOTAL GLOBAL OCEAN NEW PRODUCTION (3.6PG). THESE ARE BIG NUMBERS YET WE STILL DO NOT KNOW WHETHER COASTAL MARGINS ARE NET SOURCES OR SINKS FOR CARBON. THERE ARE FOUR COMPONENTS OF THE CARBON CYCLE PARTICULATE ORGANIC CARBON (POC), PARTICULATE INORGANIC CARBON (PIC), DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC), AND DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON (DIC). THE FIRST THREE CARBON FRACTIONS (POC, PIC, AND DOC) CAN BE ESTIMATED USING OPTICAL PROXIES WHILE THE FOURTH (DIC, ASSOCIATED WITH OCEAN ACIDIFICATION) IS BEST MEASURED CHEMICALLY. THERE ARE FEW COASTAL TIME SERIES THAT ASSESS ALL OF THESE COMPONENTS. THIS PROPOSAL IS A SUCCESSOR PROPOSAL FOR THE GULF OF MAINE NORTH ATLANTIC TIME SERIES (GNATS), AN 18-YEAR TRANSECT TIME SERIES ACROSS THE GULF OF MAINE (GOM) USING FERRIES, SMALL RESEARCH VESSELS, AND GLIDERS TO MEASURE ALL FOUR PARTS OF THE CARBON CYCLE. DURING SEVERAL ANOMALOUSLY WET YEARS, GNATS DOCUMENTED SOME FUNDAMENTAL SHIFTS IN THE GOM SUCH AS SIGNIFICANT DROPS IN PRIMARY PRODUCTION (ASSOCIATED WITH POC AND PIC PRODUCTION) AND THE APPEARANCE OF UNEXPECTED HIGHLY SCATTERING PARTICLES<0.2UM DIAMETER (HENCE DOC), WELL OUT TO SEA. WE HAVE ALSO OBSERVED WINTER DIC CONCENTRATIONS ACROSS THE GOM, LOW ENOUGH THAT THE ENTIRE GOM CAN SHOW LOW ARAGONITE SATURATION VALUES<1.6 LEVELS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE INHIBITORY TO CALCIFICATION BY CERTAIN MARINE ORGANISMS. HERE WE ARE PROPOSING TO (A) CONTINUE THE GNATS FOR THREE YEARS WITH EIGHT CRUISES PER YEAR (SIX ABOARD A COMMERCIAL FERRY AND TWO ABOARD A SMALL RESEARCH VESSEL) FOCUSING ON THE FOUR PARTS OF THE GOM CARBON CYCLE, (B) FURTHER VALIDATE SATELLITE OCEAN-COLOR SENSORS FOR RADIANCE AND OTHER PRODUCTS IN THIS COMPLEX OPTICAL ENVIRONMENT, (C) MAKE GNATS INTO AN EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATORY BY TESTING A RANGE OF HYPOTHESES ON CHANGING PRODUCTIVITY AND THE SOURCE OF SUBMICRON SCATTERING PARTICLES, (D) CONSTRUCT CARBON CYCLE MODELS OF THE GOM BASED ON BIOGEOCHEMICAL FLUXES AND ALLOMETRIC SCALING PERFORMING MODEL INTERCOMPARISON AND HYPOTHESIS TESTING USING THE MODELS, AND (E) CONTINUE A COLLABORATION IN WHICH WE ARE DEPLOYING AN ABOVE-WATER LIDAR (LIGHT DETECTION AND RANGING) FROM THE GNATS, ASSESSING THE LIDAR''S ABILITY TO PROFILE OPTICAL PROPERTIES DEEPER THAN ONE OPTICAL DEPTH. WE INCLUDE PREVIOUS RESULTS DEMONSTRATING THAT WE CAN TRACK WATER MASSES USING TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY, THEN DOCUMENT CO-VARYING CHANGES IN POC (BASED ON AN OPTICAL PROXY TO PARTICLE BACKSCATTERING), OXYGEN, AND CHLOROPHYLL IN THESE WATER MASSES; THESE ALLOW THE ESTIMATION OF NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION (NPP) AND NET COMMUNITY PRODUCTION. WE ALSO SHOW HOW ALLOMETRIC SCALING MODELS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THESE ESTIMATIONS. WE ARE REQUESTING FUNDS TO UPGRADE ONE OF OUR SLOCUM GLIDERS TO CARRY A SUNA NITRATE SENSOR THAT WILL ALLOW US TO MORE ACCURATELY ESTIMATE NITRATE DEPLETION AND NPP. THESE GLIDER RESULTS WILL ALLOW US TO BETTER DISCERN AND QUANTIFY WHETHER THE GOM IS A NET SOURCE OR SINK FOR CARBON. ALONG WITH A WHOLE HOST OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES, GNATS PROVIDES CRITICAL INSIGHTS ABOUT THE MAJOR PROCESSES AFFECTING ALL ASPECTS OF THE CARBON CYCLE IN THIS TEMPERATE COASTAL REGION: CHANGES IN PRODUCTIVITY, HYDROGRAPHY, PHYTOPLANKTON FUNCTIONAL GROUPS, LAND-SEA CARBON TRANSPORT CAUSED BY MAJOR RIVERINE FLOOD EVENTS AND DROUGHTS, PLUS POTENTIAL CHANGES DUE TO OCEAN ACIDIFICATION. SUCH RESULTS WILL PROVIDE INSIGHTS TO OTHER TEMPERATE COASTAL ZONES AROUND THE GLOBE. SIMPLY PUT, A SUSTAINED, COMBINED MEASUREMENT AND MODELING APPROACH, SUCH AS THE KIND WE ARE PROPOSING HERE, IS THE OPTIMAL WAY FOR NASA TO PREDICT CHANGES TO ALL FOUR PARTS OF THE MARINE CARBON CYCLE AS A FUNCTION OF LONG-TERM CLIMATE CHANGE IN THIS COMPLEX COASTAL Z"

BASIC RESEARCH USES INCLUDE TWILIGHT AND NIGHTTIME DIURNAL OR POLAR WINTER STUDIES (E.G. AEROSOL OPTICAL DEPTH FROM SHADOW BAND IRRADIANCE INSTRUMENTS), AND OTHER MOON-LIT MEASUREMENTS INCLUDING AIRBORNE OCEAN COLOR MISSIONS. WHILE PHASE 1 MOVED THE PROTOTYPE FROM A TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVEL (TRL) OF 3, TO 4, THE PHASE 2 EFFORT WILL ADVANCE THE TRL OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY FROM A VALUE OF 4 TO A VALUE OF 6 OVER THE PERIOD OF THE SBIR PHASE 2. THIS TECHNOLOGY, KNOWN AS LOLUX (LOWEST OBSERVABLE LIGHT UPGRADEDXTRA CLASS INSTRUMENTS), WITH IRRADIANCE (LOLUX-E) AND RADIANCE (LOLUX-L) SENSORS, WILL BE SUPPORTED WITH A PORTABLE, STABILIZED LED-BASED LIGHT SOURCE TO INSURE THAT THE SENSORS EXHIBIT THE DESIRED STABILITY DURING EXTENDED DEPLOYMENTS. FOLLOWING AN EXTENSIVE CHARACTERIZATION PERIOD, THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL BE DEMONSTRATED IN THE FIELD AND DELIVERED TO NASA."

RECENT DISCOVERIES BY THE KEPLER MISSION AND GROUND-BASED SURVEYS HAVE SHOWN THAT DYNAMICALLY STABLE PLANETARY SYSTEMS EXIST AND ARE ABUNDANT AROUND MANY BINARY STARS. FUTURE MISSIONS, SUCH AS TESS AND PLATO, WILL DISCOVER NEARBY PLANETS IN BINARY SYSTEMS, WHICH COULD BE FURTHER CHARACTERIZED SPECTROSCOPICALLY WITH JWST. THE RECENTLY LAUNCHED GAIA ASTROMETRY TELESCOPE, WHICH OBSERVES 1 BILLION STARS IN OUR GALAXY (1% OF THE GALACTIC STELLAR POPULATION), IS PROVIDING UNPRECEDENTED POSITIONAL AND RADIAL VELOCITY MEASUREMENTS THAT CAN REVEAL FURTHER PLANETS IN BINARY SYSTEMS. AS WITH PLANETS AROUND SINGLE STARS, THESE PLANETS IN BINARY SYSTEMS CONTINUE TO RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR POTENTIAL HABITABILITY. PREVIOUS STUDIES OF THE HABITABLE ZONE (HZ) OF BINARY SYSTEMS CONSIDERED ONLY THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN THE PEAK OF THE COMBINED SPECTRAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTION (SED) OF THE TWO STARS; HOWEVER, THE SPECTRAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTION (SED) FOR PLANETS IN BINARY SYSTEMS SHOULD BE A SUPERPOSITION OF BOTH HOST STARS. HABITABILITY IS DEFINED AS THE ABILITY OF A TERRESTRIAL PLANET TO SUSTAIN LIQUID WATER ON ITS SURFACE, WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE ENERGY BALANCE OF A PLANET S ATMOSPHERE. GREENHOUSE GASES LIKE WATER VAPOR AND CARBON DIOXIDE ABSORB RADIATION AT BOTH LONG (INFRARED) AND SHORT (ULTRAVIOLET) WAVELENGTHS, WHICH MAKES THE CLIMATE SENSITIVE TO THE FULL COMBINED SED OF BOTH STARS. WE EXPECT THAT THE HZ FOR PLANETS IN BINARY SYSTEMS SHOULD BE A FUNCTION OF THE SED OF THE BINARY SYSTEM, WHICH WILL DEPEND UPON THE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF EACH STELLAR SYSTEM. WE WILL ALSO STUDY THE DIFFERENCES IN DIURNAL PATTERNS OF SOLAR INSOLATION CAUSED BY BOTH P-TYPE AND S-TYPE PLANETARY ORBITS WITHIN BINARY SYSTEMS. WE EXPECT THE ORBITAL CONFIGURATIONS OF BINARY SYSTEMS TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE DEFINITION OF HABITABLE ZONES. METHODS THIS RESEARCH WILL CONSTRAIN THE HZ FOR PLANETS IN BINARY SYSTEMS BY USING A HIERARCHY OF EXISTING CLIMATE MODELS. WE WILL USE OBSERVED STELLAR SPECTRA AND STELLAR EVOLUTIONARY MODELS TO DEVELOP SEVERAL SCENARIOS FOR THE COMBINED SED OF BOTH P-TYPE AND S-TYPE BINARY SYSTEMS. WE WILL FIRST STUDY THE EFFECT OF SUPERPOSITION OF MULTIPLE STELLAR SPECTRA USING A LINE-BY-LINE RADIATIVE TRANSFER MODEL. THESE CALCULATIONS WILL SET BENCHMARKS FOR EVALUATION OF THE CORRELATED-K RADIATIVE TRANSFER CODES USED SUBSEQUENTLY. WE WILL THEN EVALUATE THE HZ FOR BINARY SYSTEM IN COMBINATIONS OF F, G, K, AND M TYPES USING A ONE-DIMENSIONAL RADIATIVE CONVECTIVE CLIMATE MODEL, WHICH WILL PROVIDE A BASIS OF COMPARISON AGAINST CLASSIC SINGLE-STAR HZ CALCULATIONS IN THE LITERATURE. WE WILL NEXT USE THIS 1-D MODEL TO PARAMETERIZE THE RADIATIVE TRANSFER IN A 2-D LATITUDINAL ENERGY BALANCE MODEL, WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO CONSIDER THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO HABITABILITY OF NON-CIRCULAR ORBITS AND ICE-ALBEDO FEEDBACK. WE WILL THEN EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF BINARY SED ON ATMOSPHERIC DYNAMICS BY USING FULL THREE-DIMENSIONAL GENERAL CIRCULATION MODELS TO QUANTIFY CHANGES IN LARGE-SCALE CIRCULATION THAT AFFECT HABITABILITY. BY USING THESE 3-D MODELS, WE CAN SELF-CONSISTENTLY SIMULATE ALL ASPECTS OF CLIMATE, WHICH INCLUDES GEOPHYSICAL AND ORBITAL PROPERTIES, RADIATIVE TRANSFER, DYNAMICS, AND CLOUDS. RELEVANCE THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH IS RELEVANT TO NASA S HABITABLE WORLDS PROGRAM AS A THEORETICAL STUDY OF THE CLIMATES OF EXTRASOLAR TERRESTRIAL PLANETS AND THEIR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN THE PRESENCE OF WATER. THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH WILL HELP  TO IDENTIFY THE CHARACTERISTICS AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF POTENTIALLY HABITABLE ENVIRONMENTS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND BEYOND  (C.4-1) BY USING A HIERARCHY OF EXISTING CLIMATE MODELS TO CONSTRAIN THE HZ OF PLANETS IN BINARY STAR SYSTEMS. THE SCOPE OF THIS RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE HABITABILITY OF EXTRASOLAR PLANETS, SO THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT RELEVANT TO THE EMERGING WORLDS PROGRAM, THE EXOBIOLOGY PROGRAM, OR ANY EXISTING DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAMS."

THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO SUPPORT WORK ON A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR THE CHARACTERIZATION AND INTERPRETATION OF HABITABILITY AND BIOSIGNATURES FOR PLANETARY BODIES WITHIN AND BEYOND THE SOLAR SYSTEM. THIS FRAMEWORK MOVES BEYOND A BINARY CHARACTERIZATION OF THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF LIQUID WATER, OR WHETHER A PUTATIVE BIOSIGNATURE IS BIOTIC OR ABIOTIC. INSTEAD, THE EFFORT SEEKS TO CHARACTERIZE THE DEGREE OF HABITABILITY OF DIFFERENT PLANETARY ENVIRONMENTS BY CONSIDERING OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR LIFE, AND AIMS TO ASSESS THE ABILITY OF A BIOSPHERE TO PRODUCE DETECTABLE BIOSIGNATURES AFTER CONSIDERING ENERGY LIMITATIONS ON PRODUCTIVITY, AS WELL AS BIOSIGNATURE DEGRADATION PROCESSES. BUT HOW WERE THESE BIOSIGNATURES EMPLACED INITIALLY? TO ADDRESS THIS, THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO FURTHER SUPPORT RESEARCH ON HOW EVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES CAN ALLOW LIFE TO EMERGE AND THEN EXPAND TO DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS? EVOLUTION THAT DRIVES INANIMATE MATTER TO BECOME ANIMATE HAS TO BE OPEN-ENDED, I.E. CONTINUALLY PRODUCE NOVEL AND ADAPTIVE FORMS. ALSO, ANY FORM OF LIFE THAT CANNOT LIBERATE ITSELF FROM THE INITIAL PREBIOTIC NICHE IS UNLIKELY TO SURVIVE.

HOW THIS HAPPENS REMAINS LARGELY UNKNOWN.

HOWEVER, NATURALLY OCCURRING􀁅COMMON􀁅 ABIOTIC SYNTHETIC PROCESSES THAT TAKE PLACE TODAY OR IN THE EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM WERE GENERALLY ASSUMED TO PRODUCE ONLY RACEMIC MIXTURES, WHICH ARE EQUAL AMOUNTS OF ENANTIOMERS. THE FACT THAT LIFE ON EARTH HAS STRICT HOMOCHIRALITY MIGHT IMPLY THAT, VERY EARLY, THERE WERE UBIQUITOUS AND DETERMINING PHYSICAL FORCES THAT DIRECTED THE DIRECTION OF ENANTIOMER EXCESSES IN ORGANIC BIOPOLYMERS (E.G., THEY PREFERENTIALLY AIDED THE SYNTHESIS OF \L\"" AMINO ACIDS AND \""D\"" SUGARS). HOWEVER, THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF EXPERIMENTS THAT ATTEMPT TO CREATE ENANTIOMER EXCESSES BEGIN WITH PRE-MADE (PRE-SYNTHESIZED) PAIRS OF ENANTIOMERS, E.G., THE SLIGHT PREFERENTIAL DESTRUCTION OF ONE ENANTIOMER BY RIGHT OR LEFT CIRCULARLY POLARIZED LIGHT (FLORES, BONNER, AND MASSEY 1977, JACS). LIKEWISE, RESEARCH ON COMBINED MAGNETISM PLUS RADIATION (PHOTO-MAGNETIC) EFFECTS HAS SO FAR BEEN APPLIED (MOSTLY THEORETICALLY) TO INORGANIC COMPLEXES (ALSO ASSUMING PRE-EXISTING ENANTIOMERS), RESULTING IN THE PRODUCTION OF VERY SMALL (#tilde# 10-4) EXCESSES BETWEEN ENANTIOMERS (RIKKEN AND RAUPACH, 2000, NATURE). HOWEVER, WE PROPOSE THAT PHOTO-MAGNETIC EFFECTS DURING ACTUAL SYNTHETIC REACTIONS (FORMOSE-LIKE REACTIONS) MIGHT BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING SIGNIFICANT ENANTIOMER EXCESSES. THE PRODUCTS OF THESE REACTIONS WOULD BE BIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT ORGANIC COMPOUNDS: SUCH REACTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT ON THE EARLY EARTH AND OTHER SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES. PRELIMINARY RESULTS GIVE HINTS OF THIS POSSIBILITY. THIS PROPOSED WORK WOULD UTILIZE LABORATORY SIMULATIONS, ORGANIC ANALYSES AND COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY (MAGNETIC EFFECTS ON ORGANIC COMPOUNDS) TO INVESTIGATE THE SCENARIO THAT RADIATION AND MAGNETISM MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE EARLY GENERATION OF ENANTIOMER EXCESSES LIKELY REQUIRED FOR SUBSEQUENT LIFE. THE MAJOR ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES WILL INCLUDE CHIRAL ANALYSES BY GAS CHROMATOGRAPHYMASS SPECTROMETRY (GC-MS), LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY-MS AND POLARIMETRY.

IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT PREBIOTIC HOMOCHIRALITY, OR AT LEAST SIGNIFICANT ENANTIOMER EXCESSES, MIGHT HAVE BEEN A NECESSARY PRECURSOR OF NUCLEIC ACIDS. IN LABORATORY MODEL SYSTEMS, NUCLEIC ACID POLYMERS DO NOT FORM TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT IF THEIR MONOMER BUILDING BLOCKS ARE RACEMIC, E.G., G. JOYCE ET AL., 1984, PNAS. SUCH RESULTS MIGHT IMPLY THAT REPLICATING MOLECULES (AS WE KNOW THEM) REQUIRED NEAR-HOMOCHIRAL BUILDING BLOCKS. OUR PROPOSED RESEARCH MAY AT LEAST REVEAL A POSSIBLE MECHANISM OF CREATING ENANTIOMER EXCESSES IN SUCH PRECURSORS DURING THE ACTUAL SYNTHESIS OF COMPOUNDS FROM REALISTIC AND WIDELY AVAILABLE PREBIOTIC MOLECULES."""

THE DEVELOPED DESIGN CONSISTS OF THREE MODULES: A COGNITIVE ENGINE, A SOFTWARE-DEFINED RADIO (SDR)PLATFORM AND A RECONFIGURABLE RF FRONT-END. THE KEY MODULE THAT MAKES THE RADIO A WACR IS THE COGNITIVE ENGINE THAT ACTS AS THE BRAIN OF THE SYSTEM. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE II PROJECT IS TO PROTOTYPE A SPACE TELECOMMUNICATIONS RADIO SYSTEM (STRS)-COMPLIANT PLUG-N-PLAY COGNITIVE ENGINE, CALLED THE RADIOBOT 1.0, THAT CAN TRANSFORM ANY SUITABLY DESIGNED SDR IN TO A WACR. DURING PHASE II, BLUECOM WILL BUILD ON THE SUCCESS OF PHASE I TO DEVELOP A SUITE OF ALGORITHMS THAT WILL MAKE UP THE COGNITIVE ENGINE: ALGORITHMS FOR SPECTRUM KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITIONAND PROTOCOLS FOR COGNITIVE COMMUNICATIONS. THE LATTER WILL SPECIFICALLY BE AIMED AT NETWORKS FORMED BY CLUSTERS OF SMALLER SATELLITES SUCH AS CUBESATS. NEXT, THESE ALGORITHMS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ON AN FPGA SYSTEM-ON-CHIP (SOC). RADIOBOT 1.0 PROTOTYPE WILL BE COMPLETED BY DEVELOPING A PLUG-N-PLAY INTERFACE BETWEEN THE FPGA-IMPLEMENTED COGNITIVE ENGINE AND ANY STRS-COMPLIANT SDR. WACR TECHNOLOGY OPERATION WILL BE DEMONSTRATED BY INTEGRATING THIS RADIOBOT 1.0 COGNITIVE ENGINE WITH SUITABLE SDR PLATFORMS AND IN PARTICULAR THOSE THAT OPERATE IN KA BAND. BEYOND OBVIOUS BENEFITS TO NASA IN REALIZING AUTONOMOUS AND INTELLIGENT COMMUNICATION NETWORKS REQUIRED TO EXPLOIT THE FULL POTENTIAL OF NETWORKED CLUSTERS OF CUBESATS, RADIOBOT1.0 WILL ALSO FIND COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS IN FIRST-RESPONDER/EMERGENCY/PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS, AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS AND DRONES AS WELL AS MANY OTHER MILITARYCOMMUNICATIONS."

THE PRIMARY GOAL OF OUR PHASE II EFFORT IS TO DEVELOP AND DELIVER A SOLUTION THAT ENABLES INTUITIVE TELE-ROBOTIC CONTROL IN DYNAMIC SCENARIOS, SUCH AS WHEN TARGETS AND POSSIBLY INTERFERING OBJECTS ARE MOVING IN THE WORKSPACE. THIS PROPOSED APPROACH COMBINES 3D SENSING AND NOVEL MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS WITH SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION AND MAPPING (SLAM) FOR WORKSPACE VISUALIZATION SLAM, TO OBTAIN REAL-TIME TRACKING THAT PROVIDES PILOT GUIDANCE. BY INCREASING SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND IMPLEMENTING SAFETY FEATURES SUCH AS COLLISION-AVOIDANCE, DCS CAN GARNER PILOT TRUST, IMPROVE SAFETY, MITIGATE TRAINING TIME AND SUPPORT RAPID TASK SWITCHING.

THE PRESENCE OF FELSIC AND ALKALINE COMPOSITIONS ON MARS INDICATES THAT THESE MAGMATIC PROCESSES LIKELY OCCURRED IN THE MARTIAN INTERIOR AND THUS MARS MIGHT BE GEOLOGICALLY MORE SIMILAR TO EARLY AND MODERN EARTH THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. HOWEVER, THE MAGMATIC PROCESSES THAT COULD HAVE FORMED THE MARTIAN FELSIC AND ALKALINE COMPOSITIONS HAVE NOT BEEN WELL CONSTRAINED. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO USE THERMODYNAMICAL MODELING TO RECONSTRUCT THE COMBINATION OF MAGMATIC PROCESSES AND CONDITIONS   SUCH AS MAGMA SOURCES, PARENT MAGMAS, PARTIAL MELTING, AND FRACTIONAL CRYSTALLIZATION   THAT FORMED THE ALKALINE AND FELSIC IGNEOUS ROCKS OBSERVED IN GALE CRATER AND COMPARE THEM TO SIMILAR COMPOSITIONS PREVIOUSLY ANALYZED AT THE MARTIAN SURFACE, METEORITES RECOVERED ON EARTH, AND TERRESTRIAL IGNEOUS ROCKS. ULTIMATELY, THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL HELP BETTER CONSTRAIN THE FORMATION OF FELSIC AND ALKALINE ROCKS OBSERVED AT GALE CRATER AND MORE BROADLY ON MARS OVERALL, AND HOW THEY RELATE TO SIMILAR TERRESTRIAL COMPOSITIONS. CONSTRAINING THESE MAGMATIC PROCESSES WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF THE MARTIAN CRUST (PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT TO BE ONLY BASALTIC) AND MANTLE, AS WELL AS CONTRASTING THE CRUSTAL EVOLUTION OF MARS WITH OUR OWN PLANET IN ORDER TO ELUCIDATE PLANETARY PROCESSES THAT RESULTED IN CRUSTAL EVOLUTION."

MARTIAN METEORITES ARE THE ONLY SOURCE MATERIAL FROM MARS AVAILABLE FOR STUDY WITH TERRESTRIAL LABORATORY PRECISION AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION. AS SUCH, THEY REPRESENT A FUNDAMENTAL SUITE OF ROCKS FOR CONSTRAINING THE GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF MARS. SHERGOTTITES, THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF MARTIAN METEORITES, ARE DIVIDED INTO THREE PETROLOGIC SUB-GROUPS: OLIVINEPHYRIC, BASALTIC, AND POIKILITIC. THE FOCUS OF THIS STUDY ARE THE POIKILITIC SHERGOTTITES. THEY ARE GABBROIC INTRUSIVE ROCKS THAT LIKELY REPRESENT A MAJOR LITHOLOGY OF THE MARTIAN CRUST. THE TERM POIKILITIC REFERS TO THEIR UNIQUE TEXTURE AMONGST THE MARTIAN METEORITES, WHICH CONSISTS OF TWO DOMAINS (FIG. 1): (DOMAIN 1) LARGE PYROXENE GRAINS (OIKOCRYST GRAINS) WITH INCLUSIONS OF PREVIOUSLY CRYSTALLIZED MINERALS, WHICH ARE FORMED EARLY IN THE MAGMA EVOLUTION AT THE BASE OF THE CRUST, AND (DOMAIN 2) INTERSTITIAL MATERIAL ENCLOSING THESE LARGE GRAINS, WHICH CRYSTALLIZED NEAR THE SURFACE AFTER ASCENT THROUGH THE CRUST. THESE TEXTURES ARE BELIEVED TO RESULT FROM SLOW MAGMA COOLING IN A DEEP RESERVOIR FOLLOWED BY RAPID COOLING LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH EMPLACEMENT AS HYPABYSSAL OR VOLCANIC ROCKS. THE POIKILITIC SHERGOTTITES RECORD IN THEIR CHEMISTRY TWO GEOCHEMICAL RESERVOIRS ENRICHED AND INTERMEDIATE DEFINED BY THEIR INCOMPATIBLE ELEMENT COMPOSITIONS AND COMPOSITIONS OF RADIOGENIC SR, ND, AND HF ISOTOPES. THE TWO DOMAINS IN BOTH ENRICHED AND INTERMEDIATE POIKILITIC SHERGOTTITES ALLOW US TO INVESTIGATE THE EVOLUTION OF THEIR PARENTAL MAGMA FROM THE CRUST/MANTLE BOUNDARY TO SHALLOW LEVELS, AS WELL AS POSSIBLE CRUSTAL CONTAMINATION. THE CURRENT MAJOR UNKNOWNS OF MARTIAN SHERGOTTITE MAGMATISM INCLUDE: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN METEORITE TEXTURES AND THEIR CONDITIONS OF CRYSTALLIZATION, MAGMA MANTLE/CRUSTAL INTERACTIONS, PETROGENETIC CONNECTIONS (OR NOT) BETWEEN SHERGOTTITES, AND ORIGIN OF SHERGOTTITE SOURCES. BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE BIMODAL TEXTURE, THEIR HIGH ABUNDANCES, AND THEIR DIFFERENT SOURCE RESERVOIRS, WE AIM TO USE THE POIKILITIC SHERGOTTITE METEORITES TO ADDRESS THESE KEY PROBLEMS THAT REMAIN CONTENTIOUS IN THE ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF SHERGOTTITE MAGMAS. WE WILL ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY: (GOAL 1) INVESTIGATING FORMATION PROCESSES OF POIKILITIC SHERGOTTITES AND PETROGENETIC COMPARISON WITH OTHER SHERGOTTITES; (GOAL 2) CONSTRAIN PARENTAL MAGMA COMPOSITION OF POIKILITIC SHERGOTTITES, ITS EVOLUTION, AND POTENTIAL CRUSTAL CONTAMINATION; AND (GOAL 3) ASSESSING TIME OF FORMATION, SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION, AND SOURCES OF POIKILITIC SHERGOTTITES AND LINK WITH OTHER SHERGOTTITES. TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, THE PROPOSED WORK WILL BE DIVIDED INTO THREE ANALYTICAL TASKS. THESE TASKS ARE EACH DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE THREE MAJOR INVESTIGATIVE GOALS. TASK 1, A COMPREHENSIVE PETROLOGIC STUDY OF POIKILITIC SHERGOTTITES, IS PLANNED, WHICH INCLUDES DETAILED IN SITU MAJOR AND TRACE ANALYSIS OF MINERALS IN TEXTURAL DOMAINS 1 AND 2 IN ALL ENRICHED AND INTERMEDIATE POIKILITIC SHERGOTTITES (GOAL 1).

THE ANHYDROUS NATURE OF MERRILLITE HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN INTERPRETED AS EVIDENCE OF WATER-LIMITED LATE-STAGE MARTIAN MELTS.

THIS RAISES THE QUESTION AS TO WHY ANHYDROUS MERRILLITE WOULD FORM RATHER THAN WHITLOCKITE IN MELTS THAT WOULD HAVE HAD AVAILABLE H2O AT THE TIME OF PHOSPHATE CRYSTALLIZATION.

THIRDLY, WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE EVOLUTION OF A PLANET WHOSE ORBIT IS INITIALLY ALIGNED WITH RESPECT TO THE DISK, BUT MISALIGNED WITH RESPECT TO THE ORBIT OF THE BINARY. WE WILL STUDY HOW THESE PROCESSES RELATE TO OBSERVATIONS OF STAR-SPIN AND PLANET ORBIT MISALIGNMENT AND TO OBSERVATIONS OF PLANETS THAT APPEAR TO BE UNDERGOING KL OSCILLATIONS. FINALLY, WE WILL ANALYZE THE EVOLUTION OF MISALIGNED MULTI-PLANET SYSTEMS. THIS THEORETICAL WORK WILL INVOLVE A COMBINATION OF ANALYTIC AND NUMERICAL TECHNIQUES. THE AIM OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO SHED SOME LIGHT ON THE FORMATION OF PLANETS IN BINARY STAR SYSTEMS AND TO CONTRIBUTE TO NASA''S GOAL OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE ORIGINS OF EXOPLANETARY SYSTEMS."

ALMA, VLT) OF PROTOPLANETARY DISKS HAVE BEGUN TO REVEAL COMPLICATED STRUCTURE (E.G. SPIRAL ARMS, GAPS, RINGS ETC.). IN PRINCIPLE SUCH OBSERVATIONS CAN PROVIDE CONSTRAINTS ON DISK DYNAMICS, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME REVEAL THE PHYSICAL PROCESSES WHICH CONTROL THE PLANET FORMATION PROCESS. HOWEVER, THIS REQUIRES REALISTIC THEORETICAL MODELS OF DISK DYNAMICS, INCLUDING A PROPER TREATMENT OF MHD EFFECTS, DUST GROWTH, SETTLING, AND FEEDBACK, AS WELL AS ACCURATE RADIATIVE TRANSFER CALCULATIONS THAT CAN GENERATE SYNTHETIC IMAGES FOR COMPARISON TO DATA. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO COMPUTE SUCH MODELS. WE WILL CALCULATE THE MOST REALISTIC GLOBAL NUMERICAL MODELS OF PROTOPLANETARY DISKS AND DISK-PLANET INTERACTION TO DATE, COMPUTE SYNTHETIC IMAGES OF THE MODELS BASED ON A SELF-CONSISTENT TREATMENT OF THE DUST DYNAMICS IN THE DISK, AND COMPARE THESE MODELS TO INTERPRET EXISTING DATA AND TO PREDICT FUTURE OBSERVATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, WE WILL COMPARE OUR MODELS WITH OBSERVATIONS FROM EXISTING NASA SPACE MISSIONS (E.G. SPITZER, HERSCHEL), AND GROUND BASED TELESCOPES (E.G. ALMA, EVLA, VLT, SUBARU, GEMINI), AND WE WILL MAKE PREDICTIONS FOR FUTURE OBSERVATIONS. OVER YEARS, OUR TEAM HAS BEEN BUILDING TOOLS TO ACHIEVE SUCH GOALS. WE HAVE STUDIED NON-IDEAL MHD EFFECTS ON DISK TURBULENCE, DUST PARTICLE DYNAMICS IN GASEOUS DISKS, PLANET-DISK INTERACTION, AND OTHER ASTROPHYSICAL DISK RELATED PROBLEMS. NOW, ADOPTING NOVEL NUMERICAL TECHNIQUES IN OUR NEWLY DEVELOPED 3-D MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC (MHD) CODE ATHENA++, WE CAN FINALLY PUT ALL THESE PIECES TOGETHER AND CONSTRUCT FIRST-PRINCIPLE GLOBAL SIMULATIONS TO BE DIRECTLY COMPARED WITH OBSERVATIONS. WE PLAN TO USE THIS NEW CODE TO (1) STUDY HOW PROTOPLANETARY DISKS ACCRETE BY CARRYING OUT GLOBAL 3-D MHD SIMULATIONS INCLUDING ALL IMPORTANT NON-IDEAL MHD EFFECTS. (2) INCLUDE DUST PARTICLES AND YOUNG PLANETS IN OUR SIMULATIONS TO STUDY DUST DYNAMICS, PLANETESIMAL FORMATION, AND THE OBSERVATIONAL SIGNATURES OF YOUNG PLANETS IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS. SINCE MOST DISK EMISSION COMES FROM DUST, THIS STEP IS ESSENTIAL FOR CONNECTING SIMULATIONS WITH OBSERVATIONS. (3) POST PROCESS OUR GLOBAL 3-D SIMULATIONS WITH 3-D MONTE CARLO RADIATIVE TRANSFER CODES TO GENERATE OBSERVATIONAL SIGNATURES OF DISK TURBULENCE AND YOUNG PLANETS IN DISKS. COMPARISONS WITH CURRENT OBSERVATIONS AND PREDICTIONS FOR FUTURE OBSERVATIONS WILL BE MADE. THESE FIRST-PRINCIPLE CALCULATIONS (INCLUDING MHD EFFECTS, DUST-GAS DYNAMICS, AND RADIATIVE TRANSFER) WILL ADDRESS FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ON PROTOPLANETARY DISKS AND ALLOW US TO STUDY PLANET FORMATION PROCESSES IN DETAIL. THE PREDICTIONS FROM THESE SIMULATIONS WILL NOT ONLY BE COMPARED WITH OBSERVATIONS (E.G. ALMA) DIRECTLY, BUT ALSO SERVE AS A FOUNDATION FOR UNDERSTANDING PLANET FORMATION AND EXOPLANET PROPERTIES FOR FUTURE SPACE MISSIONS (E.G. JWST, WFIRST, TESS)."

HARRIS, UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA THE LIFE HISTORY AND SYSTEMS BIOLOGY OF FUNGAL-ALGAL MUTUALISMS EXTREMOPHILES ARE WIDELY RECOGNIZED AS ORGANISMS THAT CAN LIVE IN ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE INHOSPITABLE TO MOST FORMS OF LIFE. THESE ENVIRONMENTS OFTEN EXHIBIT EXTREMES OF TEMPERATURE AS WELL AS WATER AVAILABILITY, AND MAY ALSO FEATURE UNUSUALLY HIGH LEVELS OF RADIATION, METALS, ACIDS, AND OTHER TOXIC COMPOUNDS. ALTHOUGH THE BEST STUDIED EXAMPLES OF EXTREMOPHILES ARE PROKARYOTIC, AN INCREASINGLY DIVERSE ARRAY OF EUKARYOTIC FUNGI HAVE BEEN FOUND THAT THRIVE IN EXTREME COLD, DRY, SALTY, OR ACIDIC HABITATS. EXTREMOPHILIC FUNGI POSSESS A NUMBER OF ADAPTATIONS THAT ENABLE THE COLONIZATION OF HARSH ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING THE ACCUMULATION OF PROTECTIVE PIGMENTS, SIMPLIFIED CELLULAR MORPHOLOGIES, AND VERY SLOW GROWTH. NEVERTHELESS, THERE IS MUCH THAT REMAINS TO BE UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THE LIFE HISTORY AND SYSTEMS BIOLOGY OF THESE FUNGI. WE PROPOSE TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT EXTREMOPHILIC FUNGI ENGAGE IN MUTUALISTIC ASSOCIATIONS WITH ALGAE (OR CYANOBACTERIA) TO SUPPORT THEIR COLONIZATION OF EXTREME HABITATS. IN PARTICULAR, THESE  TRANSIENT SYMBIOSES  PROVIDE AN ACCESSIBLE SOURCE OF NUTRITION AND MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO STRESS TOLERANCE. WE WILL TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS BY PURSUING TWO SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES. FIRST, WE WILL USE IMAGE ANALYSIS AND MICROSCOPY TO DETERMINE THE RELATIVE TIMING OF EVENTS UNDERLYING THE MUTUALISTIC ASSOCIATION OF THE EXTREMOPHILE FUNGUS EXOPHIALA DERMATITIDIS WITH THE ALGA CHLORELLA SOROKINIANA. TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROFILING AND BIOCHEMICAL ANALYSES WILL BE USED TO INVESTIGATE THE RESPONSES OF EACH PARTNER AS THEY INTERACT. SECOND, WE WILL EMPLOY CULTURE-BASED AND META-GENOMIC APPROACHES TO ASSESS THE DIVERSITY OF FUNGI AND ALGAE THAT COLONIZE ROCK SURFACES IN A BOREAL BIOME (PRE-CAMBRIAN SHIELD). ISOLATED FUNGI AND ALGAE WILL BE SYSTEMATICALLY TESTED FOR THE CAPACITY TO ENGAGE IN MUTUALISTIC ASSOCIATIONS. OUR PROPOSED RESEARCH FALLS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE NASA EXOBIOLOGY PROGRAM EMPHASIS AREA  EARLY EVOLUTION OF LIFE AND THE BIOSPHERE . FOR EXAMPLE, OUR RESULTS WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE PHYSIOLOGY OF EXTREMOPHILIC MICROORGANISMS THAT ARE ADAPTED TO ENVIRONMENTS THAT SHARE FEATURES IN COMMON WITH EARLY EARTH (AND PERHAPS OTHER PLANETS). NOTABLY, WE EXPECT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE CELLULAR SYSTEMS OF INTERACTING FUNGI AND ALGAE EVOLVE IN RESPONSE TO THESE ENVIRONMENTS. IN ADDITION, OUR RESULTS WILL ALSO SHED LIGHT ON HOW THE COMPOSITION OF MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES AND THEIR CONSTITUENT INTERACTIONS IMPACTS THE GEOCHEMISTRY OF ROCK SURFACES. FOR OUR FIRST OBJECTIVE, WE HAVE A DEVELOPED A PROTOCOL FOR THE SUCCESSFUL CO-CULTIVATION OF E. DERMATITIDIS WITH C. SOROKINIANA. RNA-SEQ WILL BE USED TO GENERATE TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROFILES AT MULTIPLE STAGES OF CO-CULTIVATION. THESE PROFILES WILL BE CORRELATED WITH MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF FUNGAL MORPHOLOGY AS WELL AS BIOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF FUNGAL LIPIDS. IN TOTAL, WE EXPECT THESE EXPERIMENTS TO PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHT INTO THE STRATEGIES EMPLOYED BY EXTREMOPHILE FUNGI TO ACQUIRE NUTRIENTS IN ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF EARLY EARTH. FOR OUR SECOND OBJECTIVE, WE WILL SAMPLE EXPOSED ROCK OUTCROPS AT THREE SPECIFIC LOCATIONS IN THE PRE-CAMBRIAN SHIELD OF CANADA. A ROUTINE CULTURE-BASED SELECTION WILL BE USED TO RECOVER EXTREMOPHILIC FUNGI AND ALGAE (OR CYANOBACTERIA) FROM ROCK SURFACES AS WELL AS FROM PULVERIZED FRAGMENTS. DNA SEQUENCE ANALYSIS WILL BE USED TO ESTABLISH THE IDENTITY OF EACH ISOLATE. IN PARALLEL, DNA EXTRACTED FROM PULVERIZED ROCKS WILL BE SEQUENCED TO PROVIDE A META-GENOMIC OVERVIEW OF FUNGAL AND ALGAL COMMUNITIES. UP TO 50 DISTINCT FUNGAL AND ALGAL (OR CYANOBACTERIAL) ISOLATES WILL BE CO-CULTIVATED USING A MICROTITER PLATE FORMAT TO ASSESS THEIR CAPACITY TO ENGAGE IN MUTUALISTIC INTERACTIONS BASED ON ACCUMULATION OF BIOMASS AND PHYSICAL ASSOCIATION."

THIS ENERGY  TRANSFER TAKES THE FORM OF HEAT ACQUISITION, HEAT TRANSPORT, AND HEAT REJECTION. AN EFFECTIVE THERMAL CONTROL SYSTEM MUST PROVIDE THESE  THREE BASIC FUNCTIONS WHILE BEING MINDFUL OF THE OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND SPACECRAFT SYSTEM. AT THE HEART OF THIS ENERGY CONVERSION  IS INTERFACIAL HEAT TRANSFER ESPECIALLY THAT BETWEEN SOLIDS AND LIQUIDS/GASES, WHICH CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED USING NANOTECHNOLOGY-ENABLED FUNCTIONALIZED SURFACES.

WE WILL COMPARE THE NEW LUE MODEL TO OTHER MODELS, INCLUDING THE BENCHMARK MOD17 GPP PRODUCTS AND EMERGING GPP PRODUCTS FROM SOLAR-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE (SIF) METHODS (OCO2 SATELLITE SENSOR). 4.  USING THESE METHODS, WE WILL EVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GROWING SEASON LENGTH AND PRODUCTIVITY TO INVESTIGATE REPORTED BROWNING AND GREENING AND THEIR CAUSES AND IMPLICATIONS FOR DIFFERENT ECOSYSTEMS WITHIN THE ABOVE DOMAIN.  METHODS/TECHNIQUES: TO ACCOMPLISH THESE OBJECTIVES, WE WILL USE SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS COUPLED WITH GROUND VALIDATION TO INVESTIGATE CHANGING GROWING SEASON LENGTH AND ITS IMPACT ON THE CARBON BUDGET OF BOREAL AND ARCTIC REGIONS. A PRIMARY APPROACH WILL BE TO DEVELOP A NEW LIGHT-USE EFFICIENCY (LUE) MODEL OF ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY, BASED ON A NEW COMBINATION OF SATELLITE INDICES PROVIDED BY REPROCESSED MODIS PRODUCTS.

SIGNIFICANCE: THIS STUDY ADDRESSES THE ABOVE TOPICS OF REPORTED GREENING AND BROWNING OF NORTHERN ECOSYSTEMS, AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN THE SATELLITE NDVI RECORD. THESE SATELLITE NDVI OBSERVATIONS HAVE SUGGESTED POTENTIALLY LARGE CHANGES IN BOREAL AND ARCTIC CARBON BUDGETS, BIOGEOCHEMISTRY, SURFACE-ATMOSPHERE FEEDBACKS, AND DISTURBANCE REGIMES, BUT CAN ALSO BE SUBJECT TO MISINTERPRETATION DUE TO THE OVER-DETERMINED NATURE OF SATELLITE INDICES. BY UTILIZING THE FULL RANGE OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM MODIS PRODUCTS, WE WILL ENHANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES BEYOND WHAT IS POSSIBLE FROM EXITING NDVI-BASED METHODS ALONE, AND LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE MODELING EFFORTS AND SATELLITE SENSORS HAVING IMPROVED SENSITIVITY TO SUBTLE VEGETATION CHANGE AND ITS UNDERLYING FUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE.

COMPOSITES ARE MATERIALS THAT ARE COMBINATIONS OF TWO OR MORE ORGANIC OR INORGANIC COMPONENTS. ONE MATERIAL SERVES AS A \MATRIX,\"" WHICH IS THE MATERIAL THAT HOLDS EVERYTHING TOGETHER, WHILE THE OTHER MATERIAL SERVES AS REINFORCEMENT, IN THE FORM OF FIBERS EMBEDDED IN THE MATRIX.  A CRYOTANK IS A CONTAINER THAT CAN STORE VERY COLD LIQUIDS, IN THIS CASE LIQUID HYDROGEN.  THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO PROVIDE NEW AND INNOVATIVE CRYOTANK TECHNOLOGIES THAT ENABLE HUMAN SPACE EXPLORATION TO DESTINATIONS BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT SUCH AS THE MOON, NEAR-EARTH ASTEROIDS, AND MARS.  THE FOCUS OF THIS INITIAL 1-YEAR EFFORT IS TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOP THE COMPOSITE CRYOTANK TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRED FOR A HEAVY LIFT LAUNCH VEHICLE (SIMILAR TO THE SATURN V ROCKET USED TO LAUNCH APOLLO MISSIONS) BETWEEN 8.4 METERS AND 10.0 METERS IN DIAMETER.  THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL SERVE MULTIPLE CUSTOMERS INCLUDING NASA, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD), AND COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE COMPANIES.  FUTURE SPIN-OFF CAPABILITIES MAY INCLUDE LH2 CORE STAGES (1ST AND TYPICALLY LARGEST SECTION OF A ROCKET), IN-SPACE PROPULSION SYSTEMS (A PROPULSION SYSTEM IS A MACHINE THAT PRODUCES THRUST TO PUSH AN OBJECT FORWARD), ON-ORBIT PROPELLANT DEPOTS (A CACHE OF PROPELLANT THAT IS PLACED ON AN ORBIT ABOUT THE EARTH OR ANOTHER BODY TO ALLOW SPACECRAFT TO BE FUELLED IN SPACE), AND LIQUID OXYGEN (LOX) CRYOTANKS.    OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS, THERE HAVE BEEN A VARIETY OF COMPOSITE CRYOGENIC TANK PROGRAMS AT NASA AND THE AIR FORCE.  EACH OF THESE PROJECTS HAS HAD SOME SUCCESS BUT THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGES THAT HAVE MADE NASA RELUCTANT TO INCORPORATE THEM.  ONE OF THE GREATEST CHALLENGES THAT NASA FACES WHEN INCORPORATING ANY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY IS BRIDGING THE MID TECHNICAL READINESS LEVEL (TRL AS DEFINED BY HTTP://ESTO.NASA.GOV/FILES/TRL_DEFINITIONS.PDF) GAP BETWEEN EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND INCORPORATION INTO FLIGHT VEHICLES (ROCKETS).  THE INTENT OF THIS CONTRACT EFFORT IS TO PUSH THE TECHNICAL MATURITY OF COMPOSITE TANKS FURTHER BY BUILDING ON THE DEVELOPMENTS OF RECENT PROGRAMS.  NASAS MOST RECENT COMPOSITE CRYOTANK WAS DEVELOPED UNDER THE NEXT GENERATION LAUNCH TECHNOLOGY (NGLT) PROJECT.  THE COMPOSITE CRYOTANK TECHNOLOGIES AND DEMONSTRATION (CCTD) ALSO HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON NEW IMPROVEMENTS DEVELOPED BY COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE INTERNAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IR&D) ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS OF INTERNATIONAL AND ACADEMIC PARTNERS, AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.  BUILDING ON PAST COMPOSITE CRYOTANK SUCCESSES AND EVALUATING NEW STATE OF THE ART MATERIALS THROUGH EQUIVALENCY TESTING SHOULD ALLOW NASA TO REALIZE CONSIDERABLE MASS AND COST SAVINGS.  IN FISCAL YEAR 2011, NASA PLANS TO BEGIN A PROGRAM THAT FOCUSES ON INNOVATIVE IDEAS ENABLING NEW CAPABILITIES OR RADICALLY ALTERING OUR CURRENT APPROACHES TO SPACE SYSTEMS.  GAME CHANGING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS (GCDP) ARE INTENDED TO BE CAPABILITY-ORIENTED AND DIFFER FROM TRADITIONAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT METHODS THAT ADVANCE DISCIPLINE OR CORE KNOWLEDGE.  THE GOAL OF THE PLANNED GCDP IS TO MATURE TECHNOLOGIES IN PREPARATION FOR POTENTIAL SYSTEM LEVEL FLIGHT DEMONSTRATIONS THROUGH SIGNIFICANT GROUND-BASED TESTING AND/OR LABORATORY EXPERIMENTATION.  NASA WILL MANAGE THE COMPOSITE CRYOTANK TECHNOLOGIES AND DEMONSTRATION PROJECT WITHIN THESE GUIDELINES.    THE CCTD PROJECT WILL BE SPLIT INTO TWO PHASES.  THE CURRENT EFFORT DESCRIBED IN THIS SOW IS PHASE 1.     THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF PHASE 1 COULD RESULT IN NASA ISSUING A SEPARATE 2-YEAR CONTRACT FOR PHASE 2 IF FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE.  PHASE 2 WILL LIKELY INVOLVE THE CRITICAL DESIGN, ANALYSIS, AND MANUFA"""

TWO BOEING N+3 SUBSONIC ULTRA GREEN AIRCRAFT RESEARCH (SUGAR) CONFIGURATIONS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TBW''S. AT CRUISE FLIGHT CONDITIONS THE TBW MAY BE SUBJECT TO DESIGN REQUIREMENTS THAT DISTINGUISH THEM FROM MORE HIGHLY SWEPT WINGS. HIGH ASPECT RATIO, SHORT CHORD LENGTH AND RELATIVE THINNESS OF THE AIRFOIL SECTIONS ALL CONTRIBUTE TO RELATIVELY LOW WING TORSIONAL STIFFNESS. THIS MAY LEAD TO AEROELASTIC ISSUES SUCH AS AILERON REVERSAL AND LOW FLUTTER MARGINS. FURTHER, THE GEOMETRY OF A SWEPT WING NATURALLY PROVIDES STRONG STABILIZING AERODYNAMIC FORCES DUE TO WING BENDING DEFORMATION UNDER LOADS. LACKING THIS AERODYNAMIC STIFFENING, LOW SWEEP WINGS MAY EXHIBIT REDUCED DIVERGENCE MARGINS. IN ORDER TO COUNTERACT THESE ISSUES, HIGH ASPECT RATIO/LOW SWEEP WINGS MAY NEED TO CARRY ADDITIONAL STRUCTURAL WEIGHT TO PROVIDE HIGH TORSIONAL STIFFNESS.  ONE VERY ATTRACTIVE OPTION TO PROVIDE ROLL CONTROL IS TO INTENTIONALLY CREATE WING TWIST. THE NASA X-53 ACTIVE AEROELASTIC WING (AAW) AIRCRAFT DEMONSTRATED THIS CONCEPT IN FLIGHT TESTING. BOEING WAS LEAD CONTRACTOR ON X-53 SO WE FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRIMARY ADVANTAGE OF AAW IS THAT ADDITIONAL STRUCTURAL WEIGHT IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE HIGH TORSIONAL STIFFNESS, IN FACT THE ADDITIONAL WEIGHT IS DETRIMENTAL TO THE AAW APPROACH. HOWEVER, ROLL CONTROL BY AAW WORKS BEST IN A FAIRLY NARROW RANGE OF DYNAMIC PRESSURE WHEN FORCES GENERATED BY THE CONTROL SURFACE ACT THROUGH A MOMENT ARM TO OVERCOME THE TWIST STIFFNESS OF THE WING. AT LOWER DYNAMIC PRESSURE, THE TWIST LOADS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO GENERATE ENOUGH TWIST AND AT THE AILERON REVERSAL SPEED, THE AILERONS PROVIDE NO ROLL CONTROL AT ALL.  THE PROPOSED NOVEL CONTROL EFFECTOR IS A VARIABLE SWEEP RAKED WING TIP. AT HIGH SPEED THE WINGTIP IS IN THE RAKED (SWEPT BACK) POSITION PROVIDING DUAL, INDEPENDENT BENEFITS. THE DRAG REDUCTION BENEFIT OF A RAKED WINGTIP IS ACHIEVED, AND IN ADDITION THE CONTROL EFFECTOR(S) ARE MOVED WELL AFT OF THE WING TORSIONAL AXIS. THIS PROVIDES A MOMENT ARM FOR FORCES GENERATED BY THE CONTROL EFFECTOR TO APPLY WING TWIST AND ENABLE THE AAW EFFECT. AT LOW SPEED THE WINGTIP IS UNSWEPT. THIS MOVES THE AERODYNAMIC CENTER OF THE CONTROL SURFACE LOADS FORWARD TO LIE ON OR VERY NEAR THE WING TORSIONAL AXIS. THIS ALLOWS THE CONTROL SURFACE TO ACT VERY EFFECTIVELY AS A CONVENTIONAL AILERON BY PROVIDING ROLL CONTROL FORCES WHILE APPLYING MINIMAL TWIST LOADS TO THE WING.  A KEY ASPECT OF OUR CONCEPT IS THAT HIGH RATES NECESSARY FOR ROLL CONTROL CAN BE PROVIDED BY A HIGH RATE CONTROL EFFECTOR SUCH AS LEADING OR TRAILING EDGE FLAPS, CONFORMAL CAMBER CHANGE OF THE WINGTIP, AND/OR TWIST OF THE WINGTIP ITSELF. THE LARGE SCALE VARIABLE GEOMETRY (SWEEP) WILL CHANGE WITH FLIGHT CONDITION AND NEED MUCH LOWER RATE. VARIABLE GEOMETRY WILL LIKELY INCLUDE SWEEP CHANGE, BUT OTHER SHAPE CHANGES SUCH AS WINGTIP DIHEDRAL (WINGLETS) AND TWIST WILL ALSO BE INVESTIGATED.   BOEING HAS CAREFULLY SELECTED A SMALL, AGILE TEAM THAT INCLUDES VIRGINIA TECH FOR THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH TBW AIRCRAFT, AND NEXTGEN AERONAUTICS FOR THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH DEVELOPMENT OF MORPHING AIRCRAFT CONCEPTS. BOTH ARE TEAM MEMBERS ON THE BOEING SUGAR PHASE II PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM WILL DRAW DIRECTLY ON THE DESIGNS AND DATA GENERATED IN SUGAR PHASES I AND II. EACH OF THE THREE TEAM MEMBERS WILL DEVELOP A CONCEPT FOR VARIABLE GEOMETRY RAKED WINGTIPS BASED ON THEIR UNIQUE EXPERIENCE. ONE OF THESE CONCEPTS WILL BE SELECTED FOR A DETAILED PERFORMANCE INVESTIGATION INCLUDING EXTENSIVE EVALUATION OF AEROELASTIC RESPONSE. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS WILL BE CONSIDERED SUCH AS ACTIVE GUST LOAD ALLEVIATION, RIDE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND ACTIVE BUFFET ALLEVIATION. BOEING IS EXCITED ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF THIS SYNERGISTIC APPLICATION OF AAW AND ADAPTIVE STRUCTURES/MORPHING TECHNOLOGY TO BENEFIT HIGH SPAN LOW WING SWEEP CONFIGURATIONS."

THESE DISTURBANCES HAVE ALSO RESULTED IN REGIONAL CHANGES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF WATER IN THE HYDROLOGIC CYCLE (E.G. PRECIPITATION, SOIL MOISTURE, SNOW WATER STORAGE, AND RUNOFF). MANY MUNICIPALITIES AND AGRICULTURE ARE RELIANT UPON WATER RESOURCES (TYPICALLY SNOWMELT FROM MOUNTAIN DRAINAGES) FROM WESTERN US SEMI-ARID WATERSHEDS.

TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE THIS SCENARIO, WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE CAPACITY OF POPULATIONS OF RNA MOLECULES TO EVOLVE SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS. CURRENTLY, THE MOST THOROUGH APPROACH IS TO EVALUATE VAST LIBRARIES OF SEQUENCES USING NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING. BY ASSIGNING A RELATIVE ACTIVITY (FITNESS) TO EACH SEQUENCE, IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONSTRUCT EMPIRICAL FITNESS LANDSCAPES. THESE LANDSCAPES CAN BE IMAGINED IN THREE DIMENSIONS, WITH THE X-Y-PLANE REPRESENTING NUCLEOTIDE CHANGES (GENOTYPE SPACE), AND THE Z-AXIS REPRESENTING RNA FITNESS. HOWEVER, FOR A GIVEN RNA SEQUENCE, THIS FITNESS VALUE WILL CHANGE IF THE CONDITIONS OF THE EXPERIMENT CHANGE (ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE). IMPORTANTLY, ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES MAY PROMOTE ADAPTATION, FOR EXAMPLE, IF LOW FITNESS VALLEYS BECOME CROSSABLE WHEN THE LANDSCAPE CHANGES. IN THE ABSENCE OF MODERN CELLULAR LIFE, CHANGES IN THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSTANT AND UNBUFFERED. DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL FLUCTUATIONS FOR RNA FITNESS LANDSCAPES, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FITNESS LANDSCAPES AND CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT REMAINS UNDERSTUDIED. HERE, WE PROPOSE TO EVALUATE CHANGES IN RNA FITNESS LANDSCAPES ACROSS CHEMICAL GRADIENTS. WE WILL UTILIZE NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING AS A HIGH-THROUGHPUT BIOCHEMICAL ASSAY. WE WILL SPREAD SOME OF THE THROUGHPUT OVER MULTIPLE POINTS ON AN ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENT. WE WILL USE NON-LINEAR CURVE FITTING TO PARAMETERIZE THE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE OF RNA SEQUENCE LIBRARIES, AND USE COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES EVALUATE HOW THESE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSES CAN LIMIT, OR PROMOTE, RNA ADAPTATIONS, UNDER DIFFERENT EVOLUTIONARY SCENARIOS, SUCH AS FLUCTUATING ENVIRONMENTS. THIS RESEARCH WILL ADVANCE OUR ABILITY TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE THE CAPACITY OF RNA CENTERED LIFE TO ADAPT TO NEW AND CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS. METHODOLOGY AS A MODEL SYSTEM, WE WILL USE GROUP I RIBOZYMES. THESE RIBOZYME CAN CATALYZE A REVERSE-SPLICING REACTION THAT RESULTS IN A SUBSTRATE SEQUENCE BECOMING ATTACHED TO ITS 3 END. WE WILL USE THIS ATTACHED SEQUENCE TO SELECT MOLECULES THAT HAVE REACTED. BY COUNTING THE POPULATION FREQUENCY OF A SPECIFIC SEQUENCE BEFORE AND AFTER SELECTION, WE WILL CALCULATE RIBOZYME FITNESS. FOR OUR MODEL ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENT, WE WILL USE MAGNESIUM ION CONCENTRATION. GROUP I RIBOZYMES SHOW A SIGMOIDAL RESPONSE TO INCREASING MG2+ CONCENTRATION THAT CAN BE FIT BY THE HILL EQUATION. DIFFERENT VARIANTS SHOW MAGNESIUM DEPENDENT RESPONSES THAT DIFFER IN BOTH THE INFLECTION POINT AND THE HILL COEFFICIENT, BUT PREVIOUS WORK HAS BEEN LIMITED TO A FEW SEQUENCES. WE WILL CONSTRUCT A LIBRARY OF SEQUENCE NEIGHBORS, AND DETERMINE THE RELATIVE ACTIVITY OF EACH SEQUENCE UNDER 10 DIFFERENT MAGNESIUM CONCENTRATIONS THAT COVER THE EXPECTED RESPONSE CURVES. FOR EACH SEQUENCE VARIANT, WE WILL FIT THE MG2+ RESPONSE CURVE TO THE HILL EQUATION AND EXTRACT THE FIT PARAMETERS. WE WILL THEN MAP THESE PARAMETERS BACK TO SEQUENCE SPACE AND DETERMINE THE CHANGE IN MAGNESIUM DEPENDENCE CAUSED BY CHANGES IN THE NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE. WE DEVELOP EVOLUTIONARY SIMULATIONS TO PREDICT HOW POPULATIONS OF RNA MOLECULES WOULD ADAPT TO CONSTANT OR FLUCTUATING MAGNESIUM LEVELS. RELEVANCE THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL HELP UNDERSTAND  THE ORIGIN, EVOLUTION, DISTRIBUTION, AND FUTURE OF LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE , WHICH IS THE GOAL OF THE NASA EXOBIOLOGY PROGRAM (APPENDIX C.5). RNA MOLECULES ARE BELIEVED TO PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE ORIGINS AND EARLY EVOLUTION OF LIFE. AS SUCH, THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENTS WILL HELP ELUCIDATE THE ABILITY OF RNA CENTERED LIFE TO ADAPT TO NEW ENVIRONMENTS OR ENVIRONMENTAL FLUCTUATIONS. THE RIBOZYMES STUDIED ARE USED AS A MODEL OF MOLECULES THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ORIGINS AND EARLY EVOLUTION OF LIFE.

WE WILL USE SNOWEX􀁁S GROUND-BASED TERRESTRIAL LIDAR (TLS) AND AIRBORNE LIDAR FROM THE AIRBORNE SNOW OBSERVATORY (ASO) ALONG WITH SNOWEX SNOW PIT, SNOW TRANSECT, AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS, TO QUANTIFY THE IN- AND SUB-CANOPY SNOW DISTRIBUTION FROM FINE (INDIVIDUAL BRANCHES AND TREES) TO COARSE (LANDSCAPE) SCALES.

Q2. HOW DO IN- AND SUB-CANOPY SNOW DEPTH DISTRIBUTIONS CHANGE WITH CANOPY CHARACTERISTICS AND FORCING MECHANISMS (E.G. FROM WINDDOMINATED TO INTERCEPTION- AND LONGWAVE ABLATION-DOMINATED) AND HOW DO THESE RELATIONSHIPS/DISTRIBUTIONS CHANGE WITH SPATIAL SCALE? Q3. WHAT PARAMETERIZATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO IMPROVE HOW SNOW MODELS REPRESENT IN- AND SUB-CANOPY SNOW DISTRIBUTIONS ACROSS HETEROGENEOUS CANOPY CONDITIONS AND FORCING MECHANISMS? THE RESULTS OF THIS PROJECT AREA VITAL TO NASA􀁁S GLOBAL SNOW MISSION IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. FIRST OUR STUDY ADDRESSES THE KEY KNOWLEDGE GAP OF HOW WELL AND WITH WHAT UNCERTAINTY DO AIRBORNE TECHNIQUES CAPTURE IN- AND SUB-CANOPY SNOW DEPTH DISTRIBUTIONS ACROSS CANOPIES WITH DIFFERENT DENSITIES AND VARYING FORCING MECHANISMS.

CHANGES IN CLIMATE ARE LIKELY TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON THESE REGIONS. SHORT AND LONG-TERM IMPACTS OF POPULATION GROWTH AND CLIMATE VARIABILITY ARE REVEALED IN THE CHANGING VEGETATION COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE OF DRYLAND SYSTEMS. ALTERED FIRE REGIMES ARE TRANSFORMING NATIVE SHRUB-DOMINATED LANDSCAPES TO ANNUAL INVASIVE GRASSES, THUS PERPETUATING THE FIRE CYCLE. WOODY PLANT EXPANSION CAN LEAD TO CHANGES IN LANDSCAPE ECOHYDROLOGY, DEGRADATION OF SOIL NUTRIENTS, AND INCREASED FIRE RISK AT THE URBAN FRINGE. CONSEQUENTLY, TECHNIQUES TO QUANTIFY VEGETATION STRUCTURE AND PREDICT CHANGING VEGETATION STRUCTURAL PATTERNS IN DRYLAND SYSTEM UNDER FUTURE SCENARIOS ARE NECESSARY TO ADDRESS NUMEROUS QUESTIONS RELATED TO QUANTIFYING VULNERABILITIES TO AND RESPONSES OF GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES. FOR EXAMPLE, WILL WARMER TEMPERATURES AND HIGHER INTENSITY AND FREQUENCY FIRES IN CALIFORNIA S MEDITERRANEAN ECOSYSTEM CAUSE AN IRREVERSIBLE SHIFT FROM A SHRUBLAND-DOMINATED ECOSYSTEM TO ONE OF NON-NATIVE ANNUAL GRASSES AND EXOTIC WEEDS? SIMILARLY WILL THE SHRUBLAND-DOMINATED GREAT BASIN BE CONVERTED TO ANNUAL GRASSES AND HOW WILL THE CONVERSION RATE VARY WITH INTERANNUAL PRECIPITATION AND CLIMATE? CURRENT AND UPCOMING NASA MISSIONS WITH OBSERVATIONS AT MULTIPLE SPECTRAL, SPATIAL, AND TEMPORAL SCALES, COUPLED WITH ROBUST CALIBRATIONS AND VALIDATIONS, HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO HELP SOLVE THESE GLOBALLY RELEVANT QUESTIONS.  WE ADDRESS SUBELEMENT 2.2 OF THE NASA TERRESTRIAL ECOLOGY PROGRAM BY DEVELOPING NEW APPROACHES TO COMBINING LIDAR AND HYPERSPECTRAL DATASETS FOR THE PURPOSE OF QUANTIFYING VEGETATION STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION IN DRYLAND TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS USING ECOSYSTEM MODELING. OUR RESEARCH APPROACH IS TO COLLECT NEW AIRBORNE LIDAR AND HYPERSPECTRAL DATASETS OVER A CLIMATE AND ELEVATION GRADIENT OF THE GREAT BASIN WHERE THE RESEARCHERS HAVE EXISTING FIELD, HYPERSPECTRAL, AND LIDAR DATASETS. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION IS TO SYNTHESIZE EXISTING AND NEW GROUND AND AIRBORNE DATASETS TO QUANTIFY METRICS SUCH AS HEIGHT, COVER, BIOMASS AND LAI. RESULTS WILL BE USED TO PARAMETERIZE ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY MODELING IN DRYLAND SYSTEMS AND WILL PROVIDE A BASIS FOR INVESTIGATING FEEDBACK MECHANISMS RELATED TO CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS, FIRE REGIMES AND PATTERNS OF NON-NATIVE PLANT INVASION. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL INITIALIZE THE ECOSYSTEM DEMOGRAPHY MODEL WITH ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION RETRIEVED FROM THE REMOTELY SENSED DATASETS IN A WAY THAT EXPLICITLY ACCOUNTS FOR THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE RETRIEVED INFORMATION. THE OVERARCHING QUESTIONS WE SEEK TO ANSWER IN THIS STUDY ARE: 1) WHAT ARE THE BEST DATA FUSION APPROACHES TO QUANTIFY ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE AND WHAT ARE THE ERRORS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE APPROACHES ACROSS MULTIPLE SCALES? 2) TO WHAT EXTENT DO LIDAR AND HYPERSPECTRAL SENSORS REVEAL THE SAME PLANT STRUCTURE INFORMATION AND TO WHAT EXTENT ARE THEY COMPLEMENTARY? 3) WHAT ARE THE COMPOSITIONAL AND SPATIAL CHANGES IN VEGETATION STRUCTURE WITH DISTURBANCE REGIMES OF CLIMATE, FIRE AND INVASIVE SPECIES?   WE WILL DEVELOP REGIONALLY SCALED LIDAR / HYPERSPECTRAL VEGETATION PRODUCTS IN ANTICIPATION OF A NEED TO DETERMINE HOW BEST TO ASSIMILATE THE GROWING NUMBER OF THESE SITE-LEVEL COLLECTIONS (G-LIHT (GSFC), CARNEGIE AIRBORNE OBSERVATORY, NEON AOP), WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY BE LINKED TO SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS. THIS FOUNDATIONAL WORK WILL PROVIDE A BASIS FOR EVALUATING THE EXTENT TO WHICH NEW AND FUTURE SATELLITE MISSIONS ARE SUITABLE FOR CHARACTERIZING DRYLAND VEGETATION STRUCTURE (I.E., LDCM, NPP-VIIRS, HYSPIRI, LIST, ICESAT-2). IMPORTANTLY, THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ECOSYSTEM COMPOSITION AND FUNCTION ON RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND 3D VEGETATION STRUCTURE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY SCIENCE STUDY GROUPS (E.G., HYSPIRI MISSION) AND SCIENTIFIC PANELS (E.G., NRC DECADAL SURVEY) AS HIGH SCIENCE PRIORITIES."

DIFFICULTIES OF ESTIMATING WATER VOLUMES STORED IN SNOW ARE WELL DOCUMENTED. IN SITU MEASUREMENT OVER LARGE AREAS IS CHALLENGING BECAUSE STANDARD TECHNIQUES ARE TIME CONSUMING, WHILE CORRELATION LENGTHS OF SNOW PROPERTIES ARE ON THE ORDER OF 100 M. LONG-TERM SNOW MONITORING NETWORKS REQUIRE A LONG HISTORICAL RECORD TO BE MEANINGFUL FOR STREAMFLOW PREDICTION, AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO AVERAGE REGIONAL SNOW CONDITIONS CAN BE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN, ESPECIALLY IN A CHANGING CLIMATE. REMOTE SENSING IS AN ATTRACTIVE COMPLEMENT TO IN SITU MEASUREMENTS THAT HAS RECEIVED CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION AT A VARIETY OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FREQUENCIES (E.G., MICROWAVE, VISIBLE/INFRARED, LIDAR) AND SPATIOTEMPORAL SCALES. AT VERY LARGE SCALES, MOREOVER, GRAVIMETRIC TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN APPLIED. EACH TECHNIQUE FOR REMOTE SENSING OF SNOW IS ASSOCIATED WITH WEAKNESSES THAT LIMIT THEIR APPLICABILITY ACROSS ALL GEOGRAPHIC SETTINGS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO FURTHER ADVANCE FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE EVOLUTION OF SEASONAL SNOWPACKS IMPACTS REMOTE SENSING OF SNOW AT DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS. IN THIS PROJECT WE FOCUS ON RETRIEVAL OF SWE AT HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTIONS USING MULTIPLE-FREQUENCY MICROWAVE RADAR, LEVERAGING FREQUENCIES ALREADY USED FOR WATER CYCLE REMOTE SENSING. IN PARTICULAR, WE WILL SIMULTANEOUSLY USE INFORMATION FROM HIGHER FREQUENCIES IDEAL FOR DRY SNOW INFORMATION, LOWER FREQUENCIES THAT RESPOND TO SOIL MOISTURE, AND INTERMEDIATE FREQUENCIES THAT ARE SENSITIVE TO BOTH SWE AND SOIL MOISTURE. THIS APPROACH ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM OF WATER STORAGE IN BOTH SNOW AND SOIL AS A JOINT RETRIEVAL PROBLEM. THE OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS OF THIS RESEARCH IS THAT, WHEN USED IN A DATA ASSIMILATION (DA) FRAMEWORK, ACTIVE MICROWAVE OBSERVATION OF SOIL MOISTURE CAN IMPROVE SWE RETRIEVAL (AND VICE VERSA). WE WILL LEVERAGE EXPERTISE IN LAND SURFACE MODELING AND DATA ASSIMILATION, ACTIVE MICROWAVE REMOTE SENSING, FIELD DATA COLLECTION, AND GEOPHYSICAL INVERSE THEORY. WE WILL COLLECT UNIQUE AND HIGHLY TEMPORALLY RESOLVED, ULTRA BROADBAND FREQUENCY MODULATED CONTINUOUS WAVE (FMCW) RADAR DATA AT TWO INTENSIVELY STUDIED FIELD SITES WITH DIFFERENT SNOW COVER CHARACTERISTICS. TOGETHER WITH COINCIDENT FIELD MEASUREMENTS AT THE STUDY AREAS, WE WILL USE FMCW DATASETS TO ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE EVOLUTION OF SNOWPACK AND LAND SURFACE PROPERTIES IMPACTS MICROWAVE OBSERVATION ACROSS A RANGE OF FREQUENCIES THAT SPAN FREQUENCIES COMMONLY USED FOR EARTH REMOTE SENSING. WE WILL USE THESE DATASETS CONJUNCTIVELY TO BETTER PARAMETERIZE BOTH FORWARD GEOPHYSICAL MODELS OF MICROWAVE SCATTERING AND RETRIEVALS OF LAND SURFACE PROPERTIES FROM MICROWAVE OBSERVATIONS. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO USE LAND SURFACE MODELS TO SYNTHESIZE REALISTIC RADAR OBSERVATIONS AT L-, X-, AND KU-BANDS OVER LARGE REGIONS AND AT DIFFERENT SPATIAL RESOLUTIONS. WE WILL CONFIRM SYNTHESIZED OBSERVATIONS AGAINST EXISTING SATELLITE (E.G., TERRASAR-X) AND AIRBORNE (E.G., POLSCAT) DATA DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD NASA COLD LAND PROCESSES EXPERIMENTS (CLPX-II AND -III). THE ABILITY TO SYNTHESIZE REALISTIC ACTIVE MICROWAVE OBSERVATIONS WILL FACILITATE OBSERVING SYSTEM SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS (OSSES) TO INVESTIGATE IMPROVEMENTS IN SNOW STORAGE ESTIMATION THROUGH ASSIMILATING MULTIPLE-CHANNEL MICROWAVE OBSERVATIONS INTO MODELS. THESE OSSES ALLOW THE INVESTIGATOR TEAM TO DESIGN HYPOTHETICAL MISSIONS TO COMPLEMENT EXISTING SATELLITES TO ENHANCE  RETRIEVAL OF SNOW INFORMATION AND QUANTIFY TRADE SPACES RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF MICROWAVE FREQUENCY OF OBSERVATIONS ASSIMILATED, TEMPORAL REVISIT, SPATIAL RESOLUTION, AND OBSERVATIONAL ERROR."

A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IN STELLAR ASTROPHYSICS IS HOW STARS SHED THE BULK OF THEIR MASS AS THEY DIE. MUCH OF THIS MASS IS EJECTED DURING THE LPV PHASE OF STELLAR EVOLUTION. THAT MATERIAL, ENRICHED BY THE NUCLEOSYNTHETIC PRODUCTS CREATED DEEP IN A STARS INTERIOR, IS RECYCLED INTO THE INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM TO FORM THE NEXT GENERATIONS OF STARS AND PLANETS AND, OVER TIME, CHANGES THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE GALAXY. THE AMPLITUDE AND PERIOD DISTRIBUTION OF LPVS, AND HOW LONG THEY REMAIN IN THIS STAGE, PROFOUNDLY IMPACT THE TYPE AND AMOUNT OF ENRICHED MATERIAL THAT IS RETURNED TO THE ISM. HOWEVER, A PROFOUND IMPEDIMENT TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS IMPORTANT PHASE OF STELLAR EVOLUTION IS THE LACK OF AN UNBIASED SAMPLE FOR THE DISK OF THE MILKY WAY. RECENT VARIABILITY SURVEYS OF THE MAGELLANIC CLOUDS AND THE GALACTIC BULGE HAVE ACCURATELY COUNTED LPVS IN THOSE ENVIRONMENTS AS A FUNCTION OF LUMINOSITY, PULSATION MODE, AND PERIOD BUT NO SUITABLE COMPARISON EXISTS FOR THE GALACTIC DISK. CURRENT COUNTS OF GALACTIC LPVS ARE FROM HETEROGENEOUS COMPILATIONS OF COUNTLESS OBSERVING PROGRAMS, EACH WITH ITS OWN BIASES. CONSEQUENTLY, THE IMPACT OF THESE POPULATIONS OF EVOLVED STARS ON THEIR HOST GALAXIES AT SOLAR METALLICITIES REMAINS UNKNOWN.  OUR PROJECT WILL USE THE FFIS FROM THE KEPLER ARCHIVE TO ADDRESS THIS NEED BY CREATING THE FIRST UNBIASED CATALOG OF DISK LPVS AND ANALYZING THEIR PROPERTIES. THESE IMAGES OF THE ENTIRE 116 SQUARE DEGREE FIELD, TAKEN AT A CADENCE OF ABOUT ONCE EVERY 30 DAYS, MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE FIRST TIME TO CREATE AN UNBIASED DATABASE OF PULSATING, DYING STARS ON THE ASYMPTOTIC GIANT BRANCH IN THE DISK.

THIS WILL REQUIRE ADVANCING THE MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF HOW PHYSICAL (CANOPY ARCHITECTURE, VIEWING AND ILLUMINATION GEOMETRY) AND ECOPHYSIOLOGICAL (SEASONAL ACCLIMATION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND NEEDLE PIGMENT COMPOSITION) DRIVERS AFFECT TOP-OF-CANOPY SIF AND REFLECTANCE. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, WE WILL LEVERAGE THE STRENGTH OF BOTH SIF AND REFLECTANCE SYNERGISTICALLY TO INTERPRET THEIR RELATIONS TO GPP, AND DEPENDENCE ON OBSERVATION GEOMETRY. TOWARDS THIS GOAL, WE WILL INSTALL OUR TOWER-BASED SPECTROMETER SYSTEM AT A NEW SITE (DELTA JUNCTION, ALASKA), WHICH WILL BE AUGMENTED BY OUR EXISTING NETWORK, REPRESENTATIVE OF DIFFERENT CLIMATOLOGICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL REGIMES (SITES NIWOT RIDGE, COLORADO; SOUTHERN OLD BLACK SPRUCE, SASKATCHEWAN). THESE THREE EVERGREEN-DOMINATED SITES HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT CLIMATIC, RADIATIVE, AND HYDROLOGICAL REGIMES, WHICH ENABLES US TO CHARACTERIZE MUCH OF THE WIDE RANGE OF EVERGREEN ECOSYSTEMS IN THE ABOVE DOMAIN. TOWER-CANOPY AND AIRBORNE SPECTROSCOPY DATA WILL BE COUPLED WITH IN-SITU  MEASUREMENTS AND 3-D RADIATIVE TRANSFER MODELING TO LINK PROCESSES AT A RANGE OF SCALES TO REMOTE SENSING MEASUREMENTS. THIS MULTI-SCALE APPROACH WILL INFORM SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS FROM MODIS, OCO-2, AND TROPOMI, TO SCALE GPP ESTIMATES ACROSS THE BOREAL REGION. OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVES ARE AS FOLLOWS: 1) ESTABLISH A QUANTITATIVE FRAMEWORK TO DESCRIBE THE ECOPHYSIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL MECHANISMS LINKING SURFACE MEASUREMENTS OF SIF AND VEGETATION REFLECTANCE TO GPP AT ESTABLISHED TOWER SITES AND COINCIDENT AIRBORNE CAMPAIGNS. 2) REDUCE UNCERTAINTIES IN SATELLITE-BASED ESTIMATES OF GPP ACROSS THE BOREAL REGION BY APPLYING A PROCESS-BASED UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH THE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL DYNAMICS OF SIF AND VEGETATION REFLECTANCE AT FINE SCALES. THIS WORK DIRECTLY RESPONDS TO THE NASA ABOVE PHASE 2 CALL BY  IMPROVING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE STRUCTURE, FUNCTION, AND PRODUCTIVITY OF TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS AND THEIR INTERACTION WITH ATMOSPHERE AND HYDROSPHERE AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLING.  INTEGRATING OBSERVATIONS MADE AT MULTIPLE SCALES IS CRITICAL TO ELUCIDATE ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION AND WILL DIRECTLY INFORM OUR UNDERSTANDING OF  HOW VULNERABLE OR RESILIENT BOREAL ECOSYSTEMS ARE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE.  TO ACHIEVE THIS, WE WILL DIRECTLY EXAMINE \THE ECOPHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SURFACE AND SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS OF SIF FOR NORTHERN ECOSYSTEMS AND ITS LINK TO ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY.\"""""

THE NASA-SUPPORTED MISSIONS HAVE PRODUCED LONG AND ACCURATE DATASETS, WHICH PROVIDE AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY TO INVESTIGATE AND DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN GEOPHYSICAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO SURFACE DEFORMATION, INCLUDING TECTONIC MOTIONS AND THE REDISTRIBUTION OF SURFACE FLUIDS. THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IS DISPLACED IN ELASTIC RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN SURFACE MASS LOADS. SPATIAL GEODETIC OBSERVATIONAL TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS GPS, ACCURATELY MEASURE THE CRUSTAL LOADING DEFORMATION AT MILLIMETER-LEVEL ACCURACY. LOADING DEFORMATION DEPENDS ON BOTH SURFACE-LOAD MASS CHANGES AND THE ELASTIC PROPERTIES OF EARTH S INTERIOR. IF SURFACE-LOAD CHANGE CAN BE PRECISELY DETERMINED, THE RESIDUAL BETWEEN OBSERVED AND MODELED LOADING DEFORMATION MAY BE USED TO INVESTIGATE THE ELASTIC STRUCTURE OF THE EARTH. HERE, WE PROPOSE TO USE OBSERVATIONS OF MASS-LOADING RESPONSE IN THE GREAT LAKES REGION OF NORTH AMERICA TO PROBE THE ELASTIC STRUCTURE OF THE REGIONAL CONTINENTAL SHIELD. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBSURFACE STRUCTURE OF THE GREAT LAKES REGION IN THE NORTH AMERICAN PLATE IS IMPORTANT FOR ALL SOLID EARTH SCIENCES. PREVIOUS SEISMIC TOMOGRAPHY STUDIES INDICATE THAT CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PARTS OF NORTH AMERICA ARE UNDERLAIN BY A RELATIVELY COLD, CRATONIC KEEL EXTENDING TO DEPTHS OF MORE THAN 200 KM WITHIN THE MANTLE. A CONSPICUOUS FEATURE OF SOME RECENT MODELS IS A LOW-VELOCITY CHANNEL AT #tilde#200 KM DEPTH EXTENDING FROM THE EAST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA INTO THE LOWER GREAT LAKES REGION. THE DEVIATIONS OF THE REGIONAL EARTH STRUCTURE IN THE GREAT LAKES REGION FROM STANDARD GLOBALLY AVERAGED EARTH STRUCTURE WILL AFFECT THE EARTH S LOADING RESPONSE TO VARIATIONS IN SURFACE MASS. CORRECTLY CHARACTERIZING THE REGIONAL EARTH STRUCTURE WILL IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF THE NORTH AMERICAN PLATE. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL SYSTEMATICALLY ANALYZE GPS-OBSERVED LOADING DEFORMATION AROUND THE GREAT LAKES REGION, AND DEVELOP AN INVERSION STRATEGY TO BETTER CONSTRAIN THE EARTH STRUCTURE IN A CENTRAL REGION OF THE NORTH AMERICAN PLATE. CHANGES IN LAKE VOLUME ARE KNOWN RELATIVELY ACCURATELY BY WATER-LEVEL MONITORING STATIONS, SO WE WILL FOCUS ON LAKE-MASS CHANGES FOR THE TOMOGRAPHIC INVESTIGATIONS. ADDITIONAL LOADING SIGNALS, INCLUDING FROM THE ATMOSPHERE, OCEAN AND REGIONAL HYDROLOGY, WILL BE MODELED AND REMOVED PRIOR TO INVERSION FOR STRUCTURE. THE PROPOSED PROJECT CLOSELY MATCHES ESI S 2018 SOLICITATION WITH A FOCUS ON INNOVATIVE SOLID-EARTH SCIENCE: GEODETIC TOMOGRAPHY. THE PROPOSAL AIMS TO ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SOLID-EARTH PROCESSES AND PROPERTIES FROM CRUST TO CORE, WHICH IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE ESI PROGRAM, AND DIRECTLY ADDRESSES KEY SCIENTIFIC CHALLENGES HIGHLIGHTED BY THE ESI PROGRAM:  HOW DOES THE SOLID EARTH RESPOND TO CLIMATE-DRIVEN EXCHANGE OF WATER AMONG EARTH SYSTEMS AND WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR SEA-LEVEL CHANGE AND HOW DO TECTONIC PROCESSES AND CLIMATE VARIABILITY INTERACT TO SHAPE EARTH S SURFACE AND CREATE NATURE HAZARDS."

THE PROPOSED TRANSMITTER WILL ENABLE WIDESPREAD DEPLOYMENT OF OZONE DIAL SYSTEMS CAPABLE OF CONTINUOUS RANGE-RESOLVED ATMOSPHERIC OZONE MEASUREMENTS FROM GROUND-BASED AND AIRBORNE PLATFORMS TO ADVANCE NASA?S EARTH SCIENCE MISSION. TO ACHIEVE THIS DESIGN GOAL, BRIDGER WILL APPLY INNOVATIONS PROVEN OUT DURING ITS PHASE I EFFORT AND DEVELOPED PREVIOUSLY FOR ITS MIR SERIES LASER PRODUCT. THE OVERALL PROJECT GOAL IS TO DESIGN, CONSTRUCT, AND TEST AN AUTONOMOUS, PRODUCTION-GRADE PROTOTYPE, TWO-WAVELENGTH OZONE LIDAR TRANSMITTER. THE PROPOSED TRANSMITTER WILL ENABLE STATE-OF-THE-ART CONTINUOUS OZONE LIDAR MEASUREMENTS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR A SKILLED OPERATOR. IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE A LONG MAINTENANCE-FREE INTERVAL (>2 YEARS), AND WILL COST UNDER $200K PER TRANSMITTER. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PHASE II PROGRAM WILL ALLOW BRIDGER TO DEMONSTRATE A SIMULTANEOUS DIAL, BRASSBOARD TRANSMITTER WITH PULSE ENERGIES>200 ?J IN BOTH DIAL WAVELENGTHS CAPABLE OF AUTONOMOUS OPERATION, WITHOUT DEGRADATION, FOR 3 MONTHS."

IN SUCH A HIGH-RISK ENVIRONMENT, THE RISK OF SLEEPINESS-RELATED PERFORMANCE IMPAIRMENT MUST BE MINIMIZED. IT IS ALSO INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED THAT THE RESPONSE TO SLEEP LOSS AND CIRCADIAN DESYNCHRONY IS HIGHLY INDIVIDUALIZED AND BOTH CHALLENGE- AND TASK-DEPENDENT. THIS HIGH DEGREE OF INTER-INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHO WILL BE AT RISK AND WHEN THEY WILL BE AT RISK, AND THEREFORE A `ONE-SIZEFITS-ALL  APPROACH IS LIKELY TO BE SUBOPTIMAL. WHAT IS NEEDED ARE BIOMARKERS OF INDIVIDUAL VULNERABILITIES AND RESILIENCIES TO SLEEP LOSS AND CIRCADIAN DESYNCHRONIZATION THAT CAN BE USED TO PREDICT PROBLEMS AND INTERVENE WHEN NECESSARY. TO DATE, THERE ARE NO BIOMARKERS THAT ARE APPROVED TO DETERMINE INDIVIDUAL ASTRONAUTS  VULNERABILITIES TO SLEEP LOSS AND CIRCADIAN RHYTHM DISRUPTION, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY CANDIDATES TO TEST. IN A RECENT NASA EVIDENCE REVIEW ADDRESSING HRP SLEEP GAP4, WE IDENTIFIED AND EVALUATED APPROXIMATELY 80 POTENTIAL BIOMARKERS OF RESPONSE TO SLEEP LOSS OR CIRCADIAN DESYNCHRONY, RANGING FROM SIMPLE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENTS OF ALERTNESS THROUGH TO GENETIC POLYMORPHISMS. WHILE THERE ARE FEW DATA SPECIFICALLY CHARACTERIZING INDIVIDUAL RESPONSES TO SLEEP LOSS AND CIRCADIAN DESYNCHRONY, FORTUNATELY, MANY OF THESE BIOMARKERS HAVE BEEN STUDIED BY OUR RESEARCH GROUP IN DETAILED LABORATORY CONDITIONS OF THOUSANDS OF SUBJECTS OVER TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BED-DAYS IN FEDERALLY-FUNDED STUDIES, BUT HAVE NEVER BEEN EXAMINED WITH RESPECT TO INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES. FURTHERMORE, IN A PREVIOUS NASA-SUPPORTED STUDY (ROSES-2008), WE STUDIED 51 ANTARCTIC EXPEDITIONERS OVER 6 MONTHS DURING THE ANTARCTIC WINTER (MARCH TO SEPTEMBER) AT AUSTRALIAN ANTARCTIC STATIONS CASEY, DAVIS AND MAWSON (54% OF THE OVERWINTERING POPULATION). A LARGE NUMBER OF SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF STRESS, AFFECT, SAFETY, TEAM INTERACTIONS AND WELL-BEING WERE RECORDED, IN ADDITION TO SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTCOMES INCLUDING SLEEP, CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS, URINARY CORTISOL AND MELATONIN LEVELS, A RANGE OF NEUROCOGNITIVE PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES AND ALERTNESS. THE LARGE DATASET IS AVAILABLE TO TEST THE PREDICTIVE VALUE OF A RANGE OF BEHAVIORAL, PERFORMANCE, SLEEP AND CIRCADIAN BIOMARKERS ON NEUROCOGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND GOING FORWARD, WILL ALLOW OUR RESEARCH TEAM, IN COLLABORATION WITH HRP, TO SELECT ONLY THOSE MEASURES THAT YIELD SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION FOR FUTURE STUDY, AND WILL ALLOW CAPACITY TO ADD NEW MEASURES NOT YET ASSESSED UNDER THESE OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS. BASED ON THIS REVIEW, WE HAVE DEVISED A PROTOCOL TO ASSESS THE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF A CORE SET OF THESE BIOMARKERS TO PREDICT NEUROCOGNITIVE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO THE SLEEP DEPRIVATION AND CIRCADIAN MISALIGNMENT INHERENT IN ISS OPERATIONS. FIRST, WE WILL IDENTIFY CANDIDATE BIOMARKERS FROM OUR LABORATORY ANALOG, WHERE INDIVIDUALS ARE HOUSED IN INDIVIDUAL, SEMI-ISOLATED, WINDOW-LESS SUITES, AND FROM EXISTING EXTENSIVE LONGITUDINAL DATA IN OVER 50 ANTARCTIC EXPEDITIONERS. THESE, AND PREVIOUSLY UNTESTED BIOMARKERS, WILL THEN BE VALIDATED IN NEW LIMITED LABORATORY ANALOG STUDIES TO INFORM A NEW ANALOG STUDY THAT WILL TEST THE FEASIBILITY AND UTILITY OF A SET OF CORE BIOMARKERS TO PREDICT AND ASSESS VARIATION IN NEUROCOGNITIVE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION ASSOCIATED WITH LIVING IN ANTARCTICA DURING A 12-MONTH MISSION.

THE FSW MODEL WILL BE VALIDATED BY EXPERIMENTS, SUCH THAT TEMPERATURES, REACTIVE WELDING LOAD, AND WELDING TORQUE ARE ALL PREDICTED, SIMULTANEOUSLY, WITH REASONABLE ACCURACY (5%). INITIAL VALIDATION WILL BE WITH A SMOOTH TOOL. AFTER APPROPRIATE AGREEMENT ON A SMOOTH TOOL, A TOOL WITH A THREADED PIN WILL BE EMPLOYED IN THE MODEL AND VALIDATED BY EXPERIMENT. FINALLY, A SELF-REACTING FSW TOOL WILL BE MODELED AND VALIDATED BY EXPERIMENT. MODEL RESULTS WILL BE USED TO PREDICT MECHANICAL PROPERTIES IN THE HEAT AFFECTED ZONE OF THE WELD. THE PROPOSED APPROACH WOULD PROVIDE NASA WITH A METHOD FOR CHARACTERIZING INTERFACE BEHAVIOR FOR A GIVEN ALLOY AND TOOL MATERIAL. THIS INTERFACE BEHAVIOR IS ESSENTIAL TO ACCURATE MODELING. FSW MODELS USING ACCURATE INTERFACE BEHAVIOR WILL BE MORE PREDICTIVE AND USEFUL FOR THE RAPID OPTIMIZATION OF PROCESS PARAMETERS AND TOOL DESIGNS."""

BEGINNING WITHTHE FIRST DATA IN 1978 AND WITH CONTINUOUS DATA SINCE THE EARLY 1990S, SCATTEROMETER DATA COMPRISES THE LONGEST SCIENTIFIC DATA RECORD OF MICROWAVE RADAR BACKSCATTER MEASUREMENTS OF THE EARTH. THE SCATTEROMETER DATA SET PROVIDES AN UNPARALLELED RECORD FOR THE STUDY OF GLOBAL CLIMATE SYSTEMS. BOTH OCEAN WIND AND LAND/ICE APPLICATIONS OF SCATTEROMETER DATA BENEFIT FROM THE USE OF PROVEN RECONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES TO ENHANCE THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF THE BACKSCATTER MEASUREMENTS. SUCH ENHANCED RESOLUTION MEASUREMENTS ENABLE PRODUCTION ULTRA-HIGH RESOLUTION (UHR) 2.5-4.5 KM/PIXEL WIND PRODUCTS AND IMPROVE THE UTILITY OF SCATTEROMETER MEASUREMENTS IN LAND/ICE APPLICATIONS. UHR WINDS HAVE PROVEN VALUABLE IN OPERATIONAL SEVERE WEATHER FORECASTING, NEAR-COASTAL STUDIES, AND MESOSCALE WIND AND RAIN STUDIES. FURTHERMORE, RESOLUTION ENHANCEMENT CAN PROVIDE KEY INFORMATION ON MESOSCALE PROCESSES AFFECTING BOTH UHR AND CONVENTIONALRESOLUTION SCATTEROMETER WIND RETRIEVAL. RAIN IS A WELL-KNOWN LIMITATION OF SCATTEROMETER WIND RETRIEVAL. SIMULTANEOUS WIND/RAIN (SWR) RETRIEVAL AT UHR IMPROVES BOTH THE WIND AND RAIN RETRIEVAL SINCE THE SIZE OF RAIN CELLS ARE ON THE ORDER OF THE UHR WIND VECTOR CELLS. UHR RETRIEVAL MINIMIZES BEAMFILLING AND COREGISTRATION PROBLEMS BETWEEN THE WIND AND THE RAIN, AND THUS CAN RESULT IN MORE ACCURATE WIND ESTIMATES AS WELL AS MEASUREMENTS OF THE RAIN RATE. CONVENTIONAL-RESOLUTION SWR RETRIEVAL HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED AT BOTH KU- AND C-BAND. UHR SWR RETRIEVAL HAS BEEN VALIDATED AT KU-BAND, BUT FURTHER VALIDATION AT C-BAND IS NEEDED. CONVENTIONAL-RESOLUTION RAIN FLAGS CAN BENEFIT FROM INFORMATION DERIVED FROM UHR SWR RETRIEVAL. FOR EXAMPLE, THRESHOLDING UHR SWR RAIN ESTIMATES CAN IDENTIFY INDIVIDUAL SIGMA-0 MEASUREMENTS ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY RAIN. THESE MEASUREMENTS CAN BE EXCLUDED DURING WIND RETRIEVAL TO MINIMIZE ADVERSE RAIN IMPACT. NONTRADITIONAL APPLICATIONS OF SCATTEROMETER DATA OVER LAND AND ICE HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY VALIDATED IN VEGETATION CLASSIFICATION, SEA ICE EXTENT MONITORING, SEA ICE MOTION, SNOW AND ICE MELT ONSET/REFREEZE, SNOW COVER EXTENT, AND OPERATIONAL ICEBERG TRACKING. THESE STUDIES HAVE BENEFITED FROM THE COMPREHENSIVE SUITE OF ENHANCED- AND CONVENTIONAL RESOLUTION BACKSCATTER PRODUCTS PRODUCED BY THE PIS SCATTEROMETER CLIMATE RECORD PATHFINDER (SCP). THIS TERRESTRIAL AND POLAR SURFACE SCATTEROMETER CLIMATE RECORD (SCR) INCLUDES DATA FROM SEAWINDS, QUIKSCAT, NSCAT, ERS-1/2, ASCAT1, SASS, AMSR-E, AND SSM/I. THE SCP SCR HAS BEEN WIDELY ADOPTED WITHIN THE CLIMATE COMMUNITY AND OUR PROCESSING ALGORITHMS ARE BEING OPERATIONALLY USED FOR SEA ICE MONITORING AND ICEBERG TRACKING. THIS INVESTIGATION WILL (1) REFINE, APPLY, AND VALIDATE UHR WIND AND SWR RETRIEVAL TECHNIQUES FOR OCEAN DATA, INCLUDING RESEARCHING IMPROVED AMBIGUITY SELECTION AND RAIN FLAGGING WITH EMPHASIS ON IMPROVING THE CONSISTENCY OF THE SCATTEROMETER WIND/RAIN CLIMATE RECORD, AND (2) CONTINUE AND EXTEND THE LAND/ICE SCP SCR FOR EXISTING SENSORS (ASCAT-1/2 AND THE OCEANSAT-2 SCATTEROMETER) AND ADD NEW SENSOR DATA (RAPIDSCAT) AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE. THE LATTER APPLICATION WILL BE FUNDAMENTAL IN SUPPORTING THE CROSS-CALIBRATION OF THE SENSORS OF THE SCR. CONTINUING THE SCP SCR WILL ENSURE A CONTINUOUS, COMPREHENSIVE, AND CONSISTENTLY PROCESSED KU- AND CBAND SCATTEROMETER BACKSCATTER LAND/ICE CLIMATE RECORD.

THE TRANSIT OF MICROBES FROM MARS TO PHOBOS WOULD NECESSARILY INVOLVE A HIGH-VELOCITY IMPACT ON THE  PHOBOS SURFACE. NUMEROUS  STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT MICROORGANISMS, PARTICULARLY BACTERIAL  SPORES, SURVIVE UNUSUALLY HIGH SHOCK PRESSURES AND OTHER HARSH CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, THESE  EXPERIMENTS DO NOT CONSTRAIN THE SURVIVABILITY OF INDIVIDUAL MICROBES AS THEY IMPACT A SOLID  SURFACE AT THESE SPEEDS.

ADDITIONAL  EXPERIMENTS WILL CHARACTERIZE THE ELASTICITY OF MICROBES DURING IMPACTS AND THE RESULTING  IMPLICATIONS FOR DISPERSAL.  IN THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENTS, MICROBES ARE CHARGED USING ELECTROSPRAY, INTRODUCED INTO VACUUM, AND  AERODYNAMICALLY ACCELERATED TO THE DESIRED VELOCITY. IMAGE CHARGE DETECTION IS USED TO MEASURE THE  VELOCITY OF EACH IMPACTING MICROBE. AFTER A SUITABLE NUMBER OF MICROBES HAVE IMPACTED UNDER ONE SET OF CONDITIONS, THE CANISTER CONTAINING THE IMPACT TARGET IS  REMOVED FOR ANALYSIS. THIS ACCELERATOR CAN EXPLORE A WIDE RANGE OF ORGANISMS AND IMPACT CONDITIONS.  NOT ONLY DOES THIS APPROACH OVERCOME THE TIME AND COST LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING METHODS FOR SHOCK SURVIVABILITY EXPERIMENTS, BUT DIRECT IMPACT OF A SPORE ON A SURFACE  IS PHYSICALLY A VERY DIFFERENT PHENOMENON THAN SHOCK TRANSMITTED TO A MICROBE THROUGH A SOLID OR  LIQUID MATRIX.

NECESSARY SYSTEM ELECTRONICS, SENSITIVE SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS AND ESPECIALLY ASTRONAUTS ONBOARD THE SPACECRAFT MUST OPERATE WITHIN A SPECIFIC TEMPERATURE WINDOW OR THE MISSION WILL FAIL. HOWEVER, THE TENDENCY OF A SPACECRAFT''S TEMPERATURE IS TO INCREASE. THE SUN AND THE EARTH RADIATE HEAT THAT IS ABSORBED INTO THE SPACECRAFT WHILE ON BOARD ELECTRONICS AND PERSONNEL GENERATE HEAT INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT. ON EARTH, THIS EXCESS HEAT WOULD NORMALLY BE REMOVED BY AIR AROUND THE SPACECRAFT. HOWEVER, THE SPACECRAFT IS IN THE VACUUM OF SPACE. AS SUCH, THE HEAT MUST ULTIMATELY BE EMITTED AWAY FROM THE SPACECRAFT AS RADIATION. COMPONENTS DESIGNED TO EMIT THIS EXCESS HEAT ARE CALLED RADIATORS AND ARE A VITAL PART OF THE THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OF ANY SPACECRAFT. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE HEAT LOAD ON A SYSTEM VARIES WITH ORBIT, RADIATORS ARE DESIGNED FOR A WORST CASE HEATING SCENARIO. AS SUCH, ANY HEATING CONFIGURATION OUTSIDE OF THE DESIGNED HEATING SCENARIO CAUSES THE RADIATOR TO BEHAVE IN AN UNDESIRABLE WAY, EMITTING MORE HEAT THAN DESIRED OR ABSORBING TOO MUCH HEAT FROM THE SURROUNDINGS. LIKEWISE, THESE RADIATORS ARE HEAVY, OFTEN COMPRISING 30 - 40 PERCENT OF TOTAL SPACECRAFT WEIGHT. A SIMPLE YET EFFECTIVE SOLUTION, AS DISCUSSED IN THE THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ROADMAP, IS TO DEVELOP A LIGHTWEIGHT RADIATOR WHICH IS ABLE TO MANIPULATE ITS HEAT REJECTION RATE IN REAL TIME.  THIS PROPOSAL DISCUSSES A LIGHT WEIGHT, VARIABLE HEAT REJECTION TECHNOLOGY THAT MAY BE UTILIZED IN MANY APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING THAT OF A DEEP SPACE RADIATOR. A THIN, MIRROR FINISH ALUMINUM FOIL IS FOLDED INTO A SIMPLE, ORIGAMI INSPIRED V GROOVE PATTERN. THIS PATTERN ALLOWS FOR THE FOIL TO BE COMPRESSED, SUCH THAT THE V GROOVES ARE VERY STEEP AND TIGHTLY COMPACTED, OR STRETCHED UNTIL IT RESEMBLES A FLAT SHEET.  AS THE FOIL IS COMPRESSED, THE AMOUNT OF HEAT RADIATED INTO SPACE OR THE AMOUNT OF HEAT ABSORBED IS GREATLY INCREASED. WHEN PULLED FLAT, THE FOIL WILL EMIT AND ABSORB VERY LITTLE RADIATION. THIS VARIABLE HEAT REJECTION CAPABILITY IS USEFUL FOR BOTH RADIATOR AND HEAT SHIELD APPLICATIONS. AS A RADIATOR, THE FOIL WILL GIVE THE USER CONTROL OF HOW MUCH HEAT IS ENTERING OR LEAVING THE SYSTEM. THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY RADIATOR WEIGHT WHILE DELIVERING OPTIMUM HEAT REJECTION PERFORMANCE FOR THE ENTIRE MISSION DURATION. LIKEWISE, THESE FOILS MAY BE USED AS HEAT SHIELDS, PLACED OVER COMPONENTS SENSITIVE TO TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS, SUCH AS CRYOGENIC FLUID TANKS.  WHEN ILLUMINATED BY THE SUN, THE SHIELD CAN ASSUME A FLAT STATE, REFLECTING 98 PERCENT OF THE SUN''S ENERGY AWAY FROM THE SENSITIVE COMPONENT.  UPON ENTERING THE EARTH''S SHADOW, THE SHIELD WILL ASSUME A COMPRESSED STATE, EMITTING EXCESS HEAT ORIGINATING FROM THE SPACECRAFT INTO DEEP SPACE INSTEAD OF REFLECTING THIS HEAT ONTO THE CRYOGENIC FLUID TANK. PRELIMINARY WORK CHARACTERIZING THE BEHAVIOR OF V GROOVES WHEN EXPOSED TO RADIATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED. HOWEVER, THE BULK OF THE WORK REMAINS. THE TOTAL HEAT REJECTED FROM A FOIL SAMPLE, ACCOUNTING FOR EMITTING SURFACE AREA, MUST BE CHARACTERIZED. LIKEWISE, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FOIL AND THE SURFACE IT IS PROTECTING MUST BE DETERMINED. NEXT, AN ACTUATION SYSTEM AND FIXATION COMPONENTS MUST BE DEVELOPED. FINALLY, THE COMPLETE THERMAL SYSTEM MUST BE MODELED AND EXPERIMENTALLY PROVEN CAPABLE OF MAINTAINING THE TEMPERATURE OF A PROTECTED SURFACE UNDER VARYING HEAT LOADS. ULTIMATELY, THE PURPOSE OF THIS WORK IS TO MODEL A COMPLETE THERMAL SYSTEM INVOLVING THE USE OF A VARIABLE HEAT REJECTION SHIELD, DEVELOP THIS TECHNOLOGY TO A SPACE READY STATE AND EXPERIMENTALLY VALIDATE ITS ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE TEMPERATURE OF A PROTECTED SURFACE WHEN EXPOSED TO VARYING HEAT LOADS."

RNA, A UNIQUELY INFORMATION-DENSE AND CATALYTIC BIOMOLECULE, SITS AT THE CENTER OF THIS REQUIREMENT FOR LIFE IN ALL KNOWN BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRANSITION FROM SIMPLE CHEMICAL TO COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. AMONG RNA COMPONENTS DEFINING THE CENTRAL DOGMA, THERE IS PERHAPS NONE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE RIBOSOME, WHICH SERVES AS A CELLULAR NEXUS OF INFORMATION TRANSFER, RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND GROWTH MODULATION. CONSERVATION OF THE RIBOSOME IS USED TO TRACE EVOLUTIONARY TRAJECTORIES ACROSS THE TREE OF LIFE FROM LUCA, YET THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT RRNA-BASED PHYLOGENETIC RECONSTRUCTIONS OF INTERMEDIATE VERSIONS OF THE TRANSLATIONAL APPARATUS. METHODOLOGIES THAT ENABLE THE RECONSTRUCTION AND EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION OF ANCESTRAL RIBOSOME INTERMEDIATES ALONG PLAUSIBLE EVOLUTIONARY TRAJECTORIES TO ITS CURRENT FORM WOULD TRANSFORM OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ORIGIN OF LIFE ON EARTH, ELUCIDATE THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN RIBOSOMES, AND POTENTIALLY INFORM ROUTES FOR TRANSLATION ELSEWHERE IN THE COSMOS. MAJOR GOALS: HISTORICALLY, ORIGINS-OF-LIFE RESEARCHERS HAVE FOCUSED ON A􀁅BOTTOM-UP􀁅 APPROACH TO THE PREDICTION OF INTERMEDIATE PRE-BIOTIC BIOMOLECULES, IN WHICH ARTIFICIAL CHEMICAL SYSTEMS ARE CONSTRUCTED IN ATTEMPTS TO RECREATE CONDITIONS ON THE EARLY EARTH. CONVERSELY, A􀁅TOP-DOWN􀁅 APPROACH, IN WHICH EXISTING BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS ARE REDUCED TO THEIR UNDERLYING COMPONENTS, WOULD INFORM THE FUNCTIONAL AND MINIMAL COMPONENTS THAT MAY HAVE EXISTED IN A PREBIOTIC ERA. WE PROPOSE TO TAKE A TOP-DOWN APPROACH TO THE MINIMIZATION OF THE RIBOSOME WITHIN THE FUNCTIONALITY-RELEVANT ENVIRONMENT OF THE CELL. SUCH A COMBINATION OF THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS WOULD INFORM THE CHEMICAL FUNCTIONALITY DEFINING TRANSLATION. HOWEVER, STUDIES AIMED AT PROBING CELLULAR TRANSLATION HAVE RARELY ACCESSED SUCH A DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF THE MINIMAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSLATION. THIS IS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH RIBOSOME MANIPULATION IN VIVO, AS TRANSLATION CANNOT BE EASILY UNCOUPLED FROM CELLULAR VIABILITY OR OVERALL FITNESS. THUS, OUR PROPOSED WORK REQUIRES THE REMOVAL OF CONFOUNDING ATTRIBUTES REGULATING CELLULAR VIABILITY THAT MAY BE INCORRECTLY ASSUMED TO INFLUENCE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS BIOMOLECULAR ACTIVITY. SPECIFIC AIMS: TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, WE PROPOSE TO INTEGRATE SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY, COMPUTATIONAL AND PHYLOGENETIC RRNA ANALYSIS, AND EVOLUTIONARY PRINCIPLES TO INFORM PLAUSIBLE AND TESTABLE MINIMAL RIBOSOME INTERMEDIATES EN ROUTE TO THE EXTANT TRANSLATION MACHINERY OF THE CELL: 1. AIM I: CONSTRUCTION OF A DEFINED SENSOR THAT RECAPITULATES RIBOSOMAL ACTIVITY IN E. COLI AS A MODULAR AND ORTHOGONAL PLATFORM BY UNCOUPLING TRANSLATION FROM HOST VIABILITY. 2. AIM II: APPLICATION OF THIS SENSOR PLATFORM TOWARDS THE IN VIVO ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF RRNA TRUNCATIONS AND/OR MUTATIONS ON TRANSLATION OF A SINGULAR SYNTHETIC MRNA TRANSCRIPT. 3. AIM III: OPTIMIZATION OF MINIMIZED RRNA VARIANTS USING PHAGE-ASSISTED CONTINUOUS EVOLUTION (PACE) TO REVEAL COMPENSATORY MUTATIONS THAT ENHANCE ACTIVITY. CONCLUSION: OUR PROPOSED WORK AIMS TO OVERCOME CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH RIBOSOMAL MANIPULATION IN VIVO AND PROVIDES AN INNOVATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR THE DERIVATION OF MINIMIZED RIBOSOMES. WHILE THIS IS AN AMBITIOUS INTEGRATION OF EVOLUTIONARY PRINCIPLES AND SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY TO ILLUMINATE THE ORIGINS OF TRANSLATION, WE HOPE THAT IT WILL SUPPLEMENT THE EXISTING (BUT INCOMPLETE) MOLECULAR RECORD OF RIBOSOMAL EVOLUTION AND PROVIDE NOVEL INSIGHT INTO POTENTIAL PROTO-RIBOSOMAL GENOTYPES AND PHENOTYPES. OUR PROPOSED WORK WOULD MARK THE FIRST MAJOR EFFORT TO MINIMIZE THIS COMPLEX MACROMOLECULAR MACHINE, PROVIDING EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE FOR A POTENTIAL ROUTE TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIFE OF EARTH."

MINERALOGIC DATA SUGGEST A TRANSITION FROM PHYLLOSILICATE FORMATION AND CIRCUM-NEUTRAL PH AQUEOUS PROCESSES TO A MORE ACIDIC, WATER-LIMITED SULFATEFORMING ERA KEY TO DISCERNING THE NATURE AND CAUSES OF OBSERVED ENVIRONMENTAL TRANSITIONS ON EARLY MARS IS THE CHARACTERIZATION OF CONTINUOUS STRATIGRAPHIC SECTIONS WITH ROCK UNITS THAT SPAN THIS CRITICAL TIME INTERVAL. IT HAS BEEN HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE REGION WEST OF THE ISIDIS BASIN AT THE INTERSECTION OF SOUTHERN NILI FOSSAE AND NORTHEASTERN SYRTIS MAJOR (ALSO REFERRED TO AS NE SYRTIS) CONTAINS ROCK UNITS OF DIVERSE AQUEOUS MINERALOGY THAT TRAVERSE THE NOACHIAN-HESPERIAN AND THE ROCK UNITS ARE IN THEIR ORIGINAL STRATIGRAPHIC CONTEXT. THE STRATIGRAPHY AT NE SYRTIS SPANS THE EARLY NOACHIAN TO EARLY HESPERIAN, PRESERVING A TIME-ORDERED RECORD OF BASIN-FORMING IMPACT, EMPLACEMENT OF OLIVINE-RICH ROCK, FLUVIAL ACTIVITY, AQUEOUS ALTERATION, PLAINS VOLCANISM, AND OUTFLOW CHANNELS. THE MINERALOGY OF ALTERATION MINERALS RECORDS A CHANGE IN WATER CHEMISTRY FROM NEUTRAL TO ALKALINE PH CONDITIONS PROMOTING CLAY AND CARBONATE FORMATION TO HIGHLY ACIDIC CONDITIONS PROMOTING FORMATION OF THE MINERAL JAROSITE IN FLUIDIZED FRACTURES WITHIN LAYERED SULFATEBEARING DEPOSITS. THESE WELL-PRESERVED STRATA PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TESTING KEY HYPOTHESES REGARDING GEOLOGIC PROCESSES AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE ON EARLY MARS. DESPITE THE BROAD INTEREST IN THE NE SYRTIS AND NILI FOSSAE REGION THERE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS LEFT UNRESOLVED. WHAT IS THE NATURE OF PHYLLOSILICATE DIVERSITY ACROSS THE REGION FROM THE NORTHERN HIGHLANDS TO THE PLANS NEAR JEZERO CRATER? HOW DOES PHYLLOSILCIATE DIVERSITY VARY WITH CONTEXT (BASEMENT UNITS VS HIGHER STRATIGRAPHIC LEVELS)? WHAT IS THE DIVERSITY OF CARBONATE MINERALOGY ACROSS THE REGION AND WHAT OTHER MINERALS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DEPOSITS? DOES CARBONATE SPECTRAL PROPERTIES VARY WITH GEOLOGIC SETTING (E.G. HIGHLAND REGIONS VS LOWER ELEVATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OUTFLOW SYSTEMS)? WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE SULFATEBEARING DEPOSITS (EHLMANN AND MUSTARD, 2012) AND HOW EXTENSIVE ARE THEY? DO THEY REPRESENT FUNDAMENTAL ALTERATION OF VOLCANIC ROCKS, UPWELLING OF SUBSURFACE BRINES (E.G. ANDREWS-HANNA ET AL) OR ANOTHER PROCESS? AMONG THIS RANGE OF COMPELLING QUESTIONS WE PROPOSE TO FOCUS ON THREE KEY THRUSTS. WHAT IS THE DETAILED NATURE OF PHYLLOSILICATE DIVERSITY WITHIN THE FUNDAMENTAL UNITS IN NE SYRTIS? HOW DOES THE CHARACTER OF CARBONATE MINERALOGY VARY ACROSS THE REGION? AND WHAT IS THE MINERALOGY AND GEOLOGIC SETTING OF SULFATEBEARING DEPOSITS? THESE THREE THRUSTS STRADDLE THE PROPOSED NOACHIAN-HESPERIAN TRANSITION IN MINERALOGY AND GEOLOGY AND PREVIOUS WORK HAS SHOWN THAT THESE QUESTIONS CAN BE ADDRESSED BY MAPPING THE STRATIGRAPHY AND MINERALOGY."""

THE SILICATE ''MAGMA OCEANS'' SOLIDIFY AS THE PLANETS COOL, LEAVING CHEMICALLY DIFFERENTIATED, HETEROGENEOUS INTERIORS. SUBSEQUENT TO MAGMA OCEAN SOLIDIFICATION, THE INTERIORS OF SMALL ROCKY BODIES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM, LIKE THE MOON, APPEAR NOT TO HAVE UNDERGONE EXTENSIVE CONVECTIVE MIXING. BECAUSE OF THIS, THEIR INITIAL CHEMICAL STRATIFICATION STRONGLY GOVERNS THEIR SUBSEQUENT EVOLUTION.

THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO CONSTRAIN HOW THIS SOLIDIFICATION TOOK PLACE, AND TO COMPARE IT TO MODELS FOR ITS CURRENT COMPOSITIONAL HETEROGENEITY. THE FIRST PHASE OF THE STUDY WILL USE HIGH PRESSURE EXPERIMENTS TO DETERMINE THE CRYSTALLIZATION SEQUENCE OF A MODEL MMO COMPOSITION UNDER THE HIGHLY REDUCING CONDITIONS AND HIGH S CONTENTS, THOUGHT TO BE RELEVANT TO MERCURY. THIS PART OF THE STUDY WILL DETERMINE WHAT PHASES WILL CRYSTALLIZE FROM THE MAGMA OCEAN AND WHAT THEIR COMPOSITIONS ARE. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE THE FINAL COMPOSITIONAL LAYERING WITHIN THE SOLIDIFIED MMO BECAUSE 1) THE CRYSTALS WILL, IN GENERAL, NOT BE THE SAME DENSITY AS THE MAGMA AND WILL SINK OR FLOAT, AND 2) THE MMO WILL BE CONVECTING, WHICH WILL TEND TO RESIST CRYSTAL SEGREGATION. THUS, THE SECOND PHASE OF THE STUDY WILL USE THE PHASE EQUILIBRIA DATA TO CONSTRUCT A NUMERICAL MODEL OF CRYSTAL SEGREGATION IN A CONVECTING MAGMA OCEAN. THE RESULT WILL BE A CHEMICALLY AND PHYSICALLY CONSISTENT ESTIMATE OF THE CHEMICAL STRATIFICATION OF MERCURY''S MANTLE JUST AFTER MMO SOLIDIFICATION. THIS STRATIFICATION IS A FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTY OF THE PLANET AND GOVERNED ITS SUBSEQUENT CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL EVOLUTION.

THE NUMERICAL MODELS WILL BE BASED ON PREVIOUS MODELS DEVELOPED AT BROWN UNIVERSITY FOR LUNAR MAGMA OCEAN CRYSTALLIZATION, BUT WILL INCLUDE NEW THEORETICAL WORK ON THE PHYSICS OF CRYSTAL SEGREGATION. IN EACH TIME STEP OF THE MODEL, THE PHASE EQUILIBRIA WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE WHAT PHASES CRYSTALLIZE AND THEIR COMPOSITIONS.

THE PROPOSED WORK THEREFORE SEEKS TO ENHANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THESE AQUEOUS DRIVEN SEDIMENTARY PROCESSES IN VALLES MARINERIS THROUGH THE SYSTEMATIC SPECTRAL ANALYSIS OF PHS AND MHS. THE OVERARCHING GOALS OF THIS WORK ARE TO: 1) DETERMINE THE SPECTRAL HETEROGENEITY OF THE PHS SPECTRAL CLASS THROUGHOUT VALLES MARINERIS AND ESTABLISH SUB-CLASSES 2) CORRELATE THE MINERALOGY TO THE SUBCLASSES THROUGH QUANTITATIVE MODELLING 3) SYNTHESIZE THE MAPPED RESULTS WITH THE GEOLOGIC CONTEXT FOR THE DIFFERENT HYDROLOGIC SETTINGS IN VALLES MARINERIS TO ESTABLISH REGIONAL HYDROLOGICAL MODELS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT CHASMA.

HOWEVER, THE NEEDS OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TO EASILY SEARCH AND ACCESS THIS LARGE DATABASE HAVE GROWN TREMENDOUSLY DURING THE DIGITAL AGE AND IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE DATABASE TO EVOLVE IN ORDER TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. HERE WE PROPOSE SEVERAL IMPORTANT STEPS TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE AND IMPROVE THE USABILITY AND SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF THE VAST RELAB SPECTRAL LIBRARY. THE WORK PLAN CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THREE MAJOR TASKS: TASK 1: RESTRUCTURE EXISTING SPECTRAL DATABASE/CATALOG, CORRECT INCONSISTENCIES, AND INCORPORATE INTO A RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO PREPARE FOR INTEGRATION WITH AN ONLINE SEARCH TOOL. WHEN POSSIBLE, MISSING SAMPLE INFORMATION WILL BE ADDED TO THE DATABASE AS WELL AS AUXILIARY SAMPLE INFORMATION (CHEMISTRY, MINERALOGY, PHOTOS, ETC.). TASK 2: FORMAT ALL EXISTING SPECTRAL FILES TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH PDS4 STANDARDS AND, AFTER PEER REVIEW, DELIVER ALL EXISTING SPECTRAL DATA TO THE PDS GEOSCIENCES NODE (AT WASHINGTON UNIV. IN ST. LOUIS) FOR FORMAL ARCHIVING THROUGH NASA. OUR GOAL IS TO ESTABLISH A SYSTEM IN WHICH ALL FUTURE SPECTRAL DATA ARE MADE PDS-COMPLIANT AS THEY ARE COLLECTED, ENSURING SIMPLE AND STREAMLINED DELIVERY TO THE PDS IN FUTURE YEARS AS THE DATABASE GROWS. TASK 3: CREATE A USER-FRIENDLY ONLINE TOOL FOR SEARCHING THE RELAB DATABASE, EXAMINING SPECTRAL PLOTS, AND DOWNLOADING DATA AS DESIRED.

INITIAL STUDIES OF DAWN VISIBLE INFRARED SPECTROMETER (VIR) DATA HAVE FOCUSED ON QUALITATIVE COMPARISONS OF SPECTRAL FEATURES TO THOSE OBSERVED IN LAB DATA OF HOWARDITE, EUCRITE, AND DIOGENITE (HED) METEORITES, RESULTING IN ESTIMATES OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE METEORITE COMPONENTS ON VESTA S SURFACE. HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANTLY MORE INFORMATION CAN BE GAINED IF QUANTITATIVE MINERAL ABUNDANCES CAN BE DERIVED FROM SUCH DATA, ESPECIALLY AT A GLOBAL SCALE. MODAL MINERALOGY AND KNOWLEDGE OF VARIATIONS IN PYROXENE CHEMISTRY, FOR INSTANCE, CAN BE USEFUL FOR ASSESSING VARIATIONS IN EUCRITE AND DIOGENITE COMPONENT ABUNDANCES WITHIN REGIONS WHOSE SPECTRA ARE  HOWARDITE-LIKE . IN ADDITION, DETAILED MIXING MODELS THAT YIELD ACCURATE MODAL MINERALOGY CAN HELP TO IDENTIFY AREAS THAT MAY INDICATE LOWER CRUSTAL OR MANTLE COMPOSITIONS, REVEALING NEW INFORMATION ABOUT LITHOLOGIC VARIATIONS WITH DEPTH. THE MAJOR GOAL OF THIS WORK WILL BE TO PRODUCE GLOBAL MAPS OF MINERAL ABUNDANCES DERIVED FROM HAPKE AND SHKURATOV MODELS AS APPLIED TO VIR DATA AND TO DISCUSS THE IMPLICATIONS OF OBSERVED VARIATIONS IN MINERALOGY IN THE CONTEXT OF HED COMPOSITIONS AND PETROLOGIC EVOLUTION MODELS FOR VESTA. METHODS: THESE GOALS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY APPLYING RADIATIVE TRANSFER MODELS (RTMS) TO DAWN VIR DATA. A PILOT STUDY HAS BEEN CONDUCTED TO VALIDATE OUR METHODS AND DEMONSTRATE OUR ABILITY TO WORK WITH VIR DATA. TO FURTHER TEST THE VALIDITY OF HAPKE AND SHKURATOV RTMS FOR HED AND DAWN SPECTRA, WE WILL FIRST CARRY OUT ADDITIONAL LAB MEASUREMENTS OF HOWARDITE SAMPLES TO EXPAND UPON OUR EXISTING TEST DATASET THAT RELIED UPON DIOGENITE AND EUCRITE SAMPLES.

MATLAB SCRIPTS WILL BE USED TO APPLY OUR RTM CODES TO THE VIR DATA, RESULTING IN MODAL MINERALOGY MAPS (E.G., MAPS OF OLIVINE, PYROXENE, PLAGIOCLASE ABUNDANCE, ETC.). THE RESULTING MAPS AND SPECTRA WILL THEN BE COMPARED TO HED SPECTRA AND COMPOSITIONS TO ASSESS DIFFERENT PETROLOGIC MODELS. DAWN FRAMING CAMERA DATA WILL BE EXAMINED FOR AREAS OF SPECIAL INTEREST (E.G., HIGH OLIVINE AND/OR HIGH PYROXENE CONCENTRATIONS) TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE LOCAL GEOLOGIC CONTEXT OF THESE REGIONS. RELEVANCE: THIS WORK IS RELEVANT TO THE DDAP CALL IN THAT IT WILL ENHANCE THE SCIENTIFIC RETURN OF THE DAWN AT VESTA MISSION THROUGH THE PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS OF EXISTING DAWN VIR DATA TO PRODUCE QUANTITATIVE MINERAL MAPS OF VESTA S SURFACE. THESE MINERAL MAPS WILL BE COMPARED AGAINST SPECTRAL AND MINERALOGICAL COMPOSITIONS OF HED METEORITES TO TEST VARIOUS MODELS ABOUT THE PETROLOGIC EVOLUTION OF VESTA, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE ABUNDANCE OF EUCRITE AND DIOGENITE COMPONENTS IN REGIONS THAT ARE SPECTRALLY AKIN TO HOWARDITES.

MODELS OF THE CRUSTAL STRUCTURE OF THE BASINS WILL BE USED TO QUANTIFY THE DIP AND DISPLACEMENT ACROSS INDIVIDUAL FAULTS. COMPARISONS BETWEEN BASINS AND ASYMMETRIES WITHIN INDIVIDUAL BASINS WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE SENSITIVITY OF THE RING FAULT CHARACTERISTICS TO TARGET PROPERTIES SUCH AS CRUSTAL THICKNESS AND HEAT FLOW.

ADDITIONAL ANALYSES WILL FOCUS ON THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT TARGET PROPERTIES BY COMPARING BASINS THAT DIFFER PRIMARILY IN A SINGLE KEY PARAMETER. THE EFFECT OF HEAT FLOW WILL BE INVESTIGATED LOOKING AT TWO SIMILARLY SIZED BASINS WITHIN AND OUTSIDE OF THE PKT (E.G., IMBRIUM AND ORIENTALE), OR TWO SIMILARLY SIZED BASINS FORMED IN THE PRE-NECTARIAN AND NECTARIAN/IMBRIAN (E.G., SMITHII AND ORIENTALE). THE EFFECT OF CRUSTAL THICKNESS WILL BE INVESTIGATED BY COMPARING TWO SIMILARLY SIZED BASINS IN THE THICK CRUST OF THE FARSIDE HIGHLAND AND THE THIN CRUST OF THE SOUTH POLE-AITKEN BASIN (E.G., HERTZSPRUNG AND APOLLO).

EXPERIMENTS WILL BE RUN FROM 0.1 GPA IN AN INTERNALLY-HEATED PRESSURE VESSEL TO 1 AND 2 GPA IN THE PISTON CYLINDER FOR A RANGE OF FO2 (IW-3 TO IW-7). THE ELECTRON MICROPROBE (EPMA) WILL BE USED TO ANALYZE MAJOR AND MINOR ELEMENTS INCLUDING S, NA, AND K, AND THE SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETER (SIMS) WILL BE USED TO ANALYZE TRACE VOLATILES (H, C, S, CL, F). APPLICATIONS INCLUDE 1) ESTIMATING THE FO2 OF SAMPLES FROM VOLATILE CONTENT OF NVM AND 2) ESTIMATING VOLATILE CONTENT OF REDUCED PLANETARY INTERIORS. PLACING THERMODYNAMIC CONSTRAINTS ON VOLATILES IN NVM IN THESE REDUCED SYSTEMS IS CRUCIAL BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN OUTSIZED EFFECT ON MINERAL PROPERTIES SUCH AS STIFFNESS, VISCOSITY, ONSET OF MELTING, AS WELL AS EXPLOSIVE VOLCANISM ON MERCURY"

THE ALTERATION PATHWAY OF OLIVINE TO MAGNESITE CAN TAKE SEVERAL FORMS WITH DIFFERENT INTERMEDIATE AND FINAL PRODUCT ASSEMBLAGES DEPENDING ON THE DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OF FORMATION.

THE PROPOSED EFFORT HERE WILL RIGOROUSLY EXAMINE HYPOTHESES FOR MINERAL ASSEMBLAGES AND GEOLOGIC EVOLUTION WITH ADVANCED DATA ANALYSIS. WE WILL COMPARE AND CONTRAST 4 ADVANCED MINERAL CHARACTERIZATION ALGORITHMS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SCIENCE OF THE 3 REMAINING MARS 2020 LANDING SITES. THE ALGORITHMS THAT WILL BE COMPARED ARE (1) RADIATIVE TRANSFER UNMIXING FROM OPTICAL CONSTANTS, (2) SPARSE UNMIXING WITH LARGE LIBRARIES OF ENDMEMBERS, (3) TARGET TRANSFORMATION FOR MINERAL PRESENCE/ABSENCE DETERMINATIONS IN CLUTTERED SCENES AND FOR MINERALS WITH SUBTLE FEATURES AND (4) MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES. THE PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON THE BEST MINERAL EXPOSURES IN THESE FIVE SITES. THE SITES THAT HAVE ROVER COVERAGE (OPPORTUNITY, COLUMBIA HILLS AND CURIOSITY) HAVE A MEASURE OF GROUND TRUTH TO COMPARE WITH. THE MULTIPLE WORKING HYPOTHESES FOR THE GEOLOGIC EVOLUTION WILL BE EVALUATED AGAINST THESE MORE ROBUST ANALYSES OF THE MINERAL. THE PROPOSED WORK IS BROKEN INTO FOUR TASKS. (1) EVALUATION AND COMPARISON OF THE FOUR TECHNIQUES USING TWO SOURCES OF LABORATORY MIXTURE DATA: 1) 8 SUITES OF MIXTURES THAT HAVE EXISTING LABORATORY REFLECTANCE SPECTRA AND 2) LABORATORY HYPERSPECTRAL DATA OF AQUEOUS MINERALS MIXED WITH A NEW MARS SOIL SIMULANT. THE EVALUATION WILL INCLUDE THE ACCURACY OF THE APPROACHES IN DETERMINING THE CORRECT MINERAL ASSEMBLAGES AND WHERE APPROPRIATE ABUNDANCES. (2) ANALYSIS OF HIGH QUALITY CRISM OBSERVATIONS OF THE 4 MARS 2020 LANDING SITES WITH THE FOUR TECHNIQUES. THIS WILL REQUIRE CAREFUL TAILORING OF THE TECHNIQUES TO THE UNIQUE QUALITIES OF CRISM DATA COMPARED TO LABORATORY DATA. (3) CRITICAL EVALUATION OF THE QUALITY OF THE APPROACHES INDEPENDENTLY USING STATISTICAL MEASURES OF GOODNESS OF FIT AND INTER COMPARISON OF THE RESULTS.

BESIDES USING LIDARS FOR ALTIMETRY, THESE DEVICES HAVE BEEN USED TO STUDY ATMOSPHERES AND ICE. THE LIDAR IN-SPACE TECHNOLOGY EXPERIMENT (LITE) IN THE 1990 S DEMONSTRATED A NUMBER OF CAPABILITIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS ON BOARD THE SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY. ONE NEW POTENTIAL APPLICATION IS THE USE OF LIDARS FOR PLANETARY SEISMOLOGY. TYPICALLY, SEISMOLOGISTS EXPLOIT MEASUREMENTS OF PRIMARY (P), SECONDARY (S), AND RAYLEIGH WAVES TO INFER STRUCTURE OF THE UNDERLYING PLANETARY BODY. THE P-WAVES ARE LONGITUDINAL WAVES WHICH TRAVEL AT THE COMPRESSIONAL WAVE SPEED IN THE BODY. THE S-WAVES OR SHEAR WAVES ARE TRANSVERSE WAVES WHICH TRAVEL AT THE SHEAR WAVE SPEED. RAYLEIGH WAVES ARE VERTICALLY- POLARIZED PROPAGATING WAVES THAT ARE TRAPPED AT THE INTERFACE BETWEEN AN ELASTIC MEDIUM AND A VACUUM (OR LOW DENSITY ATMOSPHERE SUCH AS EARTH). THESE WAVES CAN PROPAGATE LARGE DISTANCE BECAUSE THEIR AMPLITUDES DECAY PRIMARILY AS ONE OVER SQUARE ROOT OF RANGE, AS OPPOSED TO COMPRESSIONAL (P) AND SHEAR (S) WAVES, WHICH DECAY AS ONE OF RANGE. RAYLEIGH WAVES ARE THE CAUSE OF MUCH DAMAGE DUE SEISMIC ACTIVITY ON EARTH BUT ALSO CAN BE EXCITED BY IMPACTORS ON THE MOONS AND ROCKY PLANETS. SUCH WAVES CAN PROPAGATE IN ICE SHEETS ON EUROPA. INTERFACE WAVES AT THE SEABED ARE CALLED SCHOLTE WAVES AND THOSE WAVES AT THE INTERFACE OF TWO ELASTIC MEDIA ARE CALLED STONELY WAVES. THE DISPERSION OF THE SPEED OF RAYLEIGH WAVES (OFTEN REFERRED TO AS P-SV WAVES) AS A FUNCTION OF FREQUENCY IS DEPENDENT ON THE UNDERLYING VERTICAL PROFILE OF ELASTIC MEDIUM PROPERTIES SUCH AS THE SHEAR MODULUS/SPEED. A NUMBER OF TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE ESTIMATION OF THE VERTICAL SHEAR SPEED GIVEN MEASUREMENTS OF RAYLEIGH WAVE DISPERSION FROM EXPLOSIONS, IMPACTS AND OTHER ENERGETIC SOURCES. MEASUREMENTS OF RAYLEIGH WAVES HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN TAKEN USING GEOPHONES AT LOW FREQUENCIES AND ACCELEROMETERS AT MID- TO HIGH FREQUENCIES. RECENTLY, WE HAVE DEVELOPED CHIRP LASERS TO MEASURE BOTH RANGE AND SURFACE MOTION THROUGH A NASA-EPSCOR RESEARCH SEED GRANT. HERE, WE PROPOSE TO BUILD A LOW SWAP-C (SIZE, WEIGHT, POWER AND COST) WITH TWO OPERATIONAL MODES (RANGING MODE AND DOPPLER MODE) FOR REMOTE SURFACE MEASUREMENT. UNDER RANGING MODE, THE LIDAR SENDS OFF CHIRPED LASER PULSE FOR FREQUENCY MODULATED CONTINUOUS WAVE (FMCW) BASED RANGING OPERATION. UNDER DOPPLER MODE, THE LASER OUTPUTS A HIGH-QUALITY NARROW-LINEWIDTH SINGLE WAVELENGTH LASER, AND RECEIVES THE BEAT SIGNAL BETWEEN THE INCIDENT WAVE AND REFLECTION WAVE TO MEASURE THE SURFACE VELOCITY. THE DUALMODE LIDAR WILL BE BUILT AROUND A DIGITAL CIRCUIT, THE MODE CAN BE CONTROLLED DIGITALLY AND REMOTELY, AND THE SWITCH TIME IS WELL WITHIN 1 MS. IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE STUDY, THE SCIENCE PI (T. WEI, URI) AND TEAM (G. POTTY AND J. H. MILLER, ALSO URI) PROPOSE TO (A) INVESTIGATE THE ENGINEERING AND SIGNAL PROCESSING; AND (B) DEVELOP A MODEL TO PRODUCE SYNTHETIC GROUND MOTION DATA AND RESULTING MODELED LASER PULSE RETURNS. IN THE SECOND YEAR OF THE PROJECT, WE PROPOSE TO DEMONSTRATE THE CHIRP LASER IN A LABORATORY SETTING USING TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED BY THE P.I.S DESCRIBED ABOVE. WE ALSO FORESEE THE CONTINUED MODELING EFFORTS RESULTING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALGORITHMS FOR THE ESTIMATION OF GROUND PROPERTIES. IN THE THIRD YEAR OF THE PROJECT, WE PROPOSE TO DEMONSTRATE A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM IN A FIELD EXPERIMENT. THE FIELD EXPERIMENT WOULD INVOLVE MEASURING BOTH ALTITUDE AND GROUND MOTION USING A CHIRP LASER ON BOARD A MOVING AERIAL PLATFORM SUCH AS A DRONE, HELICOPTER OR SMALL AIRCRAFT. THE REFINEMENTS NECESSARY FOR THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM TO BE LAUNCHED INTO SPACE WILL BE INVESTIGATED THROUGH COLLABORATION WITH RESEARCHERS AT NASA GODDARD."

THE STUDY PROPOSED HERE, HOWEVER, WILL USE THESE NEW ENVIRONMENTAL PROXIES TO TEST THEIR USE TO CHARACTERIZE THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER ONE SPECIFIC IMPACT DURING THE MID-PLIOCENE IN ARGENTINA (3.3MA) NEAR MAR DEL PLATA. THIS EVENT OCCURRED NEARLY COINCIDENT WITH A MAJOR FAUNAL TURNOVER WHEN 37% OF ALL GENERA AND 53% OF ALL ENDEMIC SPECIES BECAME EXTINCT. THIS PERIOD OF TIME IS OF GREAT INTEREST BECAUSE IT WAS DURING THE MID-PLIOCENE WARM PERIOD OPTIMUM (PERIOD OF GLOBAL WARMTH #tilde#2.9-3.3 MA OFTEN USED AS AN ANALOG FOR FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE. HENCE THIS PROPOSED EFFORT WILL ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: (A) CAN THE MULTI-PROXY (ORGANIC GEOCHEMICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MAGNETIC) METHODS DEVELOPED AND USED SUCCESSFULLY IN MORE RECENT SEDIMENTS PROVIDE EQUIVALENT RESULTS FROM OLDER LOESS/LOESSOID SEDIMENTS IN ARGENTINA? (B) WHAT ARE THE PALEOENVIRONMENTAL AND BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES FOR THE MAR DEL PLATA METEORITE IMPACT RECORDED IN THE LOESS/LOESSOID SEQUENCE AT CHAPADMALAL? (C) AND WAS THE MID-PLIOCENE FAUNAL TURNOVER IMPACT-RELATED OR CLIMATE-RELATED? SPECIFICALLY, WE PROPOSE TO ACQUIRE TWO SHALLOW DRILL/CORES (40M) ACROSS THIS PERIOD IN A KNOW SECTION OF ARGENTINA NEAR MAR DEL PLATA AS WELL AS RECOVER MORE LIMITED SAMPLING ACROSS THE IMPACT HORIZON IN SELECTED OUTCROPS. THIS PERIOD OF TIME IS ALSO OF GREAT INTEREST BECAUSE IT WAS DURING THE MID-PLIOCENE WARM PERIOD OPTIMUM (PERIOD OF GLOBAL WARMTH #tilde#2.9-3.3 MA OFTEN USED AS AN ANALOG FOR FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE. OUR STUDY WILL PROVIDE A CASE STUDY OF HOW ONE IMPACT EVENT CAN AFFECT THE LOCAL AND/OR REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTS AND THE ASPECTS OF LIFE AND ECOLOGY IN THOSE ENVIRONMENTS. IF SUCCESSFUL, THEN THESE RESULTS CAN BE APPLIED TO OTHER IMPORTANT TRANSITIONS IN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. THIS EFFORT DIRECTLY ADDRESSES EPSCOR OBJECTIVES BY CONTINUING AND STRENGTHENING THE COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH BETWEEN JURISDICTION UNIVERSITIES (UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND AND BROWN UNIVERSITY), DEMONSTRATING THE USE OF A NEW TRACER OF THE BIOLOGIC RESPONSE TO AN IMPACT, PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVOLVE GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS IN AN INTERNATIONAL, MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH PROGRAM, AND CREATING AND ENHANCING OTHER FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES (E.G., NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NASA EXOBIOLOGY)."

THIS INFERENCE WILL ENABLE A PERSON TO EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE COMPLEX REQUIREMENTS AND TASKS CONSTRAINTS TO THE PERSON AT VERY ABSTRACT LEVELS (E.G., ``INSPECT THE ISS'''') AND AT VERY SPECIFIC LEVELS (E.G., ``MOVE LEFT SIX INCHES,'''') AS WELL AS ASKING TARGETED QUESTIONS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ABSTRACTION (E.G., ``DO YOU MEAN THE PHILIPS SCREWDRIVER OR THE FLAT HEAD?''''). THE END GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ACHIEVE SEAMLESS HUMAN-ROBOT COOPERATION ON COMPLEX TASKS, APPROACHING THE EASE AND ACCURACY OF HUMAN-HUMAN COLLABORATION. HUMANS COMMUNICATING WITH OTHER HUMANS USING LANGUAGE TO EXPRESS VERY ABSTRACT GOALS AS WELL AS VERY LOW-LEVEL CONCRETE COMMANDS. THIS USE OF LANGUAGE ENABLES HIGH LEVELS OF AUTONOMY BUT ALSO SUPPORTS FLEXIBLE AND FLUID CORRECTIONS AND REPLANNING. ROBOTS THAT CAN USE FLUID LANGUAGE AT MULTIPLE LEVELS OF ABSTRACTION CAN FLEXIBLY RESPOND TO A PERSON''S REQUESTS. THE ULTIMATE IMPACT IS A WORLD WHERE ROBOTS ACTIVELY INTERPRET A PERSON''S INSTRUCTIONS, ASKING QUESTIONS WHEN THEY ARE CONFUSED, AND ASKING FOR HELP WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER A PROBLEM. THIS PROPOSAL WILL ASSESS PERFORMANCE USING TWO TASKS: NATURAL LANGUAGE CONTROL OF AN AR DRONE UAV (AS A MODEL FOR ASTROBEE) AND NATURAL LANGUAGE-BASED COLLABORATIVE ASSEMBLY USING BAXTER (AS A MODEL FOR ROBONAUT). THESE TASKS WILL ASSESS THE ABILITY OF THE FRAMEWORK TO FACILITATE IMPROVED HUMAN-ROBOT COLLABORATION USING LANGUAGE-BASED INTERFACES AND DECISION-THEORETIC PLANNING."

THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THIS PROPOSED STUDY ARE TWOFOLD: (1) TO USE TEMPERATURE- AND COMPOSITION DEPENDENT MINERAL-MELT AND MINERAL-MINERAL REE PARTITION COEFFICIENTS TO INFER MAGMATIC AND SUBSOLIDUS PROCESSES EXPERIENCED BY MAFIC AND ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS FROM THE MOON (LUNAR FERROAN ANORTHOSITES AND MG-SUITE ROCKS), MARS, AND HED METEORITES, AND (2) TO EXPLORE THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR THE AGE AND THE THERMAL AND MAGMATIC EVOLUTION OF PARENT BODIES. GIVEN THE UBIQUITOUS PRESENCE OF PLAGIOCLASE AND PYROXENE IN CUMULATE ROCKS FROM THE MOON, MARS, AND HED METEORITES, WE PLAN TO DEVELOP A REE-INPLAGIOCLASECLINOPYROXENE THERMOMETER AND A REE-IN-PLAGIOCLASE-ORTHOPYROXENE THERMOMETER FOR MAFIC AND ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS IN THIS PROPOSED STUDY. A REE-IN-TWO PYROXENE THERMOMETER WAS RECENTLY DEVELOPED IN PI S LAB FOR MAFIC AND ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS. PART OF THIS PROPOSED STUDY WILL FOCUS ON ITS FURTHER CALIBRATION IN FE-RICH SYSTEMS AND ITS PLANETARY APPLICATION. DUE TO THEIR SLOW DIFFUSION RATES, TRIVALENT REE HAVE HIGHER CLOSURE TEMPERATURES THAN DIVALENT CA, MG, AND FE IN PYROXENE AND PLAGIOCLASE. THE DIFFERENCES IN TEMPERATURES BETWEEN THE REE-BASED THERMOMETERS AND THE DIVALENT CATION-BASED THERMOMETERS WILL BE USED TO INFER COOLING RATES OF THE CUMULATE ROCKS. THE LATTER CAN SHED NEW LIGHT ON THE THERMAL HISTORY OF THE PARENT BODIES. RELEVANCY: MAFIC AND ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS ARE UBIQUITOUS IN INNER SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES. ABUNDANCES AND DISTRIBUTIONS OF REE IN THESE MAFIC AND ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS PROVIDE IMPORTANT CLUES TO UNDERSTANDING THE CHEMICAL AND THERMAL EVOLUTION OF PLANETARY INTERIORS THROUGH TIME. THIS PROPOSED STUDY IS DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THE SCOPES OF SOLAR SYSTEM WORKINGS BY PRODUCING NEW MINERAL-MELT REE PARTITIONING DATA AND DEVELOPING THREE NEW THERMOMETERS FOR PLANETARY MATERIALS, BY EXAMINING THE MEASURED SM-ND AGES OF LUNAR HIGHLANDS  SAMPLES, THE BY ANALYZING PLANETARY MATERIALS, AND BY PROVIDING NEW METHODS FOR ASSESSING THE THERMAL AND CHEMICAL EVOLUTION OF PLANETARY MANTLE AND LITHOSPHERE. METHODOLOGY: LABORATORY CRYSTAL GROWTH EXPERIMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED IN THE SYSTEM PLAGIOCLASE-PYROXENE-BASALT OVER A RANGE OF TEMPERATURES (1050#tilde#1400 C), PRESSURES (0#tilde#2 GPA), AND (EVOLVED) MELT COMPOSITIONS. MAJOR AND TRACE ELEMENT ABUNDANCES IN QUENCHED RUN PRODUCTS WILL BE ANALYZED USING AN ELECTRON MICROPROBE AND A LASER ABLATION INDUCTIVELY COUPLED PLASMA MASS SPECTROMETRY (LA-ICP-MS) AT BROWN UNIVERSITY. TOGETHER WITH PUBLISHED HIGH QUALITY PLAGIOCLASE-MELT AND PYROXENE-MELT TRACE ELEMENT PARTITIONING DATA, WE WILL DEVELOP INTERNALLY CONSISTENT LATTICE STRAIN MODELS FOR REE PARTITIONING IN THE AFOREMENTIONED MINERAL-MELT SYSTEMS USING A NONLINEAR LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION METHOD. WITH LABORATORY CALIBRATED TEMPERATURE- AND COMPOSITION-DEPENDENT MINERAL-MINERAL REE PARTITIONING MODELS, WE WILL BE ABLE TO CALCULATE TEMPERATURES FOR THE MAFIC AND ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS USING MEASURED PLAGIOCLASEPYROXENE REE PARTITION COEFFICIENTS. WE WILL ASSESS EFFECTS OF DISEQUILIBRIUM CRYSTALLIZATION, DIFFUSION AND SUBSOLIDUS RE-EQUILIBRATION ON REE ABUNDANCES IN COEXISTING PLAGIOCLASE AND PYROXENES IN THE CUMULATE SAMPLES THROUGH NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS AND EXAMINE THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR THE MEASURED SM-ND AGES AND INFERRED PARENTAL MELT COMPOSITIONS. AS PART OF PLANETARY APPLICATIONS, WE PLAN TO MEASURE REE AND OTHER ELEMENT ABUNDANCES IN COEXISTING PLAGIOCLASE AND PYROXENES IN SELECTED LUNAR SAMPLES, MARTIAN AND HED METEORITES, AS WELL AS MAFIC AND ULTRAMAFIC CUMULATES FROM THE BUSHVELD LAYERED INTRUSION USING THE LA-ICP-MS AND ELECTRON MICROPROBE.

KNOWLEDGE OF THE HELIOCENTRIC DISTANCE AND SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS OF CC PARENT BODIES WILL GREATLY CONTRIBUTE TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRIMORDIAL DISTRIBUTION AND LATER MOVEMENT OF RAW MATERIALS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. FOR IDENTIFYING SUCH CC PARENT BODIES, VISIBLE AND INFRARED (VIR) REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY EXTENDING TO ABOUT 4 MICRON IN WAVELENGTH IS ONE OF THE MOST USEFUL TECHNIQUES.

THE CHIP AND PELLET SAMPLES WILL ALSO BE IRRADIATED WITH PULSE LASER TO SIMULATE SW, AND THEIR VIR SPECTRAL CHANGES WILL BE STUDIED. BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE SPECTRA OVER THE 3-MICRON HYDRATION BAND RANGE WILL BE OBTAINED BY MEASURING EACH SAMPLE AFTER HEATING IT AT 200 C IN VACUUM TO REMOVE THE EFFECT OF ADSORBED WATER AND EXTRAPOLATING THE SPECTRAL CHANGE. IN ADDITION X-RAY DIFFRACTION MEASUREMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED ON THE PELLET SAMPLES BEFORE AND AFTER PULSE-LASER IRRADIATION TO SEE ANY CHANGES IN THE MINERAL ASSEMBLAGE. THE OBTAINED VIR SPECTRA WILL BE ANALYZED TO DERIVE A SET OF SPECTRAL PARAMETERS AS INDICES FOR PARTICLE SIZE AND SW DEGREE AND THEIR PHASE ANGLE DEPENDENCE. THE DATA WILL ALSO BE COMPARED WITH ASTEROID SPECTRA TAKEN BY AKARI TO DEMONSTRATE IDENTIFYING THEIR METEORITE COUNTERPARTS AND POSSIBLY DETECT ADSORBED WATER. IN THIS MANNER, THIS STUDY WILL CREATE A VALUABLE DATABASE AND A SET OF KEY SPECTRAL PARAMETERS FOR IDENTIFYING CC PARENT BODIES THROUGH GROUND-BASED TELESCOPIC OBSERVATIONS OR SPACECRAFT MISSIONS. OUR WORK IS RELEVANT TO THIS PROGRAM IN THAT IT WILL ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING OF PRIMITIVE MATERIALS AND VOLATILES IN THE FORMATION AND EARLY EVOLUTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM, CONSISTENT WITH THE GOALS OF THE EMERGING WORLDS PROGRAM AND NASA S PARTICULAR INTEREST IN RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT CLOSELY SUPPORT ITS MISSION OF EXPLORING THE SOLAR SYSTEM, SUCH AS OSIRIS-REX."

MUCH OF THAT EVIDENCE HAS COME FROM VISIBLE TO NEAR-INFRARED (VNIR) SPECTROSCOPY.  BY COMPARING THE MINERALS DETECTED BY VNIR SPECTROSCOPY TO TERRESTRIAL ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THESE MINERALS FORM, WE START TO UNDERSTAND THE RANGE OF PAST AQUEOUS ENVIRONMENTS THAT EXISTED ON MARS. HOWEVER, ONE OF THE MAJOR LIMITATIONS OF VNIR SPECTROSCOPY IS HOW IT RESPONDS TO MIXTURES OF MINERALS. MINERALS WITH STRONG OPTICAL CONSTANTS CAN OBSCURE THE VNIR SIGNATURES OF MINERALS WITH WEAK CONSTANTS, EVEN IF THE SECOND MINERAL EXISTS IN MUCH GREATER ABUNDANCE. THIS SPECTRAL MASKING EFFECT CAN COMPLICATE THE INTERPRETATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ON MARS, BECAUSE KEY MINERAL ASSEMBLAGES CAN BE OBSCURED. AN IMPORTANT EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE CASE OF IRON-BEARING OXYHYDROXIDES AND SULFATES, WHICH HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AT SEVERAL LOCATIONS ON THE MARTIAN SURFACE, AND ARE OFTEN USED AS MARKERS OF LIQUID WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, ENVIRONMENTAL INTERPRETATIONS ON THE BASIS OF HYDRATED IRON MINERALS ARE ONLY USEFUL TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN ESTIMATE THEIR ABUNDANCE AND DISTRIBUTION IN GEOLOGIC AND GEOGRAPHIC CONTEXT. BECAUSE THEY FORM IN SIMILAR ENVIRONMENTS  AND OFTEN ARE PRODUCTS OF EACH OTHER THEY LIKELY OCCUR ON MARS IN MIXTURES, MAKING IT IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THE SPECTRAL APPEARANCE OF MIXTURES OF IRON OXIDE AND IRON SULFATE MINERALS IN THE VNIR. HERE, WE PROPOSE TO STUDY TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF MIXTURES ON THE VNIR SPECTRA OF IRON OXYHYDROXIDES AND ON VNIR SPECTRA FROM MARS. OBJECTIVE: REFINE CAPABILITIES TO ASSESS MINERALOGY OF MARTIAN VNIR SPECTRA IN TERMS OF MIXTURES OF IRON OXYHYDROXIDES AND IRON SULFATE MINERALS.  METHODOLOGY: VNIR SPECTRA FROM NASA''S SATELLITE-BORNE COMPACT RECONNAISSANCE IMAGING SPECTROMETER FOR MARS (CRISM) WILL BE COMPARED TO SPECTRA OF LABORATORY MIXTURES OF IRON OXYHYDROXIDES AND IRON SULFATES, AND TO NATURAL SAMPLES. THE LABORATORY MIXTURES WILL BE PREPARED AND ANALYZED WITH A VNIR SPECTROMETER AND X-RAY DIFFRACTOMETER, WITH THE GOAL OF IDENTIFYING THE COMPOSITION AT WHICH A MINERAL (X) WILL SPECTRALLY MASK ANOTHER (Y). ONCE THE COMPOSITION AT WHICH X IS MASKED IN AN XY MIXTURE IS DETERMINED, THEN GRAIN SIZES OF X WILL BE VARIED IN THE MIXTURES TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF GRAIN SIZE ON SPECTRAL MASKING. MIXTURES WILL BE COMPARED TO FIELD SAMPLES ALREADY OBTAINED FROM ACID MINE DRAINAGE SYSTEMS IN SOUTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA AND RIO TINTO, SPAIN. FINALLY, THE LABORATORY MIXTURES AND NATURAL SAMPLES WILL BE COMPARED TO CRISM SPECTRA FROM MARS OVER AREAS PREVIOUSLY MAPPED AS HAVING IRON OXYHYDROXIDES AND IRON SULFATES.  RELEVANCE: THE PROPOSED STUDY IS RELEVANT TO MDAP, AS IT FOCUSES ON ENHANCING THE RETURNS FROM THE CRISM INSTRUMENT ABOARD MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (MRO). WE PROPOSE TO ANALYZE PUBLICLY-RELEASED DATA FROM THE CRISM INSTRUMENT. SPECIFICALLY, THIS PROGRAM WILL INVOLVE, \ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON OF MARS ORBITAL AND SURFACE DATA TO INCREASE THE PREDICTIVE ACCURACY OF SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS OF MARS FROM ORBIT.\""  SIGNIFICANCE: THIS WORK WILL ALLOW OTHER MARS RESEARCHERS TO MORE ACCURATELY DESCRIBE THE MINERALOGY OF COMPLEX SITES ON MARS, INCLUDING POTENTIAL NEW LANDING SITES FOR FUTURE MISSIONS. ADDITIONALLY, IT WILL CONTINUE THE WORK OF LINKING TERRESTRIAL AND MARTIAN LOW TEMPERATURE GEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES, AND OF USING EARTH ANALOG ENVIRONMENTS TO UNDERSTAND PAST ENVIRONMENTS ON MARS."""

MANY OF THESE IMPACTS HAVE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CLIMATE FEEDBACKS REGIONALLY AND GLOBALLY. CHARACTERIZING ARCTIC CHANGES ON SYNOPTIC SCALES, GIVEN LOGISTICAL AND WEATHER CONSTRAINTS, REQUIRES SATELLITE DATA. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT ARCTIC OCEAN REGIONAL-SCALE CH4 IS CORRELATED NEGATIVELY WITH FRACTIONAL ICE COVER ON SEASONAL AND AN INTER-ANNUAL BASES. MOREOVER, THERE IS EVIDENCE FORM IASI THAT CH4 IS INCREASING, SUCH AS A COMPARISON BETWEEN CH4 MAPS FOR NOVEMBER IN 2008 AND 2012. OUR MAIN HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE ARCTIC OCEAN IS A REGIONAL CH4 SOURCE WITH SEA ICE COVER EITHER COMPLETELY OR PARTIALLY BLOCKS THESE FLUXES, IN AGREEMENT WITH GEOLOGIC EVIDENCE (SEVERINGHAUS&BROOK 1999) AND RECENT ARCTIC OCEAN DATA (SHAKHOVA ET AL 2010A;B). INCREASED ICE-FREE ARCTIC CONDITIONS WILL RESULT IN RISING ARCTIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO GLOBAL CH4 BUDGETS EVEN WITHOUT SOURCE EMISSION STRENGTH GROWTH. TERRA AND AQUA INSTRUMENTS PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT DATA (SST, ALGAE, CDOM, ICE COVER) FOR TESTING THIS HYPOTHESIS WHEN COMBINED WITH CH4 ATMOSPHERIC COLUMN ABUNDANCES, DERIVED FROM IASI. THE IASI SPECTRAL RESOLUTION ALLOWS AN AVERAGING KERNEL TO DERIVE LOWER CH4 (600 MB) THAN THE COARSER SPECTRAL RESOLUTION AIRS DATA (400 MB). OCEAN COLOR MODIS DATA IS FUSED WITH VIIRS AND CRIS. IN THIS PROJECT WE WILL ASSEMBLE AND FUSE THE ARCTIC DATA SOURCES FOR CH4 (IASI AND AIRS) AND SEA ICE COVER (MODIS, MASIE-NH). WE DERIVE CLOUD MASKS FROM MODIS DATA USING A NEW APPROACH AND THE STANDARD CLOUD PRODUCT. THE BOUNDARY LAYER WILL BE DERIVED DIRECTLY FROM CALIPSO AEROSOL DATA, AND INDIRECTLY FROM MODIS AND AMSR-E SST AND CLOUD TOP TEMPERATURES TO DERIVE A LAPSE RATE. BOUNDARY LAYER INFORMATION (WHICH LARGELY CONFINES THE CH4 (SHAKHOVA ET AL 2010A) WILL IMPROVE CH4 RETRIEVALS FROM AIRS/IASI THROUGH BETTER ADDRESSING THERMAL PROFILE CONTRAST EFFECTS. THIS STUDY ADDRESSES KEY SCIENCE QUESTIONS: 1. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT SST POORLY CHARACTERIZES UPPER ARCTIC OCEAN WATER-COLUMN WARMING AND THAT PARAMETERS LIKE ALGAL OCEAN COLOR, SEA ICE PERSISTENCE, AND SEABED CH4 EMISSIONS ARE BETTER CORRELATED. 2. HOW DOES THE MARINE ARCTIC CH4 CONTRIBUTION AND GROWTH COMPARE WITH TERRESTRIAL CH4 ARCTIC CONTRIBUTION AND GROWTH LEADING TO ACCELERATING AND REGIONALLY SIGNIFICANT ARCTIC WARMING? 3. WHAT ARE THE TEMPORAL (SEASONAL AND INTER-ANNUAL) TRENDS OF THESE SOURCES AND EMISSIONS? 4. HOW DOES VARIABILITY IN OCEAN PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS AND PRODUCTIVITY RELATE TO SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE, WATER COLUMN STABILITY (HEATING, ICE MELT, RIVERINE AND PRECIPITATION INPUTS), AND PHOTOSYNTHETICALLY ACTIVE RADIATION (PAR) RELATE TO ICE-FREE PERIODS? HOW DO THESE TEMPERATURE-INFLUENCED PARAMETERS CORRELATE WITH CH4 EMISSIONS? 5. HOW DO THE INTER-ANNUAL TRENDS IN ICE COVER (FROM MODIS, AVHRR, AND VARIOUS MICROWAVE SATELLITE DATA) RELATE TO PARAMETERS KNOWN TO VARY WITH WATER COLUMN TEMPERATURE AND SST? IN THIS STUDY, WE WILL PROVIDE: 1. HISTORICAL TRENDS OF KEY ARCTIC PARAMETERS TO BE ANALYZED WITH PUBLISHED HISTORICAL TRENDS IN ARCTIC OCEAN TEMPERATURES TO IDENTIFY THE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT HEAT INPUT SOURCES ON CLIMACTIC AND OTHER TEMPORAL SCALES (EL NINO, ECONOMIC CYCLES, SEASONAL E.G., SPRING THAW, ETC.). 2. DIFFERENT SOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS IN BOTH THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DOMAINS WILL BE IDENTIFIED USING PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS AND OTHER STATISTICAL APPROACHES. 3. GUIDANCE FOR FUTURE ARCTIC TIR CH4 SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING DESIGN WILL BE PROVIDED BY COMPARISON OF AIRS AND IASI-DERIVED CH4 ABUNDANCE FOCUSING ON THE RELATIVE MERITS OF DIFFERENT CH4 ABSORPTION FEATURES. 4. COMPARISON BETWEEN AIRS V6, IASI (NOAA AND OTHER RETRIEVAL ALGORITHMS) AND GOSAT CH4 DATA AT MID-UPPER LATITUDES."

CONCEPTUALLY, THE SOUL IS A TOOL ON THE END OF TENS OF METERS LONG ROBOTIC ARM WITH INFINITE DEGREES OF FREEDOM (FLEXIBLE UMBILICAL) THAT CAN ACCESS LOCATIONS UNREACHABLE BY CONVENTIONAL ROBOTIC ARMS. THE INITIAL PURPOSE OF THE USAF AND NAVY FUNDED SOUL DEVELOPMENT WAS REMOVAL OF LARGE SPACE DEBRIS (1000KG CLASS). UNDER THIS PROGRAM, THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUL VEHICLE WAS EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL. THE SOUL, TESTED ON A AIR TABLE, AUTONOMOUSLY RECOGNIZED SIMULATED DEBRIS, ESTIMATED ITS POSE RELATIVE TO THE TARGET (FUSING VISIBLE, IR IMAGES AND IMU INFORMATION), PLANNED A PATH TO THE DEBRIS AND EXECUTED THE PATH AND THE TOUCHED THE TARGET WITH MINIMAL MOMENTUM TRANSFER. IN PHASE 1 OF THE PRESENT PROGRAM, BUSEK DESIGNED, BUILD AND TESTED A WINCH THAT IS THE KEY PART OF THE SOUL DEPLOYMENT AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEM, PANNING OUT OR REELING IN THE UMBILICAL LINE. IN THE PROPOSED PHASE 2 EFFORT BUSEK WILL BUILD THE ENTIRE SOUL SYSTEM CONSISTING OF THE SOUL VEHICLE, UMBILICAL, THE DEPLOYMENT/RETRIEVAL SYSTEM AND THE COMMAND MODULE. THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WILL BE HOUSED FOR LAUNCH IN A 6U CUBESAT DEPLOYER WHICH WILL ALSO STOW SOUL WHEN INACTIVE. DEMONSTRATION OF THE INTEGRATED SYSTEM INCLUDING THE 6U DEPLOYER WILL BE PERFORMED ON THE AIR TABLE. THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO MAKE A FLIGHT WORTHY SYSTEM AND DEMONSTRATE IT ON THE ISS. FLIGHT READINESS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY QUALIFYING PROGRAM ON THE PHASE 2 HARDWARE."

THE RELATION BETWEEN MBH AND STELLAR-VELOCITY DISPERSION (SIGMA) IS CONSIDERED THE TIGHTEST AND THUS THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL. IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE CALIBRATION OF MBH IN AGNS. HOWEVER, WHEN SIGMA IS DETERMINED FROM FIBER-BASED OR LONG-SLIT SPECTROSCOPY, SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY IS INTRODUCED, WITH DEVIATIONS UP TO 40%, DEPENDING ON THE APERTURE USED, DRIVEN BY EFFECTS OF INCLINATION, THE PRESENCE OF A KINEMATICALLY COLD BUT ROTATING DISK AND AN AGN POWER-LAW CONTINUUM OUTSHINING THE UNDERLYING STELLAR ABSORPTION LINES. 3D SPECTROSCOPY IS THE ONLY WAY FORWARD FOR A PRECISE MEASUREMENT OF SIGMA. AT THE SAME TIME, REVERBERATION MAPPING (RM) PROVIDES THE MOST RELIABLE MBH FOR BROAD-LINE AGNS. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RM AGN SAMPLE CANNOT BE OVERSTATED: IT SERVES AS A MBH CALIBRATOR FOR THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE. TO COMPLEMENT 20 NEW, MASSIVE RM AGNS FOR WHICH WE HAVE RECENTLY OBTAINED VLT/ MUSE AND/OR KECK/KCWI 3D SPECTRA, WE HERE PROPOSE TO ANALYSE 13 RM AGNS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE KECK OBSERVATORY ARCHIVE (KOA), HST, AND 2MASS. KOA, HST AND 2MASS ARE PROJECTS/MISSIONS WITH A SIGNIFICANT NASA CONTRIBUTION AND CAN THUS SERVE AS A PRIMARY DATA SOURCE FOR AN ADAP PROPOSAL. SPATIALLY-RESOLVED SIGMA WILL BE DERIVED BY ANALYZING CO ABSORPTION LINES IN NEARINFRARED ADAPTIVE-OPTICS ASSISTED 3D KECK/OSIRIS SPECTRA. THESE SPECTRA ENABLE MEASUREMENTS OF THE STELLAR KINEMATICS DOWN TO THE CENTRAL 100-200 PC. GIVEN THE LOWER LUMINOSITY OF THIS SAMPLE AND THUS THE SMALL BULGE SIZES, SUCH A RESOLUTION IS ESSENTIAL. WE WILL USE A DEBLENDING TECHNIQUE TO SUBTRACT THE UNRESOLVED AGN EMISSION FROM THE NUCLEAR SPECTRA. FOR A PRECISE MEASUREMENT OF HOST GALAXY PROPERTIES, WE WILL ANALYZE ARCHIVAL HST IMAGES. IN PREVIOUS LITERATURE STUDIES, THE EMPHASIS WAS ON THE HOST-GALAXY FREE AGN LUMINOSITY, THAT IS DISENTANGLING HOST AND AGN, FOR THE CREATION OF THE RELATION BETWEEN BROAD-LINE REGION RADIUS AND AGN LUMINOSITY. HERE, WE WILL RE-ANALYZE THE SAMPLE FOCUSING ON OBTAINING A ROBUST MEASUREMENT OF THE EFFECTIVE BULGE RADIUS. MOREOVER, THIS WILL ENSURE A HOMOGENEOUS IMAGE ANALYSIS. WE WILL USE OUR NEW CODE LENSTRONOMY WHICH SUPERSEDES GALFIT BY USING AN MCMC TECHNIQUE TO PROVIDE REALISTIC ERRORS AND EXPLORE THE COVARIANCE BETWEEN THE VARIOUS MODEL PARAMETERS. WE WILL APPLY THE SAME HOST-GALAXY DECOMPOSITION TO K-BAND 2MASS IMAGES WHICH ARE LESS AFFECTED BY EXTINCTION AND COVER THE SAME WAVELENGTH RANGE AS THE OSIRIS SPECTRA. HST AND 2MASS IMAGES ARE THUS COMPLEMENTARY AND INFORM EACH OTHER. FITTING THE CORRECT MODEL IS NOT ONLY IMPORTANT FOR PROPER MORPHOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION, BUT ESPECIALLY FOR THE EFFECTIVE RADIUS MEASUREMENT WHICH IN TURN AFFECTS SIGMA. WHEN COMBINED WITH THE 20 LUMINOUS RM AGNS, OUR SAMPLE WILL HAVE THE MOST ROBUST MBH AND SIGMA MEASUREMENTS OF AGNS IN THE UNIVERSE, SPREADING A WIDE RANGE OF MASSES AND HOST GALAXY PROPERTIES. WE WILL PROBE THE SLOPE OF THE MBH-SIGMA RELATION, ITS INTERCEPT AND SCATTER, CONSTRAIN THE AVERAGE F FACTOR, AND STUDY DEPENDENCIES OF THE RELATION ON LUMINOSITY, EDDINGTON RATIO AND HOSTGALAXY MORPHOLOGY - ALL ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS FOR ROBUST MBH ESTIMATES FOR QUASARS IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE."

THE SPACECRAFT WOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH A HIGH-POWER LASER AND AN INFRARED SPECTROMETER, BOTH POWERED BY PHOTOVOLTAICS. THE LASER IS DIRECTED AT A SPOT ON THE TARGET, WITH CENTRAL FLUX IN THE 10 MW/M2 RANGE. FOR ROCKY TARGETS, MELTING AND EVAPORATION OF SURFACE AND SHALLOW SUB-SURFACE MATERIAL OCCURS. DUE TO PHASE CHANGES, THE SPOT TEMPERATURE RAPIDLY EQUILIBRATES AT #tilde#2500 K, BUT THE FLUX IS INSUFFICIENT TO DISSOCIATE MOST MOLECULAR SPECIES PRESENT. BLACKBODY RADIATION PRODUCED BY THE HEATED SPOT PEAKS NEAR 1 UM, AND TRAVELS OUTWARD THROUGH THE EVAPORATED PLUME. FORTUITOUSLY, THE EQUILIBRATION TEMPERATURE OF THE HEATED SPOT EMITS PEAK RADIATION RIGHT IN THE SPECTRAL RANGE WHERE ABSORPTION OCCURS DUE TO MOLECULAR ROTATIONAL AND VIBRATIONAL MODES. THE HEATED SPOT IS VIEWED BY THE SPECTROMETER THROUGH THE PLUME, AND ABSORPTION LINES CAN BE EXPLOITED TO INFER THE MOLECULAR COMPOSITION OF THE TARGET. THE REMOTE SENSING SYSTEM USES AN ARTIFICIAL BACKLIGHTED SOURCE, AND RELIES ON ABSORPTION OF RADIOMETRIC ENERGY TO DETERMINE MOLECULAR COMPOSITION OF THE TARGET, SUGGESTING THE DESIGNATION REMOTE LASER EVAPORATIVE MOLECULAR ABSORPTION (R-LEMA) SPECTROSCOPY SENSOR SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM IS COMPLEMENTARY TO EXISTING METHODS SUCH AS LASER-INDUCED BREAKDOWN SPECTROSCOPY (LIBS). THE LIBS LASER PRODUCES SUFFICIENT FLUX TO VAPORIZE AND IONIZE THE TARGET MATERIAL; THE LIBS OPTICAL SPECTROMETER OBSERVES CHARACTERISTIC EMISSION FROM MATERIALS IN THE PLASMA, ALLOWING DETERMINATION OF THE ATOMIC COMPOSITION OF THE TARGET.OUR PHASE I EFFORTS PRODUCED AN END-TO-END MODEL OF THE SENSOR SYSTEM, AND SIMULATED OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS WERE EXPLORED. THE MODEL INCLUDES LASER PROPAGATION AND ABSORPTION BY A SIMULATED TARGET. ABSORPTION OF LASER ENERGY DRIVES HEATING, MELTING AND EVAPORATION OF THE TARGET MATERIAL. EVAPORATION IN SPACE ENVIRONMENT CONDITIONS IS PREDICTED, LEADING TO ESTIMATES OF PLUME DENSITY IN FRONT OF THE HEATED SPOT. FINALLY, PLUME CHARACTERISTICS ARE USED TO CALCULATE THE EXPECTED ABSORPTION SPECTRUM AT THE SPECTROMETER. ADDITIONALLY, PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS WERE PERFORMED TO TEST SOME ASPECTS OF THE MODEL, INCLUDING PLUME DENSITY AND ABSORPTION. ALL RESULTS OBTAINED DURING PHASE I INDICATE THAT THE PROPOSED SENSOR SYSTEM CONCEPT IS VIABLE. WE ESTIMATE THE SENSOR SYSTEM CONCEPT TO BE TRL-2 AT THE CULMINATION OF PHASE I. THE PHASE II EFFORT WOULD POTENTIALLY PUSH THE SYSTEM CONCEPT FROM TRL-2 TO TRL-4, BY BUILDING A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT LABORATORY MODEL AND RUNNING EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTS TO TEST THE THEORY DEVELOPED IN PHASE I. IN PARTICULAR, PHASE I RESULTS SUGGEST THE HEATED SPOT WILL PRODUCE SUFFICIENT BLACKBODY FLUX TO BE VIEWED FROM A DISTANCE, I.E., FLUX IS NOT THE LIMITING COMPONENT OF THE SYSTEM. PHASE I RESULTS ALSO SUGGEST THAT MUCH OF THE ABSORPTION OCCURS WITHIN ABOUT ONE SPOT RADIUS FROM THE TARGET. THUS, SPECTRAL DETECTION IS LIMITED PRIMARILY BY EJECTA CONCENTRATION, WHICH IS IN TURN CONTROLLED BY THE SPOT AREA WHERE SUFFICIENT FLUX IS DELIVERED TO PRODUCE EVAPORATION. ANY OPERATIONAL SYSTEM SHOULD THEREFORE SEEK TO MAXIMIZE EVAPORATIVE SPOT AREA WITH AVAILABLE LASER POWER.FOR THE PHASE II EFFORT, WE PROPOSE TO EXECUTE ADVANCED LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS TO MEASURE PARAMETERS OF INTEREST, AND TO COMPARE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS TO ANALYTICAL PREDICTIONS THAT WERE DEVELOPED IN PHASE I. THE PHASE II EFFORT WOULD POTENTIALLY PUSH THE SYSTEM CONCEPT FROM TRL-2 TO TRL-4. DURING THE PHASE II GRANT PERIOD, WE WOULD ALSO DEVELOP A ROADMAP TO TRL-5, BY SPECIFYING A CUBESAT EXPERIMENT THAT COULD BE EXECUTED IN LOW-EARTH ORBIT, OVER A MODEST DISTANCE IN THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT."

M. KECK OBSERVATORY (WMKO) IS FOR RENEWAL OF THE COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT AWARD FOR SUPPORT OF NASA MISSIONS AND NASA SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AT WMKO, WHICH OPERATES THE WORLD S TWO (2) LARGEST STEERABLE OPTICAL AND INFRARED TELESCOPES ON THE SUMMIT OF MAUNAKEA ON THE ISLAND OF HAWAII. NASA UTILIZES ONE-SIXTH OF THE ANNUAL OPERATION CAPABILITY OF WMKO, HAVING INVESTED ONE-SIXTH OF THE CAPITAL COSTS AND ONE-SIXTH OF THE OPERATIONS COSTS SINCE CIRCA 1996. THERE HAS BEEN A WEALTH OF SCIENTIFIC RESULTS COMING FROM THE DYNAMIC SCIENTIFIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NASA MISSIONS SUCH AS HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE (HST), SPITZER, KEPLER, K2, CHANDRA, HERSCHEL, WISE, GALEX, VOYAGER, GALILEO, DEEP IMPACT, CASSINI, NEW HORIZONS, AND THE KECK OBSERVATORY. WE PROPOSE HERE TO EXTEND THAT PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP TO FUTURE NASA MISSIONS; JWST, TESS, WFIRST, EUCLID, MARS 2020, AND OTHER MIDEX, SMEX, DISCOVERY, AND NEW FRONTIERS MISSIONS. THE LINK BETWEEN NASA AND WMKO IS POWERFUL. NASA S SPACE BASED DISCOVERIES INFORM AND ARE INFORMED BY THE FINDINGS OF ITS GROUND BASED PARTNER, THE W. M. KECK OBSERVATORY. NASA RELATED PROJECTS ARE PROPOSED BY THE US COMMUNITY TO NEXSCI AND ARE AWARDED OBSERVING TIME PROVIDED BY NASA. THIS HAS PROVEN PRODUCTIVE IN THE PAST. A PRIME EXAMPLE IS WHEN KEPLER DISCOVERED OBJECTS TRANSITING STARS, WMKO UNDERTOOK KEY OBSERVATIONS THAT ESTABLISHED THAT THE CANDIDATE EXOSOLAR PLANETS WERE INDEED VALID EXOSOLAR PLANETS, AND MEASURED THEIR MASSES, LEADING TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ONE OF NASA S LEVEL 1 SCIENCE GOALS: MAKING A CENSUS OF PLANETARY SYSTEMS DOWN TO THE LEVEL OF EARTH-SIZED PLANETS. WHEN SPITZER AND HST BOTH DETECTED AN OBJECT IN THE DISTANT UNIVERSE, WMKO DELIVERED THE EXACT REDSHIFT OF 8.68, WELL WITHIN THE REGION THAT WAS THOUGHT TO BE THE DARK AGE BEFORE REIONIZATION. THE RESEARCH PROGRAM ENABLED BY THE NASA/WMKO PARTNERSHIP MAPS DIRECTLY TO THE ASTROPHYSICAL AND PLANETARY PRIORITIES OF NASA: THE ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF THE UNIVERSE, THE PROCESSES FOR LIFE ON OTHER PLANETS, THE PROCESSES OF FORMATION OF STARS, GALAXIES, AND PLANETS, AND THE CONTENT, ORIGIN, AND EVOLUTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND THE POTENTIAL FOR LIFE ELSEWHERE. THE SCOPE OF THE ASTROPHYSICS AND PLANETARY SCIENCE IS BREATHTAKING, RANGING FROM THE BIRTH OF THE UNIVERSE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF STARS AND GALAXIES OVER COSMIC TIME, TO THE SEARCH FOR LIFE ON PLANETS AROUND OTHER STARS, TO THE FORMATION, EVOLUTION, AND POSSIBILITY OF LIFE ON OTHER PLANETS IN OUR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM. THE TWO 10-METER PRIMARY APERTURES, DIVERSE INSTRUMENT SUITE INCLUDING ADAPTIVE OPTICS AND THE SUPERB LOCATION ON MAUNAKEA MAKE WMKO AN EXTRAORDINARILY POWERFUL AND UNIQUE FACILITY FOR ADDRESSING THE RESEARCH AREAS DESCRIBED ABOVE. ADDITIONALLY, WMKO CAN REACT QUICKLY TO NASA MISSION NEEDS, REARRANGING NIGHTS ON SHORT NOTICE. THE TRACK RECORD OF DISCOVERIES BY SCIENTISTS USING THE WMKO IN CONJUNCTION WITH NASA MISSIONS OVER THE LAST TWO (2) DECADES GIVES STRONG TESTIMONY TO THAT CASE. THE PROGRAM CORRESPONDING TO NASA S IN-GUIDE FUNDING AMOUNT PROVIDES NASA ONE-SIXTH OF WMKO OPERATIONS SUPPORT AND, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE NASA EXOPLANET SCIENCE INSTITUTE (NEXSCI), WMKO WILL CONTINUE ITS KECK OBSERVATORY ARCHIVE (KOA) ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, WE SUBMIT HERE AN OVER-GUIDE THAT ALLOWS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF DATA REDUCTION PIPELINES (DRPS) OVER A PERIOD OF FIVE (5) YEARS, TO SPEED THE REDUCTION OF NEW DATA WITH IMPROVED TOOLS AND TO ACCESS THE INFORMATION INHERENT IN 25 YEARS OF  THE KECK SKY  EASILY AND EFFICIENTLY FOR ALL USERS.
