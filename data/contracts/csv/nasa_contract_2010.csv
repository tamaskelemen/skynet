Main Thrust: Continue improvement of the fabrication as well as testing carbon based materials for applications in Space Propulsion, Power Generation as well as Thermal Shielding. In this work we will focus our efforts on the fabrication of GPC composites ware and measure the Mechanical properties, measure thermal conductivity, and other physical properties of the nanomaterials inclusion in the precursor of glassy polymeric carbon (GPC). During the second stage of this project, we will initiate a study of the keV and MeV irradiation of produced GPC composites, as well as testing the erosion resistance of the fabricated coupons in hot hydrogen environment by our colleagues at MSFC. We will introduce nanopowder of Multi-Walled Carbon Nano Tubes (MWNT), nanopowder of Alumina (Al2O3) and nanopowder of Silicon Carbide (Sic) in the precursor resin in order to produce the desire properties of such materials to operate in extreme environment of high radiation, hot hydrogen (500 C to 3000 C), and measure the thermal, electrical and mechanical properties of the GPC composite materials&compare such results with pure GPC. Consideration: High temperature hydrogen and radiation hardened systems: Investigate the effect of nano-materials mixing in the carbon based system (possible usage in the moderator, heterogeneous thermal reactors with separate fuel and moderator, as well as usage as TPS). The size of these reactors is dependent on the efficiency of heat transfer, and performance of these systems is a function of the maximum fuel temperature, which is limited to between 2300 K and 3500 K. Major design considerations include selection of materials to avoid hot corrosion with multiple reactor restarts, and fuel element fabrication to retain fission products."""

The program is a unique partnership between afterschool programs and science museums. - Out-of-school program: After-School Math PLUS (ASM+) - Sponsoring organization: Educational Equity Center at AED (EEC/AED) - Year program was established: Pilot-2003; National replication: 2006-2010 - Geographical locations: Pilot: New York, NY; St Louis, MO; Louisville, KY; National Replication: Huntsville, AL, Bangor, ME, Martinsville, VA; Albuquerque, NM; Stilwell, OK - Targeted participants: Students in grades 3-8 underserved in STEM  - Number of students served: Annually-l00-150; to-date-750-1000 - Student-to-staff ratio: 20: 1-2 - Program content theme: ASM+ incorporates math skills/concepts through four themes common to afterschool-Jump Rope Math (sports);The Built Environment (social justice), ArtMath and Music Math. - Program partners: ASM+ is a partnership between afterschool programs and science museums. Pilot partners were the New York Hall of Science/Chinese American Planning Council Program in New York; St. Louis Science Center/Adams School Community Center in St Louis, MO; and the Louisville Science Center/ Whitney Scholars program for 7th/Sth grade students in Louisville, KY. With funding from Toyota USA, ASM+ has been replicated at four sites: Maine Discovery CenterlIndian Island School Afterschool Program in Bangor, ME; the US Space & Rocket Center/University Place School in Huntsville, AL; the Louisville Science CenterlDevers Youth Center at Fort Knox in KY; and the Virginia Museum of Natural HistorylHenry County After 3 Collaborative in Martinsville, VA. ASM+ was further replicated with middle school American Indian students in Albuquerque, NM, and elementary students in Bangor, ME and Stilwell, OK. - Description of structure: In each ASM+ theme, students participate in a series of five hands-on activities at their afterschool program and, at a science museum, create an exhibit that displays the math ski1ls and content they have learned. An emphasis on careers and role models and a connection to literacy are integrated into each theme as are biographies of people who have chosen a related STEM career. The culminating event is a students exhibit at the science museum or a community site to which families are invited free of charge. For example: a. In Huntsville, 4th grade students from the University Place School worked with their in-school math teacher in an ASM+ afterschool math club. Students explored geometric patterns in the built environment of their center and the surrounding neighborhood. Then, they measured areas of their center and developed scaled blueprints of the dimensions. b. At the U.S. Space and Rocket Center, students used the skills they had gained to create a built-to-scale model of a Mars colony using found materials from NASA's space program. Students thought about what people would need to live on Mars. They built houses of worship (Church, Synagogue, and Mosque), a recreation center with gravitational pull in mind, and placed their buildings with regard to health and safety. The Mars Colony has become a permanent display at the Museum. One year later, the same students, now 5th graders were invited back to make a presentation. Their teacher, who thought he would need to refresh them about the work they had done, was pleasantly surprised to learn that they remembered all the math and every detail about building the Mars colony. c. In other ASM+ sites, students have built scale model charrettes of a tsunami-proof village, an accessible 2012 Olympic venue, an Indian village situated next to a river (Wabanaki Tribe) and a summer house (Cherokee Nation).

The Adler's goals are to inspire children to develop a lifelong interest in science, expand its cun''ent audience, address community needs in math and science education, reach out to fiunilies and encourage an interest in STEM careers. Nationwide research about the state of scientific literacy in America provides an additional, compelling argument for transfOIming how the Adler engages children and their parents in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) learning and education. With six billion people on Earth, only a handful of humans wil1 have the privilege of going into space and visiting other worlds. TIlOse who go become witnesses for the rest - the eyes and ears, the hearts and spirits for the rest of humanity. But it takes a diverse team of thousands of scientists, engineers, technology and math-savvy individuals to accomplish these goals. When humans eventual1y set foot on Mars with their eyes fixed on other planets and moons, it may be the greatest story of the 21st century. When the first man or woman creates those historic footprints, at that moment every human being will stand vicariously in those boots. The accomplishments of the entire team will be celebrated.  The Adler is preparing itself to engage its visitors in this journey and exhilarating dream by making space sciences accessible. Astronomy and cosmology are diflicult to grasp yet essential to preparing for (and understanding) space exploration missions. In a new exhibition titled Deep Space Adventure, the Adler will promote renewed interest in science, space exploration and STEM careers. The Adler also will provide children with an exciting museum experience to spark their enthusiasm for space exploration, science, math and technology, and encourage them to consider their roles in future space missions. Their generation inherits a great legacy from voyages and discoveries of earlier centuries. To engage them in STEM at an early age, the Adler is developing the Explorers'' Club exhibition.  Through renovated galleries featuring new exhibitions, the Adler will motivate children to grasp their futures as designers of missions to explore the mysteries of the universe, or as biologists who discover life on other worlds. The Adler's plans answer a nationwide call to catalyze children's interest in STEM, and provide them with quality science education experiences to prepare for the demands of the future workforce, and ensure America's future economic vitality."""

The samples, from the Moon, Mars, Earth and the asteroid Vesta (a possible dwarf planet) would be obtained as meteorites from reputable dealers and would be mounted under Lexan domes serving both to magnify the objects and prevent vandalism. Visitors could touch the samples with a bent finger. Simple text and graphic panels will explain how each of the featured worlds fits into the broader context of planetary formation. This exhibit will allow visitors an opportunity to make a physical connection to the other worlds of the Solar System. This direct connection is particularly timely given the upcoming Dawn arrival at Vesta, the planned return to the Moon, and ongoing Mars exploration. To enhance the experience, the Adler would produce short interactive video segments that highlight how these samples came to be on the Earth, what their history and context was on their world of origin and the human story of how they came to be found and recognized as originating on another world. Scientists from the Planetary Science Institute would serve as both consulting experts and on-camera talent for the video segments and text/graphics panels. The exhibit elements would be designed to be modular and expandable. Once the basic template (mount and graphic panel design, video system details, video script outline and style elements etc.) was completed the exhibit would be easy to expand to include other samples. Particularly intriguing possibilities include possible Mercurian meteorites, if these are confirmed, as well as samples of other asteroid types. Because the exhibit will be functional as a stand-alone exhibit rather than just a supplement to other exhibits, it will be well suited to replication by small planetaria and science museums. The cost for each copy will be limited to actual materials and labor associated with construction, approximately 4000 - 5000 dollars per exhibit station, and so will be affordable under smaller grants or community funding. We will seek out partner institutions and follow-on funding for replicating and distributing exhibits."""

Research will be conducted in the Brazilian and Peruvian Amazon, at sites near Manaus and Iquitos. Activities will build on and extend research conducted under NASA-funded LBA projects. Current approaches for sampling tropical tree diversity rely on field investigations that sample only a small portion of key environmental gradients. This project will bring together a close coupling of extensive field measurements of tree diversity patterns, satellite remote sensing to enable sampling across regional disturbance gradients, and community simulation models to better understand the mechanisms responsible for observed patterns at regional scales. The overarching hypothesis is that tree species community assembly patterns at the landscape scale, driven by episodic disturbance events, differ significantly from community assembly patterns at the local (<100 ha) scale. The project has four major goals: First, episodic tree mortality disturbance will be mapped over large Amazon landscapes using Landsat imagery, enabling the development of disturbance chronosequences covering more than 20 years. Second, the chronosequence data will be used to direct extensive field sampling to quantify tree species patterns across the landscape as a function of disturbance intensity, and time since disturbance. Third, the detection threshold for shifts in PFTs from the competitor to colonizer guild will be explored using hyperspectral (Hyperion) imagery. Fourth, a tractable community assembly model will be developed to explore which community assemblage mechanisms best fit the observed landscape-level patterns. Results will provide an improved understanding of shifts in tree diversity and PFTs with disturbance, and will help inform future NASA missions including DESDynI and HyspIRI. This project will directly address the stated goal of better understanding the current condition of Amazon forest biodiversity, and how it is changing over time."

However, we propose that it is exactly the magnetic field, or, more precisely, the balance of open and closed magnetic structures on local (supergranular, #tilde#20Mm) and global (coronal, >#tilde#100Mm) in the photosphere and chromosphere that defines the thermodynamic properties of coronal holes, providing a realistic basis to explore the support and sustenance of the kinetic solar wind. The chromosphere has been largely overlooked as a driving source of the solar wind despite its richness in emission and structure, largely due to the aforementioned complexity. Recently, we [McIntosh and Leamon ApJL, 624, 117, 2005] correlated the inferred topography of the solar chromospheric plasma with in situ solar wind velocity and composition data measured at 1 AU. Specifically, the measured separation in height of the TRACE 1600 and 1700 UV band pass filters correlate very strongly with solar wind velocity and inversely with the ratio of ionic oxygen (O7+/O6+) densities. These correlations suggest that the structure of the solar wind is rooted deeper in the solar atmosphere than has been previously considered and form the basis of an empirical solar wind model. The proposed model provides a near continuous range of solar wind speeds and composition quantities from the structure of the chromosphere and is more precise than the old fast/ coronal hole or slow/streamer belt"" estimate. By means of a coherent, planned and extended observation campaign of the solar chromosphere at disk center, we propose to extend our current results to better understand the nature of the solar wind, its sources and composition. One specific end goal for this three- year project is to develop a (near) real-time solar wind propagation model, with chromospheric topography as input. This useful tool for predictive space weather will have great impact in 2008 when we can replace the intermittent TRACE data with the full-disk, full-time chromospheric topography measurements of the first LWS mission, the Solar Dynamics Observatory. This proposal addresses Strategic Sub-goal 3B: ""Understand the Sun and its effects on Earth and the solar system,"" specifically NASA Science Outcomes 3B1 and 3B3. However, our improved physical understanding will yield a better observationally driven, physically based ability, to predict space weather on its own and as part of a community based collaborative model within the LWS program."""

Similarly, solar data are also heterogeneous; for example, full disk solar images, partial disk images, coronographic images, spectral data, NOAA active region numbers, sunspot classes, flare events, coronal mass ejections, scientific papers, etc. A previous Living with a Star Targeted Research and Technology (LWS TR&T award (NNH05DA001N/05-LWA05-163) has allowed the development of demonstration technology which allows for panning, scanning, zooming, multi-layering and labeling of full disk solar images.  We propose to further develop this technology by creating a web application to allow the intuitive presentation and access of heterogeneous solar and heliospheric data-sets and feature/event catalogs, both in time and space, at all the available time-scales and length-scales afforded by the observations. The overarching idea is to create a science exploration service to (1)allow the user to visually explore the state of the Sun and inner heliosphere at a given time (2)discover the features/events present and follow their time-dependence at all wavelengths, length-scales and time-scales, and to (3)be able find and download the relevant scientific literature and data, provided by the Harvard Astrophysical Data System and the Virtual Solar Observatory respectively. This technology will present a unified view of our Sun and inner heliosphere for the solar physics Virtural Solar Observatory community."

With continuously streaming data, 10 times the size of HD, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission will continue to play a key role in engaging the public in scientific exploration and discovery. For the past few years, the SDO EPO program has been developing and implementing a robust well-roundcd EPO program as an extension and complement to the NASA Education portfolio and overall Heliophysics and Living With a Star (LWS) Education and Public Outreach (EPO) efforts. We are proposing to continue current efforts, deepen our partnerships, and build upon the existing program by incorporating the unique solar data that will soon be available in order to continue infusing in the public a better understanding of the Sun's interior and magnetic activity and the Sun's role and influence on Earth and Space. Working closely with others at NASA, educators, families, science centers, community organizations, and professional organizations, SDO will continue developing initiatives that engage the public in scientific discoveries and technological achievements, improve the teaching and understanding of STEM disciplines and change perceptions among all audiences, increasing their science literacy with a focus on the Sun and the science of SDO through the continuation of our award wining family programs like the NASA Family Science Night, K-12 initiatives, and strong partnerships we can change people's perception of STEM disciplines and their importance in our every day lives.

Proposed Effort: From studies it has become obvious that the key enablers for future groundbreaking progress in GA are not only increased affordability but also other critical requirements such as improved performance and fuel efficiency; improved safety; ease of operation; drastic reduction of noise; acceptable performance specification. The design and development of new GA aircraft, with novel technologies for addressing these issues, represents a daunting challenge because of the scope of the radical design constraints due to the requirements of ease of manufacturing and maintenance, noise control, drastically improved safety, and efficiency. The proposed development of a scientifically based tool box for scaled model research, once validated for a typical GA aircraft such as the Cirrus SR22 with a relatively large scale model, will allow for drastically more cost-effective investigations of future GA aircraft concepts and will also considerably reduce the cost associated with the development and testing of novel technologies for GA . Specific key innovations associated with the proposed approach are; model as low-cost test-bed for future GA concept and technology development. Due to the relatively large scale to the validation model, chances are high that aerodynamic, dynamic and aeroelastic testing of critical design parts of new GA concepts can be accomplished with satisfactory fidelity.; Large empty shell composite structure and modular design to allow for flexible placement of flight hardware and adjustment of moments o inertia; Use of state-of-the-art prediction and simulation tools as well as wind/water tunnel experiments in design and data evaluation of dynamically scaled model research. The cost associated with the development of new aircraft, and especially with the testing required for FAA approval of new aircraft and aircraft technologies, is very high and hinders and/or stalls efforts by GA-companies to bring new advanced aircraft or advanced aircraft technologies to the market. Any effort of implementing novel technologies is financially risky and suffocates whatever healthy initiative and innovative ideas exist in the aviation industry."

While high bypass ratio turbofans brought significant improvements to aircraft propulsion, the future will require the use of a different propulsion technology. Turbo-electric propulsion shows great potential to address all the N+3 objectives through the use of electrically driven fans allowing for distributed propulsion. Turbofans are replaced in this approach by ducted fans driven by high power density electric motors. The electrical power is generated by a gas turbine coupled to a high speed, high power density generator. However, the turbo-electric propulsion concept relies on the availability of electric machines with power densities (kW/m3) and specific power (kW/kg) far larger than that of conventional electric machines. Fully superconducting rotating machines have the potential to match the requirements of turbo-electric propulsion and present enabling technology for this application. Superconducting machines require operation at cryogenic temperature that can be achieved by using closed-cycle cryocoolers or liquid cryogen flow such as liquid hydrogen (LH2) that could also be used as energy carrier for propulsion. The development of turbo-electric propulsion for aircrafts requires accurate sizing of superconducting machines and performing the pertinent trade-off analysis to determine the optimum materials and operating temperature. NASA is currently using sizing models for superconducting machines developed by Dr. and his colleagues. These models were developed as part of the NASA URETI on Aeropropulsion Power and Technology (UAPT) and at the Advanced Magnet Lab (AML). The existing models are based on analytical modeling of electric machines published by Miller and Hughes and estimates of the mass of the different components of the machines assuming a given active length. Important AC loss calculations in this model are based on experimental data available in the literature AC losses in superconducting stators are very challenging to estimate as the rotating field from the rotor is phase shifted relative to the phase current which depends on the angular stator position. Furthermore, the magnitude of the applied field is not uniformly distributed, and the armature reaction tends to demagnetize the machine impacting the AC losses. While the outstanding potential of the turbo-electric propulsion has been successfully demonstrated through a few projects, higher fidelity models are needed to perform a more accurate assessment at the system level. AML proposes to develop the next generation of sizing model based on a complete 3D analysis of superconducting machines using semi-analytical methods to calculate the magnetic flux density distribution including all components of the machine. The model will include all relevant areas of design including electromagnetics, thermodynamics and mechanics. Based on semi-analytical methods, the model will enable rapid calculations as needed for system optimization. The model to be developed will be fully validated, first numerically using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and finally experimentally using a superconducting machine developed at AML. Some aspects of fully superconducting machines including the AC losses and the fault behavior have not been sufficiently studied in the past to build reliable models. We therefore propose to focus the experimental validation on those important aspects: The proposed physics-based model will allow to design and optimize aircrafts based on turbo-electric propulsion, which is the first step towards the development of the next generation of more efficient aircrafts with reduced toxic emissions and noise pollution. Such aircrafts would also allow take-off and landing during the night in cities and would dramatically reduce the cost of operation and maintenance."

A HIGH-PERFORMANCE, RADIATION-TOLERANT DETECTOR IS REQUIRED FOR THE TIME-OF-FLIGHT LASER ALTIMETER SYSTEM ON THE JUPITER EUROPA ORBITER (JEO), WHICH WILL PERFORM CRITICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF EUROPA''S TOPOGRAPHY, OCEAN TIDES, AND ICE SHELF. AVALANCHE PHOTODIODES (APDS) ARE CONVENTIONALLY CHOSEN AS DETECTORS FOR STANDARD LASER ALTIMETER SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, THE PERFORMANCE OF APDS DEGRADES SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER EXPOSURE TO HIGH LEVELS OF RADIATION. AERIUS PHOTONICS PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A NOVEL RADIATION-TOLERANT DETECTOR THAT IS SUITABLE FOR USE IN SPACE-BASED LASER-ALTIMETER SYSTEMS BY INTEGRATING A VERTICAL-CAVITY SEMICONDUCTOR OPTICAL AMPLIFIER (VCSOA) WITH A PIN PHOTODETECTOR. THE RESULTING DEVICE, KNOWN AS A VERTICAL-CAVITY AMPLIFYING DETECTOR (VCAD), IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE HIGH-GAIN, HIGH-SPEED, LOW-NOISE DETECTION AND DEMONSTRATE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN RADIATION TOLERANCE OVER APDS. THE OPTICAL PREAMPLIFICATION PROVIDED BY THE VCSOA, ALONG WITH ITS OPERATION AS A FORWARD-BIASED MAJORITY-CARRIER DEVICE, RENDERS THE VCAD SYSTEM INSENSITIVE TO RADIATION-INDUCED INCREASES IN DETECTOR DARK CURRENT NOISE AND RECEIVER ELECTRONICS NOISE. THE VCAD IS ALSO EXPECTED TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO SINGLE EVENT TRANSIENTS (SETS) THAN AN APD. AERIUS PHOTONICS HAS EXPERTISE IN VCSOA DEVELOPMENT AND HAS ALREADY DEMONSTRATED BASIC RADIATION TOLERANCE OF VCSOAS TO 300 KRAD WITH GAMMA RADIATION AND TO 300 KRAD WITH 63 MEV PROTONS. IN PHASE I OF THIS PROGRAM, AERIUS WILL DESIGN, FABRICATE AND CHARACTERIZE VCADS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO A MORE COMPREHENSIVE RADIATION TEST PLAN THAT WILL INCLUDE CONDITIONS ANTICIPATED ON THE EJSM."

It is not enough to depend on the excitement generated by NASA images. NASA must use discoveries and achievements to engage students and the education community. NASA provides meaningful, educational, and content-rich programs to inspire students at all levels to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). NASA Education partners with academia, professional associations, industry, and other agencies to provide teachers and faculty with experiences that capitalize on the excitement of NASA's missions. Education Programs provide opportunities for involvement in NASA's research efforts to encourage students to pursue higher education in STEM areas. To ensure a pipeline of highly trained people prepared to meet mission requirements within NASA, as well as in industry and academia, NASA must: motivate students to pursue careers in STEM areas; provide educators with unique teaching tools and compelling teaching experiences; ensure that public resources are invested wisely; and fully engage minority and underrepresented students, educators, and researchers in NASA's education programs.

IN THIS SBIR PROJECT, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL METHOD, ADAPTIVE CHEMISTRY, TO ENABLE SUCH DETAILED MODELING. THIS METHOD ADAPTS THE REACTION MECHANISM USED IN CFD TO LOCAL REACTION CONDITIONS. INSTEAD OF A SINGLE COMPREHENSIVE REACTION MECHANISM THROUGHOUT THE COMPUTATION, SMALLER, LOCALLY VALID REDUCED MODELS ARE USED TO ACCURATELY CAPTURE THE CHEMICAL KINETICS AT A SMALLER COST. OUR ADAPTIVE CHEMISTRY APPROACH SEEKS TO OBTAIN A REDUCED MODEL GUARANTEED TO BE VALID WITHIN THE VARIABLE RANGE FOR EACH GRID POINT, AND CONTROLS ERRORS RIGOROUSLY WITHOUT EVALUATING THE VERY EXPENSIVE FULL MODEL. ADAPTIVE CHEMISTRY ALSO DYNAMICALLY CONSTRUCTS A REDUCED MODEL LIBRARY BASED ON REAL-TIME REACTION CONDITIONS TO PREVENT LARGE MEMORY OVERHEAD FOR ARBITRARY SOLUTION TRAJECTORIES. THIS ALSO ALLOWS ADAPTIVE CHEMISTRY TO BE EASILY EXTENDABLE TO TRANSIENT PROBLEMS. FINALLY, ADAPTIVE CHEMISTRY ALLOWS USERS TO SET A CONSTRAINT ON THE LARGEST MODEL SIZE BY USING A SKELETAL MODEL, BUT SELECTS EACH REDUCED MODEL BASED ON THE FULL, DETAILED CHEMISTRY, WHICH OBTAINS A GUARANTEED OPTIMAL SOLUTION MORE EFFICIENTLY COMPARED TO THE TRADITIONAL SKELETAL MODEL METHODS.  IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL DEVELOP AN ERROR-CONTROLLED REDUCED-SPECIES ADAPTIVE CHEMISTRY SOFTWARE PACKAGE THAT CAN BE EASILY INTERFACED WITH ANY CFD SOLVER. THE FIRST OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING NEEDED METHODS FOR ERROR-CONTROLLED REDUCED-SPECIES ADAPTIVE CHEMISTRY FOR STEADY-STATE REACTING FLOW SIMULATIONS. THE SECOND OBJECTIVE IS TO IMPLEMENT THE AVAILABLE METHODS INTO A MODULAR PACKAGE THAT CAN BE EASILY INTERFACED WITH ANY CFD SOLVER.

Such an architecture enhances the adaptability and survivability of space systems, while also shortening development timelines and reducing the barrier-to-entry for participation in the national security space industry. The program is predicated on the development of open interface standards-from the physical wireless link layer, through the network protocol stack, and including the real-time resource sharing middleware and cluster flight logic that can enable the emergence of a space global commons which would enhance the mutual security posture of all participants through interdependence.

HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE IN SCALING MICRO (<100 W) EP DEVICES UP AS WELL AS SCALING MACRO (>1 KW) EP DEVICES DOWN IS THE LACK OF A COMPATIBLE NEUTRALIZER TECHNOLOGY IN THE MESO SCALE (<1 KW). TRADITIONALLY, THE TECHNOLOGY USED FOR SPACECRAFT NEUTRALIZATION HAS BEEN THE HOLLOW CATHODE, THOUGH HOLLOW CATHODES REQUIRE AN UNSATISFACTORY FRACTION OF A PROPULSION SYSTEM''S PROPELLANT AND POWER IN THE MESO-SCALE REGIME. IN FACT, THEY REQUIRE SUCH A LARGE AMOUNT OF PROPELLANT AND POWER THAT SYSTEM EFFICIENCY IS REDUCED BY 50-100%. IN ADDITION, USING A HOLLOW CATHODE CAUSES UNDESIRABLE SPECIFIC IMPULSE REDUCTION.  THE MOST PROMISING TECHNOLOGY FOR MESO-SCALE NEUTRALIZERS IS FIELD EMISSION (FE), WHICH REQUIRES THE USE OF NANO-SCALE SHARP EMITTERS AND HIGH ELECTRIC FIELDS TO ESTABLISH A BEAM OF ELECTRONS. THE DRAWBACK OF FE DEVICES IS THAT THE NANO-SCALE EMITTERS BECOME DAMAGED WHEN OPERATED IN ELEVATED PRESSURE ENVIRONMENTS (10-5 TORR), CAUSING CATASTROPHIC FAILURE. THE RESEARCH PROPOSED HERE IS TO DEVELOP FIELD-EMISSION CATHODES FOR USE IN MESO-SCALE EP THAT ELIMINATE TIP DEGRADATION NOT THROUGH ATTEMPTS TO MINIMIZE TIP WEAR, BUT INSTEAD BY INCORPORATING SELF-ASSEMBLING NANOSTRUCTURES THAT CAN REPEATEDLY RE-GENERATE DAMAGED EMITTER TIPS IN SPACE AND FULLY RESTORE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF A DAMAGED OR DEGRADED CATHODE. THE PROCEDURE IS THE EQUIVALENT OF HAVING A MEMS FABRICATION AND REPAIR LAB ON-BOARD THE SPACECRAFT.  THE RE-GENERABLE EMITTERS PROPOSED HERE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED IN THE LABORATORY IN WORK BY MAKELA, ET. AL. DATING BACK TO 2007. THE RE-GENERABLE NEUTRALIZERS COULD ENABLE HIGHLY EFFICIENT, HIGH-ISP, LOW-MASS PROPULSION SYSTEMS OPERATING BETWEEN A FEW WATTS AND 1 KW BY EITHER SCALING EXISTING MICRO TECHNOLOGIES UP OR SCALING EXISTING MACRO TECHNOLOGIES DOWN."

PHASE I WORK DEMONSTRATED THAT WITH A PROPER DESIGN OF THE PROBE NOSE, INGESTION HOLES FOR GAS SAMPLING DO NOT INTERFERE WITH PORT PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS. VARIATIONS OF THIS PROBE WILL BE ABLE TO OPERATE IN HARSH ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENTS. HIGH-FREQUENCY RESPONSE AND RESISTANCE TO WATER SPRAY WERE ACCOMMODATED BY MOUNTING THE PRESSURE SENSORS IN SMALL CHAMBERS VERY CLOSE TO THE PROBE NOSE SURFACE. TO RETURN THE ABSOLUTE INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY OF AIR AND CALCULATE ATMOSPHERIC TURBULENCE, THE MOTION OF THE PROBE AND THE AIRCRAFT WILL BE MEASURED. TO THIS END, THE COMPONENTS OF AN ATTITUDE HEADING REFERENCE SYSTEM (AHRS), NAMELY ACCELEROMETERS, MAGNETOMETERS, GPS AND OTHER ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT HAVE BEEN ASSEMBLED, AND TESTED. THESE COMPONENTS WILL BE PACKAGED INTO A STAND-ALONE PROBE SYSTEM THAT WILL INCLUDE AN A/D BOARD CONVERTER AND A MICROCOMPUTER. SOFTWARE FOR POST-PROCESSING OF DATA WILL BE DEVELOPED.
