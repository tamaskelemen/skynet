In order for these missions to achieve maximum scientific return, laboratory studies must be carried out to provide the necessary data base for astronomical investigations at these wavelengths. Because heterodyne instrumentation is a major component of these projects, knowledge of atomic and molecular transition frequencies are crucial for their success. One class of molecular line transitions that are unique to the sub-mmifar IR regions arise from diatomic metal hydride species, both the neutral (MH) and singly ionized (MH+) compounds. Because of their low moments of inertia, the pure rotational transitions of these molecules occur only at sub-mm wavelengths and into the infrared region. Therefore, they are extremely good targets for sub-mm and Terahertz NASA missions. Despite their obvious importance, transition frequencies for such species are either poorly known or non-existent. The purpose of this proposal is to continue to assemble a complete data base of highly accurate (1 part in lO(7)) rotational rest frequencies for metal hydride molecules of astrophysical interest. During the past grant period, the P.I. has been successful in the measurement of the pure rotational spectrum of several hydrides, both neutrals and ions, including AIH, CrH, and SH+. In the process, a new velocity modulation spectrometer system has been developed at sub-mm wavelengths that has been very successful in selectively detecting molecular ions. We propose to continue our hydride studies and investigate the neutral species SiH, FeH, TiH and MnH, as well as hydride ions such as MgH+, AlH+, SiH+, and NaH+. To date, there are no high resolution data available for any metal hydride ion outside of the P.I.'s measurements. Diatomic hydrides, both neutrals and ions, have long been considered to be building blocks of astrochemistry because they are the simplest of interstellar species. They also are thought to be present in many environments including diffuse gas, dense clouds and in shocked regions. Detection of the proposed metal hydrides will not only help complete the inventory of the cosmically abundant elements in molecular clouds, but also lead to a better evaluation of gas phase versus dust grain components of refractories. Indeed, these species may be the hidden"" carriers of the refractory elements in molecular gas and their existence could change the interpretation of the ionization state of both dense and diffuse interstellar material. In addition, examination of the hydrides in the ISM will lead to a better understanding of interstellar and circumstellar chemistry and could provide observational constraints for nucleosynthesis and dredge-up processes in late-type stars."""

Research in terrestrial settings has shown that clastic sedimentary deposits are productive host rocks for underground volatile reservoirs because of their high porosity and permeability. Sedimentary deposits on Mars are logical places to look for evidence of past or present volatile activity. Within such reservoirs, faults play an important role in directing volatile migration pathways, because faults act as either barriers or conduits. Faults are important volatile concentrators, which means that evidence of geochemical, hydrologic and biologic processes are likely concentrated at these locations. This project will analyze observations of the layered sedimentary deposits on Mars in order to generate comprehensive models and maps of paleo-subsurface, fault controlled hydraulic conductivity, as exposed at the surface today. This project builds upon recent advances in reservoir characterization and strategic background work in Mars data analysis. The PI has developed cutting-edge methodologies based on strain energy density criteria for characterizing fault-controlled pathways of volatile migration within terrestrial reservoirs. Numerical methods for characterizing fault displacement and fault plane geometries based on MOI. A topography have also been demonstrated by the ll In this proposal, these capabilities are integrated to produce an innovate approach that will extract paleo-subsurface, hydrogeologic information from existing Mars data. These methodologies remain robust through the natural range of geomaterial behavior, therefore approximate mechanical and chemical data for the layered deposits (from Ml K i will produce meaningful results. The resulting maps of fault-controlled hydraulic conductivity will have immediate implications for understanding past hydrogeologic environments on Mars and for identifying promising sites for future surface exploration. The goal of this project is consistent with the objectives of NASA's Strategic Plan to prepare for human exploration of Mars and beyond. The goal of this project is also directly in line with the objective of the Mars Data Analysis Program to enhance scientific return from the MGS, MO, and Ml K missions. The proposed work also supports MDAP's high-priority area of Mars research that focuses on the characterization of potential landing sites for future exploration missions. In this project, numerical methods that have already been developed and proven will be used to analyze I''DS-released Mars data. This project represents an innovative approach to integrating existing ground-and orbit-based data sets in order to enhance scientific understanding of geologic processes on Mars and to better characterize potential landing sites for future exploration."

Clues to recent climate change are hidden in the morphology of southern hemisphere dunes. A latitudinal shift in dune morphology consistent with stabilized, inactive dunes coincides with the boundary of ground ice inferred from morphology [e.g., Maegotd, 20041, Neutron Spectrometer data [Feldman et a!., 20041, and a ground ice model [Mellon et a]., 20041. Equatorward of -60"" S, dune slipface crests are crisp, consistent with active dunes. Dunes poleward of this -60'' S boundary display rounded crests and appear coalesced, as though deformed in a gravity-driven process. Sand dunes must form in an environment in which wind energy is great enough to overcome the forces of both gravity and interparticle cohesion. In the high southern latitudes, ground ice is estimated to be present with a water-equivalent mass of greater than 20% (based on a two-layer model) [Feldman et al., 20041 and at a depth of less than -0.5 m [Mellon et al., 20041. This work seeks to test the following hypothesis: like many terrestrial dune fields, the martian dunes of the southern mid- and high-latitudes formed under different climatic conditions, when sand was more easily mobilized by the wind. Since that time, the dunes have been locked in place by ground ice, and erosive processes have begun to degrade dune crests and slopes. The work will take place in three stages. In the first stage, THEMIS VIS and MOC Narrow Angle images of dunes poleward of 55"" S will be examined and categorized according to their state of degradation. Various causes for dune inactivity will be quantified. For example, a latitudinal trend in thermal inertia may indicate a varying amount of cohesion in dune sand that may be caused by salt cementation or the presence of ground ice. Salt cementation may be distinguished from ice cementation by the identification of sulfates in dune fields using THEMIS IR images. In the second stage, we will use a ground ice model to predict water ice table depths and seasonal C02 ice cover for the degraded dune fields at various orbital stages in the past 5 Ma. We will construct a record of potential ""dry"" and ""icy"" epochs, which indicates when sand was mobile and immobile, respectively. In the final stage, we will carefully reconstruct, where possible, the orientations and morphology of now inactive dunes. These orientations will be compared with available GCM wind predictions for the current climate. The degree of rounding of dune crests and leveling of dune slopes will be measured by constructing photoclinometric profiles across frost-covered (uniform albedo) dunes in MOC Narrow Angle images and constraining these profiles with MOLA tracks. The investigation of this hypothesis will impact the understanding of climate shifts, dune  morphology, and climate-dependent atmospheric circulation patterns. Calculating ice table depths and measuring the quantity of sulfate-bearing materials in dune fields will not only provide information on the processes that stabilize dunes, it will also provide an independent test of the impact of such processes on thermal inertia derivations. Predicting ice table depth as a function of varying orbital parameters will be the first attempt to construct the history of sediment availability on another planet, and it is critical to determining the sediment state of dune fields on Mars. The deduction of ancient wind patterns from epochs when the ice table was too deep to restrict dune activity will produce a record of the atmospheric response to known and dated climate changes. Study of the spatial patterns of dune crest rounding and other erosional features will provide an understanding of the extent"""

THE PLUME-RISE PARAMETERIZATION SCHEME SIMULATES THE CONSEQUENCES OF STRONG BUOYANCY OF HOT GASES EMITTED FROM BIOMASS BURNING, INCLUDING BOTH DRY AND CLOUD-ASSOCIATED (PYROCUMULUS) LOFTING.  THE SCHEME WAS FIRST ADAPTED FROM A REGIONAL MODEL.  THE CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLUME-RISE PARAMETERIZATION SCHEME INTO THE GLOBAL MODEL PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF PLUME-RISE ON LONG RANGE TRANSPORT.  THE CAM SIMULATION WITH THE PLUME-RISE PARAMETERIZATION SCHEME SHOWS A SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT OF THE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE MODELED AND AIRCRAFT-MEASURED VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION OF CO OVER SOUTHERN AFRICA BIOMASS BURNING.  THE PLUME-RISE MECHANISM PLAYS CRUCIAL ROLE IN LOFTING BIOMASS BURNING POLLUTANTS TO THE MIDDLE TROPOSPHERE.  IN THE PRESENCE OF DEEP CONVECTION WE FOUND THAT THE PLUME-RISE MECHANISM RESULTS IN A DECREASE OF CO CONCENTRATION IN THE UPPER TROPOSPHERE.  THE PLUME RISE DEPLETES THE BOUNDARY LAYER, AND THUS LEAVES LOWER CONCENTRATIONS OF CO TO BE LOFTED BY THE DEEP CONVECTION PROCESS.  THE EFFECT OF THE PLUME-RISE ON FREE TROPOSPHERE (CO) CONCENTRATION IS MORE IMPORTANT FOR THE SOURCE AREA (SHORT-DISTANCE TRANSPORT) THAN FOR REMOTE AREAS (LONG-DISTANCE TRANSPORT).  THE PLUME-RISE SCHEME ALSO INCREASES THE CO EXPORT FLUXES FROM AFRICA TO THE ATLANTIC AND INDIAN OCEANS.  THESE RESULTS FURTHER CONFIRM AND EXTENT PREVIOUS FINDINGS IN A REGIONAL MODEL STUDY.  EFFECTIVE LOFTING OF LARGE CONCENTRATION OF CO BY THE PLUME-RISE MECHANISM ALSO HAS IMPLICATION FOR LOCAL AIR QUALITY FORECAST IN AREAS AFFECTED BY OTHER FIRE-RELATED POLLUTANTS."""

In addition, we propose to derive mid-latitude tropospheric ozone distribution in summer from the SAM to understand where industrial pollution occurs and where the pollutants are transported. We will use independent observations from ozonesondes for direct comparison not only in tropical latitudes but also at higher latitudes when appropriate (e.g., summertime). Theoretical calculations in the Goddard Earth Observing System chemical transport model (GEOS- HEM), or Harvard model, will serve to compare the tropospheric ozone spatial distribution, temporal variation along with fire counts and CO observations from MOPITT and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) for indirect comparison."

The main purpose of this program is to produce and deliver to NASA three Tracking and Data Relay Satellites designated as TDRS H, I and J. These satellites will be used to continue the present function of the existing TDRS Spacecraft. The TDRS H, I and J shall be fully compatible with, and be capable of functioning as a part of, the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) as implemented and operated by the White Sands Complex (WSC) which includes the Second TDRS Ground Terminal (STGT) and the White Sands Ground Terminal Upgrade (WSGTU). The TDRS H, I, and J Program shall encompass all of the efforts required to design, develop, build, test, ship, and support the launch and on-orbit activation of three Tracking and Data Relay Satellites. These satellites shall be delivered to NASA at the Eastern Test Range. The contractor shall be responsible for providing necessary efforts required for the pre-launch and launch operations with the expendable launch vehicle provided by the Government. Upon successful injection into a geosynchronous orbit, the contractor shall perform a checkout and activation of the spacecraft and shall support the integration of the spacecraft into the operational Space Network. The contractor is required to deliver three satellites that are fully compatible and operational with the remainder of the TDRSS and all TDRSS users. Changes to the existing space-to-space link between the TDRS and the users, and changes to other existing operational interfaces between user spacecraft and existing user services are not permitted. The WSC, in its STGT and WSGTU implementation, will operate the TDRS H, I and J to provide the specified user services. The contractor's delivered satellites and other efforts must meet all specifications of TDRS-RP-SY-001. The operations of the TDRS H, I, and J system and spacecraft shall, quantitatively and qualitatively, perform as well as or better than the existing TDRS and the existing WSC flight operations. In the event that the contractor's satellite design or implementation is not fully compatible and operational with the baseline WSC and TDRSS as provided by NASA, the contractor is responsible for designing, implementing, documenting and validating changes to the WSC, to assure the required compatibility and operability. The Ka-Band Option service shall have all of the attributes of the existing Ku-Band service except for the full time simulation and verification capability known in the STGT implementation as the end-to-end test system. The baseline configuration of the WSC includes six Space Ground Link Terminals (SGLT's). Four SGLT's shall be changed to accommodate the TDRS H, I, and J design. The changes made by the contractor to the WSC must not adversely affect the operations of the WSC with the F-l through F-7 spacecraft. Additionally, the effort of implementing these changes by the contractor shall not cause any adverse impacts to on-going operations except for the temporary removal of a single SGLT at a time. The contractor shall also design, develop, implement, test and deliver the TDRS H, I, and J Spacecraft Emulator (TSE) and the Real-Time Telemetry Monitoring System (RTMS)."

Equatorial Spread-F (ESF) refers to the presence of plasma irregularities at low- and equatorial latitudes in the nighttime ionosphere. ESF irregularities severely impact radio communications and navigational systems over a wide range of frequencies that adversely affect commercial and defense applications. The development of these irregularities is highly unpredictable. Even during the ''ESF season'' when various onset parameters are nearly identical, ESF occurs on one night and is completely absent on the other. Scientifically, this is a key-missing element in our understanding of plasma instabilities at low latitudes. This proposed work will carry out daytime optical measurements to investigate the roles of neutral parameters, such as the meridional and vertical winds and waves that are known to be effective triggers to the ESF. For the first time in history, we will have a large field-of-view multiwavelength spectrograph that is ideally suited to answer these relevant issues. We will carry out simultaneous daytime measurements using three emissions at 5577, 6300 and 7774 A, which originate around 100, 230 and 300 km, respectively.  These measurements will enable us to investigate waves and their direction of propagation at three different altitudes. The results from this study will not only resolve issues surrounding the precursors to ESF but will also substantially enhance our understanding of the interaction of daytime and nighttime phenomena of the low-latitude/ equatorial electrodynamics in the upper atmosphere.  We plan to operate the new instrument at Carmen Alto, in Chile. This data will be used in conjunction with the multi-diagnostics of the Multi-Instrumented Studies of Equatorial Thermosphere Aeronomy (MISETA) consortium operating in the American longitude sector as well as Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite and Communicational/Navigational Outage Forecast System (C/NOFS) mission (scheduled to be launched in 2006). Furthermore, Jicamarca Unattended Long-term Investigations Atmosphere (JULIA) radar data, Jicamarca Radio Observatory (JRO) data, Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) data will be available for independent confirmation of the occurrence of ESF irregularities and for the information on the background thermosphere/ionosphere conditions in conjunction with our ground-based data. This dayglow data at multiple wavelengths will add to the rich database to the NASA LWS research and will be a unique resource to the aeronomy community."

The region has long been considered an important terrestrial analog for Mars because of its generally cold-and-dry climate and because it contains a suite of landforms at macro-, meso-, and microscales that resemble closely those observed on the Martian surface. On the basis of our recent recent work we propose to document these important Mars analog microenvironments for use by the Mars research and exploration community. The Dry Valleys region includes at least three microclimate zones and geomorphic processes and resultant landforms within these zones vary considerably. The microclimate zones include a coastal thaw zone, an inland mixed zone, and a stable upland frozen zone; zones are defined on the basis of varying atmospheric temperatures, soil moisture, and relative humidity. Subtle variations in these climate parameters result in considerable variation in the distribution and morphology of 1) gullies (macroscale features); 2) polygons, including ice-wedge, sand-wedge, and sublimation-type polygons, as well as viscous-flow features, including solifluction lobes, gelifluction lobes, and buried glaciers (mesoscale features); and 3) variations in rock-weathering processes/features, including salt weathering, thermals stress, wind erosion, and desert varnish (microscale features). One of the major goals of this proposal is to bring this important set of terrestrial cold-polar desert, microenvironment-Mars analogs to the Mars community in order to help quantify the atmospheric, climatological, and geologic processes on Mars and to make advances in our understanding of the evolution of climate, water, and potential habitats for extraterrestrial life. This study is thus designed to produce a geological dataset for important Mars-relevant environments on Earth that can be used in future research and automated and human exploration planning."

Magnetized crustal provinces are further evidence for very ancient crustal formation (Acuna et al., 1999, Connerney et al., 1999). For Mars, our previous research indicates that the process of magma ocean fractional crystallization and subsequent mantle overturn is consistent with the formation of ancient crustal regions. On the Moon, magma ocean processes are thought to be responsible for the formation of the anorthitic highlands (Warren, 1985). If both the Martian and lunar earliest crusts were created by magma ocean processes, why does Mars lack a conspicuous plagioclase element? The Moon has likely been a completely dry body from its formation from heated material following the giant impact with the Earth (Hartman and David, 1975). Its shallow pressure range and dry composition both encourage plagioclase formation. Mars is known to have been a wetter planet in its past, and its high mantle iron content indicates more oxidizing initial conditions than were present on the Moon or Earth. Water in silicate melt suppresses plagioclase formation, and the higher pressure range of the Martian interior further limits its stability field. Water, then, may be one of the dominant variables in determining the outcomes of magma ocean crystallization and subsequent evolution of the terrestrial planets. Primary research areas: We propose to extend our magma ocean solidification and subsequent planetary evolution to the study of a wet magma ocean and its implications for creating an early steam atmosphere on Mars as well as a heterogeneously hydrous mantle with present-day implications for mantle viscosity, convective vigor, and magmatic source regions. These models make predications about the age and composition of the oldest Martian crust, about the compositions and ages of mantle reservoirs, and about the volumes and locations of water on the planet today. The proposed work should form an important link between theoretical modeling of early planetary formation and mission data from the planet today. Objectives: This proposal seeks funding for a three-year period, allowing work toward understanding the role of water in early planetary evolution that builds on the strong progress we have made to date (Elkins-Tanton et al., 2003; Elkins-Tanton and Parmentier, 2004). The three major proposed research areas are: 1. Applying models for magma ocean crystallization and overturn to a hydrous mantle composition, 2. Continuing work on the physics of crystallization of the magma ocean, and 3. Comparing predictions with surface and remote sensing data for Mars; and comparing predictions for Mars with those for other terrestrial planets, in particular, with the Earth and Moon."

Compared to the more normal flares where the soft X-ray emission rises well before the hard X-ray emission, this type of early impulsive flares offers the following significant advantages: (1) Evidence for a low-energy cutoff in the nonthermal electron spectrum can be identified at lower energies in the X-ray spectrum because of the relatively low intensity of the thermal emission. This will allow a more accurate estimate to be made of the total energy in the nonthermal electrons. (2) Absence of a strong thermal source from loops allows the detection of any nonthermal sources in the beginning of flares, which will provide critical information on particle acceleration and transport. (3) Possible mechanisms for filling the loops with heated plasma can be differentiated using the RHESSI soft X-ray images. Chromospheric evaporation appears as filling from below while direct heating of plasma already in the loops or in the current sheet from which the loops are formed appears as filling from above. This study is crucial to understanding energy release and heating mechanisms in flares. (4) A comparative study of the more normal flares will be made to investigate possible causes of the early impulsive flares and the particle acceleration mechanism, and how they might different from the more normal flares. I plan to actively participate in two excellent existing education/outreach programs, one at the Goddard Space Flight Center and one at the Catholic University of America. At Goddard, I will interact with teachers and students of sixth grade and promote a positive attitude in them toward math and science using RHESSI as a vehicle. At the Catholic University, I will be involved with an experimental physical science curriculum for undergraduate, pre-service K-8 science teachers. Solar images and movies from recent space missions including RHESSI will be used to educate the future teachers basic physical science."

The pulsar ionizes its surroundings as it moves through the binary orbit, producing X-rays while accreting some of the ambient stellar wind from B0.5 lab supergiant. The FUSE spectra will be used to 1) characterize the phase-dependent X-ray ionization of the stellar wind and its density distribution, including the photoionization wake at 55 = 0.6 - 0.9, 2) study enhanced abundances in the atmosphere of the primary, and 3) search for the 283-s pulsar periodicity in the stellar wind lines. 0 VI 1032-38, S IV 1063-73, and P V 11 18-28 are the primary diagnostics to achieve these objectives. These line profiles are unsaturated across the full velocity range of the stellar wind, resulting in a complete picture of the run of optical depth (or Mw)ith velocity. Strong saturation in the stellar wind lines at longer wavelengths (N V, C IV, Si IV) have precluded such studies. P V is the only unsaturated transition of a dominant ionization stage in the wind, hence it provides a direct measure of the bulk wind properties. Chandra HETGS spectra show the temperature of the X-ray ionized region of the wind is -120,000 K, making 0 VI an excellent diagnostic of this plasma. Our recent Cycle 4 observations of another HMXB system (4U1700-37) demonstrate the power of the FUSE region for studying the effects of the X-ray source on the stellar wind that feeds the accretion."""

Lidar sensors have generally been deployed on airborne platforms, and as a consequence, almost all of this work has been accomplished at the scale of single study areas,with a few studies at the regional scale. This has limited the science that could be performed with lidar observations, and limited the utility of the resulting work. Many of these studies have served as proof-of-concept"" exercises, without the spatial extent needed to provide functional products, or make estimates of direct interest to science. With the data already collected by the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), we have the ability to move lidar remote sensing from the proof-of-concept stage to actual applications of use to a range of topical interests (from forest management to carbon cycle science). Nevertheless, the movement of GLAS-like data from the realm of specialists, to part of the toolbox used by remote sensing and carbon cycle scientists, is not certain. Two barriers hinder the spread of lidar remote sensing; the technical difficulty of working with the data, and the lack of work scaling up existing approaches to the regional and global scales that GLAS makes possible. In this proposal, we seek to catalyze carbon science applications of GLAS in two ways. First, we will combine our work estimating forest canopy height using GLAS and our experience with characterizing the vertical structure of forests, to create a simplified data product that combines relevant information from the GLAS data products, and add our calibrated estimates of forest canopy height and canopy vertical distribution. In addition we will create a small toolbox to interface this data with commonplace GIS and data analysis tools. Secondly, we will go beyond our existing work estimate forest canopy height and biomass (used to estimate carbon storage) to demonstrate that it is possible to estimate aspects of regeneration, productivity,and subtle cryptic disturbances that are important factors in carbon flux. We expect that the proposed work will make a valuable contribution to the overall ICESat research program, and that it will set a precedent for a new class of lidar remote sensing applications, which will increase future demand for spaceborne lidar sensors."""

In this study, we propose to investigate the H20 profile retrievals from AURA within the context of the precise and accurate - but geographically sparse high spectral resolution solar occultation observations from the Canadian ACE-FTS instrument. The aim of this investigation is to both evaluate the ACE and AURA retrievals by comparing coincident observations and to use additional information available from the occultation measurements to provide ancillary constraints on the physics and chemistry that determine the water vapor mixing ratio. In particular, we intend to retrieve from the ACE spectra profile information on HDO and other convective tracers in addition to H20 such as CO, 03, and HCCH. Combined with the global observations from AURA, these observations will provide a new view of the atmospheric hydrological cycle."

THIS PROGRAM ADDRESSES THE REQUEST FOR RPS CONVERSION TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT IN NRA-02-OSS-01.  THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT IS TO DEMONSTRATE A STATIC TPV POWER CONVERTER SUITABLE FOR USE WITH AN ADVANCED RPS USING GPHS HEAT SOURCES, BRINGING THIS CONVERTER TECHNOLOGY (RTPV) TO TRL 5 AT THE END OF THE THIRD YEAR.  TPV CONVERTS RADIANT ENERGY FROM A HOT EMITTER TO ELECTRICAL POWER USING PV CELLS.  TPV USES ADVANCED PV CELLS TO UTILIZE A BROADER, SPECTRALLY-TUNED RANGE OF WAVELENGTHS FOR MORE EFFICIENT POWER CONVERSION THAN SOLAR PV CELLS.  SPECTRAL CONTROL, INCLUDING SELECTIVE EMITTER, PV CELL, AND FILTER CHARACTERISTICS, IS KEY TO HIGH PERFORMANCE.  LIFETIME TESTS ARE PLANNED.  STEPS IN THE DEVELOPMENT INCLUDE: YEAR 1:  DEVELOP THE TPV MODULE (TRL 3) - DEVELOP, FABRICATE, DEMONSTRATE AND SELECT THE BEST OPTIONS FROM VARIOUS EMITTERS, PV CELLS, AND FILTER APPROACHES, WITH SUPPORT EFFORTS TO DEVELOP THE PRELIMINARY CONVERTER DESIGN AND TO ADDRESS TWO KEY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT CONVERTER LIFETIME:  RADIATION EFFECTS ON THE PV CELLS AND MATERIALS TRANSFER.  YEAR 2:  DEMONSTRATE A PROTOTYPIC RTPV OPTICAL CAVITY/CONVERTER (TRL 4) - FABRICATE AND TEST AN ELECTRICALLY HEATED BASELINE CONVERTER WITH PROTOTYPICAL DESIGN (OPTICAL CAVITY/CONVERTER AND IMMEDIATE STRUCTURE), WITH SUPPORTING MODELING AND TESTING EFFORTS, AS WELL AS CONTINUE RADIATION EXPOSURE AND MATERIALS LIFE TESTS.  YEAR 3:  DEMONSTRATE A BREADBOARD RTPV OPTICAL CAVITY/CONVERTER AND LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE OF A PROTOTYPIC CONVERTER (TRL 5) - BUILD A BREADBOARD MODEL WITH THE OPTIMUM CONVERTER DESIGN AND A POWER CONVERTER MODULE, THEN TEST IN A THERMAL VACUUM CHAMBER; CONCLUDE SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO DEMONSTRATE LONG LIFE WITH MINIMAL POWER DECREASE.  RECENT ADVANCES IN INGAAS PV CELL, FILTER, AND SLECTIVE EMITTER TECHNOLOGY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THE PERFORMANCE OF TPV SYSTEMS TO THE POINT THAT TPV SYSTEMS ARE NOW COMPETITIVE IN CONVERSION EFFICIENCY A ND SPECIFIC POWER WITH DYNAMIC POWER SYSTEMS.  SPECIFICALLY, TPV CONVERTER EFFIFIENCY OF 20% HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED AT 1330 K FOR SINGLE CELLS (SIERGIEJ ET AL. 2002) AND FOR A 16-CELL ARRAY IN AN OPTICAL CAVITY DURING THE YEAR 1 EFFORT.  WE EXPECT TO IMPROVE ON THIS."

In this proposal, GMU's Center for Spatial Information Science and Systems (CSISS), which LAITS is part of, proposes to enter the second-phase cooperation for the Joint Geo-Informatics Laboratory (JGIL) with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The performance period for the proposed cooperation will be three years starting July 1, 2006. JGIL will conduct information technology research, prototyping, system development in support of NASA Code 610.2 and other laboratories at Goddard Space Flight Center related to applying information technologies to Earth and space sciences. General categories of JGIL projects fall within but not limited to the following categories: research and development in geo-information theory and technology; prototypes of geospatial data, information, knowledge, decision-supporting, and modeling systems; science data, information products and services; development and support of operational data and information systems; development and implementation of geo-informatic standards; scientific and technical support to NASA's international and national commitments and activities; research in other disciplines (e.g., space and planetary sciences) that can use the technology and systems developed by or experiences and knowledge of JGIL. Although the initial project of JGIL-II has been identified and described in this agreement, additional projects of JGIL will be added into the cooperative agreement during the performance period of this, agreement as argumentations, depending on successfully securing funds by JGIL researchers (both GMU and GSFC researchers) through solicited and un-solicited proposals."

EO measures the Earth system state while ESM predicts the evolution of the state. A feedback mechanism processes EO measurements and feeds them into ESM during model runs or as initial conditions. A feed-forward mechanism analyzes the ESM predictions against science goals for scheduling optimized/targeted observations. The SEPS framework automates the Feedback and Feed-forward mechanisms (theFF-loop). Scientists from GMU, GSFC, and UBMC will collaborate to 1) develop a general SEPS framework for dynamic, interoperable coupling between ESMs and EO, based on open, consensus-based standards; 2) inplement and deploy the the framework and plug in diverse sensors and data systems to demonstrate the plug-in-EO-and-play capability; and 3) prototype a Bird- Migration-Model-to-aid-avian-influenza-prediction SEPS and an atmospheric chemistry composition SEPS using this framework, to demonstrate the frameworks'' plug-in-ESM-and-play capability and its applicability as a common infrastructure for supporting the focus areas of NASA research. This project will significantly advance 1) dynamic, interoperable and live coupling of ESM with the sensor web; 2) the sensor web from concept to peration with existing sensors and data sources; and 3) the use of service-oriented architecture in modeling and integration. The project will improve the accuracy and timeliness of monitoring and predicting rapidly changing Earch phenomena, suca as sever weather and air pollution. The 3-year project will start in October 2006. The entry TRL is 4 ad the exit TRL is 7."
